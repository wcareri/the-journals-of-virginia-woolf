### Saturday 21 July

A new nib. But I want sometimes to describe people, & here is our visit to the Rothschilds fading in my mind. We went down on Thursday, starting about 4.30, driving through that very spacious country that I always honour by planting myself down in a house in the midst of the corn. There are such houses; & the road runs by open unfenced fields. Why are fields always hedged off in England? The other way is much better: So to Merton Hall: a grey old house, half chapel, or college; half the usual rich young couples version of life: 4 kittens & a sickly pathetic marmoset; Barbara in a great hat, very pregnant, perched on a chair; long room, bowls of flowers, tea luxuriously spread at 6.30. I asked for a pale stale cup. She telephoned for the footman to bring long lemonades with ginâ€”no without. And where is Mr R.? Asleep maâ€™am. Then V. came in, a slab of beefsteak, fat, thick, red lipped, in his open shirt. Sparring with B. about the rent they paid. Oughtnâ€™t I to know? Donâ€™t I pay it? & so on, partly for our edification. â€˜Blubsyâ€™ is one of his words. â€˜Barbara went blubsy.â€™ Half asleep, he said, after a lunch party, Venetia Montagu & two of her lovers, one by the way Grey Walter, the son of our old cook. B. sat very upright, painted, like a cornflower. Wild, vivid; & then we walked about the garden, stuck like a jam tartâ€”little square box edged beds with single flowers in them; a pretentious uncared for garden. Go & get your note book, he jibed: no I wont. Oh but she always has a note book. One thing a little shocked me; his saying, â€˜I dont get much time for Barbaraâ€™. This he said perhaps boasting again, as he walked me down the narrow paths; he said he was determined not to become a specialist like the other science dons, thus spent so many hours with science, so many with books, which doesnt leave much time for Barbara. She had snapped at him; putting her heel down, when he wanted to tell me what Dadie had told her aboutâ€”& the servant & the boy all in the same bed asâ€” no thats not quite it, but it was scandal on those lines. B. had been drawing (like Mary, I thought) Dadieâ€™s confidences. As it appears from this, Victor told me the story, as we walked. Then dinner on the lawn, & they refused the ice: a luxurious decorative dinner. So in to the library: a steel bookcase packed with first editions, each sealed in a red morocco case; which we had out, Gulliverâ€™s Travels, Boswell, Wordsworth, Swift, all laid on the floor; thousands of pounds worth, bought since last year, & I had set him reading with my Common Reader. Ah but this isnt the way to read, I almost said. Too easy; sitting at Sothebyâ€™s bidding. But then youth has enormous power, I said, for I liked him, rather, her a good deal; she is the more sensitive & civilised, he the more robust & triumphant. Youth can have a child in September: nothing it cant do: has 50 years ahead of it, living in this very lovely England, & he said the R. fortune is now at full flood again. Shall he remain a scientist & refuse to be a financier? Thats the sort of question youth can ask. He wont live with these pickers up of minute peas in Cambridge. He said that his professor, aged 40, comes out to dine, & tells very old very dreary smutty stories, all his energy having been sucked up by science: so that is another argument against the specialist. Cant connect.

We drove home at 11, & got back at 1. A lovely cool shadowed drive through the fields again, two great steeples of light searching the sky about Ware, & an aeroplane sailing among the stars. Suddenly I saw a green star moving.

Duncan ill with very bad pilesâ€”operated on last night, or, since that sounds alarming, lanced. Spoke to Janie of the snobbishness of our sympathies. Cant really sympathise with that particular disease, though the pain is terrible. Must laugh.

I have just finished, the other pen continues, though very provisionally, the first truth telling chapter: but Lord knows if I must not entirely scrap the whole thing once more. At any rate I have now got a little fresh water in my well for Here & Now. I had one of my sudden rushes listening to Monti Verde last night. Last night came a letter from Henry to my dear Aunt Virginia saying that George has left me Â£100. I feel rather rebuked & uncomfortable, I dont altogether know why, at this final tip. Shall I spend it on what? Now I have so much money. And by the way Nessa came in, rather to my shameâ€”but again, why?â€”only I like noting these queer waifs in my mindâ€”dressed in a 3/6 dress she had made herself. I know what I am going to do now: I am going to come down with both feet on this dress mania: this shyness; this tremendous susceptibility: & it is not so very difficult, once faced.

I am reading Shre plays the fag end of the morning. Have read, Pericles, Titus Andronicus, & Coriolanus.
