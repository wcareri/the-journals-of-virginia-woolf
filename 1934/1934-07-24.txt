### Tuesday 24 July

Infinitely bored with correcting, or rather inserting a snip, into, my old Sickert for those pernickety Americans, who insist that Max shall be dragâ ged in.

Dinner last night at the Hutchinsons. Let me see. Praise of my dressâ€”taken very philosophically. Desmond there & Tomâ€”dinner: not very good: one element of pleasure lessened. Talk frivolous at first. Jackâ€™s; jokes with Mary for being in love with Arlen. He sends her books. I do not altogether like Jackâ€™s jokes with Mary: her lovers &c. Then, Mary describes a party: a champagne cocktail. Tom gravely attentive. Talk gets upon whether we frighten or are frightened. Tom said I made him feel I saw through all his foibles; which perhaps I do. Talk of Patmore. Desmond expatiated, praised, placed him with Crashaw: described his love of great fires, his son Epiphany, all in the Sunday Times agreeable manner, not very close to the object: a love of little pictures. Jack robust, rather coarse; how old Victorians always had an eye to the main chance. Tom remained on the verge; yellow, bony; but I regretted having denounced the Rockâ€”so much melancholy in his face. Yes, & then, somehow to Hitler. Desmond again describing Bottomley & Pemberton Billing. I always feel he flutters & skirts, where Tom dives to the centre. And there was Leonard aquiline & lean; & so Desmond drew on to politics, & the half wit wasps whom he watched in their Hive: Fascists that is: how Hitler had dealt them a blow. So to politics & then, what with Jackâ€™s cross examination, & Tomâ€™s intentness, & Desmond burbling general goodwill & human love, & Leonardâ€™s specialised convictions, the argument blazed: how the Labour party wd come in: what it would do. But how can you make any such ridiculous claim Jack boomed. What is it going to do about unemployment, about agriculture? All these questions were put from the view of here & now, capable business men; L. ideal by comparison. How 10 sensible men â€˜round a tableâ€™, one of his phrases, could so manipulate the supply of locomotives & wheat that one country supplemented another. Oh if we were all men of good will, if we were all ready to be nice about itâ€”Then Desmond as usual praised moderation, tact, the virtues of the defunct Liberal party: how civilisation runs slowly in a great wide stream, & you must slowly facilitate its course, but by no means introduce whirlpools, cut precipices & so on. The deceased Oxford, presumably, his ideal; but this is what so depresses & baffles me in him as a critic. They heckled L. between them, & when the argument began to put its tail in its mouth, Mary asked if I would like to withdraw. We went upstairs, & she sat on the fender, & said how, being alone for the week end she had tried to write an ambitious biography. There was to be an outer story, & a second meaning; as far as I could gather. But when she had called one character George Buchanan, & another Lettice Ponsonby, they died under her hands. Could one then try to write disconnected scenes? Must they combine into a story? No need whatever I said. And she clapped her hands, as if I had given her leave; & declared that she would write scenes, & send them to me. For instance there was Syrie Maughamâ€™s party. As a person, she had not enjoyed it. I gathered that she had not had any intimacy. Then she reflected that she had danced every dance with an entirely different person: Freyberg, Arlen, & I forget who else; Lord Hambledon; had said the same thing to each; & each was entirely different. As an artist then, a dispassionate observer, the party had been a great success. Not to her as Mary. One must cease to be Mary.

Then the others came; & Tom read Mr Barkerâ€™s poems, chanting, intoning. Barker has some strange gift he thinks & dimly through a tangle of words ideas emerge. He thinks there is some melody some rhythm some emotion lacking in the Audens, & Spenders. Wants 5/- a week for this young man, who has wife & child. So home at last. The aeroplanes were droning in the sky all the time.
