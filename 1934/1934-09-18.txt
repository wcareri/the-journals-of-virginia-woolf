### Tuesday 18 September

Dadie has been gone half an hour, & I am silent after talking incessantly, it seems, & is in fact almost true, since 1 on Saturday. A. & J. came, strode in without their box. Great brown naked legged colts. Then there was Mrs Jones & Hugh: bowls: I sat & listened to the poor womans plaints; knees that lock, cant make enoâ€™; will I give her work; in a bungalow at Seaford. Then dinner: next day Angelicaâ€™s party (like the Lytton party) at Charleston. They acted; I did my poor old frenzied owl; at parting Clive, who is off to Spain till November, said But youâ€™ll get over itâ€”an arrow wh. stuck, for then I felt I had over acted. Never mind. Nessa infinitely mournful & struck, like a statue, something frozen about her. Janie. The children also saddened (not A. & J.). They acted very beautifully in Chinese clothes by the pond. Well I thought I can see this through Rogerâ€™s eyes: its right to enjoy every tint. And yet how can one? This has gone out of the dayâ€”that laughter; that energy; & we were all thinned & stunted. So home. And then after A. & J. wentâ€”& I had begun to fidget because they dont wipe their mouths & eat so muchâ€”the Keynesâ€™s & Dadie came. We did not exactly repeat the funeral talk: but it loomed over us. Lydia to me rather jarring. She did not care. Nothing much loomed over her. Dear old Dadie very charming & affectionate. We talked about Cambridge; about teaching English; I held out a bare poleâ€”I mean extended my views rashly; he was donnish, serious, very measured; believes in education; in measuring the mind, & sending youth out to Africa with â€˜an improved sense of leisureâ€™ & so on. But this rather broke down, & he admitted that he means to leave as soon as he can afford it. Peter a deathly warning. Teaching without zest a crime. Shepherd a complete buffoon; but good, because of his completeness. Dadie wants to marry, to have whitehaired children & live a romantic life with a dark haired feminine wife. As it is has to comfort his most desolate mother.

I like writing this morning because it takes off the strain on the lips. A cold dull day after all this blaze. Now we have Grahamâ€”& Mrs Wâ . but then, perhaps, peace, & an end to the book? O if that could be! But I feel 10 miles distantâ€”far awayâ€”detachedâ€”very jaded now.
