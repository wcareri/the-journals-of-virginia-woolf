### Friday 2 November

Two teeth out with a new anaesthetic: hence I write here, not seriously. And this is another pen. And my brain is very slightly frozen, like my gums. Teeth become like old roots that one breaks off. He broke, & I scarcely felt. My brain frozen thinks of Aldous & the Clarks; thinks vaguely of biography; thinks am I reviewed anywhereâ€”cant lookâ€”thinks its a fine cold day. Angelica at the Nat. Gallery. Thinks how I shall read Dante; how I did not go to Vitaâ€™s lecture; how we have refused Enid Jones next week; how we should have met Wells there; I finished the Seasons last night: that is a surface reading, such as I give poetry for the first time. Ten skins to the mind. No, I cannot write at all with a frozen brain.

I went upstairs to rinse my bleeding gumâ€”the cocaine lasts 1 an hour: then the nerves begin to feel againâ€”& opened the Spectator & read W.L. on me again. An answer to Spender. â€œI am not maliciousâ€”several people call Mrs W. Felicia Hemans.â€ This I suppose is another little scratch of the cats claws: to slip that in, by the wayâ€”â€œI dont say itâ€”others doâ€. And they are supercilious on the next page about Sickert; & soâ€” Well L. says I shd. be contemptible to mind. Yes: but I do mind for 10 minutes: I mind being in the light again, just as I was sinking into my populous obscurity. I must take a pull on myself. I dont think this attack will last more than 2 days. I think I shall be free from the infection by Monday. But what a bore it all is. And how many sudden shoots into nothingness open before me. But wait one moment. At the worst, should I be a quite negligible writer, I enjoy writing: I think I am an honest observer. Therefore the world will go on providing me with excitement whether I can use it or not. Also, how am I to balance W.L.â€™s criticism with Yeatsâ€”let alone Goldie & Morgan? Would they have felt anything if I had been negligible? And about 2 in the morning I am possessed of a remarkable sense of driving eyâ eless strength. And I have L.: & there are his books; & our life together. And freedom, now, from money paring. Andâ€¦. if only for a time I could completely forget my self, my reviews, my fame, my sink in the scaleâ€”which is bound to come now, & to last about 8 or 9 yearsâ€”then I should be what I mostly am: very rapid, excited, amused: intense. Odd, these extravagant ups & downs of reputation: compare the American in the Mercury â€¦ no, for Gods sake dont compare: let all praise & blame sink to the bottom or float to the top & let me go my ways indifferent. And care for people. And let fly, in life, on all sides.
