### Tuesday 27 March

The great scene with Nelly is now over, & of course much less violently than I supposed. She stood by the drawing room door in the full light, white & pink, with her funny rather foolish mulish face puckered up. And I made my speech correctly, & even was able to say â€œAnd I expect you want to get another place tooâ€”â€ persuasively. She had one outburstâ€”â€œI can say nothingâ€”its all because it was my night out, & I asked youâ€¦â€ which I cut short & said we had agreed to part on good terms, gave her a cheque for Â£25 & a Â£1 note for my mending â€œbut you dont owe me anythingâ€ she said, & so she went upstairs & I came down here. I suppose some further lamentation & argument, with L. perhaps is inevitable. But Lord what a relief now!
