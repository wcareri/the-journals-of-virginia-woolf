### Tuesday 7 August

A rather wet Bank holiday. Tea with Keyneses.

Maynard had had teeth out, but was very fertile. For instance: â€œYes, Iâ€™ve been 3 weeks in America. An impossible climate. In fact it has collected all the faults of all the climates. This carries out my theory about climate. Nobody could produce a great work in America. One sweats all day & the dirt sticks to ones face. The nights are as hot as the days. Nobody sleeps. Everyone is kept on the go all day long by the climate. I used to dictate articles straight off. I felt perfectly well until I left. The shipwreck was all the Captains fault. We made a bee line for the Lightship in a fog. He had the boats launched before we struck. We had the men out of the water before they were in it. Very efficient, but not a good captain. A character. A Don Juan.â€ So to German politics â€œTheyâ€™re doing something very queer with their money. I cant make out what. It may be the Jews are taking away their capital. Let me see, if 2000 Jews were each to take away Â£2,000â€”Anyhow they cant pay their Lancashire bill. Always the Germans have bought cotton from Egypt, had it spun in Lancashire: its a small bill, only Â½ a million, but they cant pay. Yet theyre buying copper all the time. Whats it for? Armaments no doubt. Thats one of the classic examples of intn tradeâ€”Now Holden has been over & says we wont go in. 20,000 people out of work. But of course thereâ€™s something behind it. What is the cause of the financial crisis? Theyre doing something foolishâ€”no Treasury control of the soldiers.â€

(but I am thinking all the time of what is to end Here & Now. I want a Chorus, a general statement, a song for 4 voices, how am I to get it? I am now almost within sight of the end. racing along: becoming more & more dramatic.

And how to make the transition from the colloquial to the lyrical, from the particular to the general?)
