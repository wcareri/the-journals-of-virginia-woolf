### Sunday 2 December

Isnt it odd? Some days I cant read Dante at all after revising the P.s: other days I find it very sublime & helpful. Raises one out of the chatter of words. But today (doing the scene at the Lodge) Iâ€™m too excited, I think it a good book today. Iâ€™m in the thick again. But I will stop at the end of the funeral scene, & calm my brain. That is I will write the play for Xmas: Freshwater a farceâ€”for a joke. And rig up my Contemporary Criticism article: & look around. David Cecil on fiction: a good book for readers, not for writersâ€”all so elementary: but some good points made, from the outside. Iâ€™ve done though with that sort of criticism. And heâ€™s often wrong: gets W.H. wrong, I think: wants to have a profound theory. Weâ€”Bâ loomsburâ yâ€”are dead; so says Joad. I snap my fingers at him. Lytton & I the two destructors.

Poor Francis lies in a hotel bedroom in Russell Sqre this rainy morning. I went in & sat with him. Quite himself with a lump on his forehead. And is aware of it all. May die under another operation, or slowly stiffen into complete paralysis. His brain may go. All this he knows; & there it was between us, as we joked. He came to the verge of it once or twice. But I cant feel any more at the momentâ€”not after Roger. I cannot go through that again. Thats my feeling. I kissed him. â€œThis is the first timeâ€”this chaste kissâ€ he said. So I kissed him again. But I must not cry, I thought, & so went. And he said, bitterly, how he had given 10 years of his life to loveâ€”to a horrid little creature. Thank God I never let you see him, he said. Gone to Russia. No I really couldnt follow him there. When I saw him firstâ€”I just came into the roomâ€”I thought I had never seen anyone so beautiful. He had talent of course. Butâ€¦.â€”So we rambled & rattled. And Hubert Waley, dark & slim, poured him out whiskey, as if they now let him have what he likes. He cant read. He lies there with one arm bandaged: in that bedroom, with the chrysanthemums, under a green silk quilt.

Today come Okampo & Hâ€”no I cant remember the name of the French journalist deposited on me by Peter. Oh damn ones friends!
