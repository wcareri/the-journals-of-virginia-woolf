### Wednesday 14 March

I cannot hold out any hope for the next 14 days. Theres the workmen everywhere; theres Nelly gay & garrulous as a lark. Can I do it? I must. I must. And I caught an influenzaâ€”a little shivery bout at Monks on Sunday; cant screw my brain up therefore; & yet have the feeling that some magnificent chapters wait me. If only the 14 days were overâ€”& I in my bed again! How human beings torture each other!

A black day, pouring rain; dirt everywhere. Let me see: there was a lovely day at Monks. There was the suffusion of blue in white cotton wool. Mr Lavender talked at the meeting about growing mushrooms. Ethel came overâ€”to deposit her horrid gnawed bone or sucked chocolateâ€”C. St Johnâ€™s praise to witâ€”at my feet. A very ruthless shoving woman in some ways. And then on the crest of the Kitty Eleanor scene comes this shiver: bed; waiting for L.; cooking dinner. Back today & a man threw a parcel containing shoes at the basement window & broke it. A thief presumably. Lady Oxford wants to meet me at Ottâ€™s. Mr Ridge the builder talking about Tenby & a little church on the rocks. The sea comes over the chapel floor. And he bought a picture in Holland Park for 7/6 that reminded him of Wales. Then the bookbinder. Thats my day. Now in the rain to Nessa.
