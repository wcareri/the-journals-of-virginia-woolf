### Sunday 12 August

This is Saxonâ€™s week end. He is in the house, this windy cold gray day, playing chess with L. Odd that I should think of â€˜honey-sweetâ€™ Queen in connection with Saxon. But he has grown rather pink & chubby in face, & very mellow & in fact charming in mind. The old eccentricities have been melted in the sunâ€”I cannot guess of what success. Is it The Treasury, or Mrs Sickert? Anyhow he is not merely a bundle of desiccated separate remarks about toothbrushes & trains: he is continuous & even suggestive. I have spent an hour or so talking with him about Shakespeare, books in general, then people: & there is some virtue in these old friends: I mean conversationally; they enrich. If I ask what about Francis? he can supplement my question with all his knowledge of the past; & that is joined to my knowledge; so that we say many things we mean. Thus, it was a good idea of mine to ask him. He stays away a good deal, it seems; has rather expanded into queer corners; the Beresfords & the Lambs. And he has bought a new book on Aristotle. Barbara & her children the bulls eye I imagine. But the other circles all to his liking. We had the Keynesâ€™s over. Old friends again. M. adroit & supple & full of that queer imaginative ardour about history, humanity; able to explain flints & the age of man from some book he has read. Silent while we gossip. Immensely amused too by little scenes, as of Mrs Hardy & the sausages. He complained that great men, Shaw & Wells, are not serious; they do their stunt. Why cant they be simple, & do no stunt? He said Shaw never said anything new, but Charlotte does. He has a ranging adventurous mind, which I enjoy. In short we old stagers have made a good job, on the wholeâ€”such was my feeling. They stayed late.

Duncan is still bad with the ridiculous torturing disease, & Nessa I suppose much worried.

Newâ s at first, through Julian, extremely optimistic about Francis. Now nothing, but perhaps more doubtful. Oh & the drought has broken: 2 carp are dead; there is the old ugly grey welter in the sky, which Iâ€™m afraid may now become â€˜weatherâ€™. But all, at this moment, rather loose, random, interesting. Vita came over very late for dinner, having been kept by a row with her mother who, says Mâ , eats pate de foie with a shoehorn. She had been accusing her footman, a cocktail party boy with fair hair called Leonard, nicknamed Lemon, of putting Lysol in her medicine. Vita thinks Harold is getting soft & domestic, because he talks of grandchildren, & wants to have a butler to brush his clothes & a spare room. Good Lord said Vita, as if I wanted grandchildren! for which exclamation I like her. In fact she wears, to me, in spite of Gâ . & the Dark Island, very well. So in to roast beef & plum tart.
