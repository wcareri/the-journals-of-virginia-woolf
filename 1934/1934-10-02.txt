### Tuesday 2 October

Yes, but my head will never let me glory sweepingly: always a tumble. Yesterday morning the old rays of light set in; & then the sharp, the very sharp pain over my eyes; so that I sat & lay about till tea; had no walk, had not a single idea of triumph or relief. L. bought me a little travelling ink pot, by way of congratulation. I wish I could think of a name. Sons & Daughters? Probably used already. Theres a mass to be done to the last chapter, which I shall, I hope, dv. as they say in some circles, I suppose still, begin tomorrow: while the putty is still soft.

So the summer is ended. Until the 9th of Sept: when Nessa came across the terraceâ€”how I hear that cry Hes deadâ€”a very vigorous, happy summer. Oh the joy of walking! Iâ€™ve never felt it so strong in me. Cowper Powys, oddly enough, expresses the same thing: the trance like, swimming, flying through the air; the current of sensations & ideas; & the slow, but fresh change of down, of road, of colour: all this churned up into a fine thin sheet of perfect calm happiness. Its true I often painted the brightest pictures on this sheet: & often talked aloud. Lord how many pages of Sons & Daughtersâ€”perhaps Daughters & Sons would give a rhythm more unlike Sons & Lovers, or Wives & Daughters,â€”I made up, chattering them in my excitement on the top of the down, in the folds.

Too many buildings, alas: & gossip to the effect that Christie & the Ringmer building Co. are buying Bottenâ€™s Farm to build on. Sunday I was worried, walking to Lewes, by the cars & the villas. But again, Iâ€™ve discovered the ghostly farm walk; & the Piddinghoe walk; & such variety & lovelinessâ€”the river lead & silver: the shipâ€”Servie of Londonâ€”going down; the bridge opened. Mushrooms & the garden at night; the moon, like a dying dolphinâ€™s eye; or red orange, the harvest moon; or polished like a steel knife; or lambent: sometimes rushing across the sky; sometimes hanging among the branchesâ€”Now in October the thick wet mist has come, thickening & blotting.

On Sunday we had Bunny & Julian; Bunny so thick & solid, like a beam out of an old tree; Julian rather smaller than usual. Bunny has grey wisps at his temples; talks like a heavy wardrobe; all heavy angular sentences. I noted how my own rushing pace, seemed too rushing, & after 10 minutes had adapted itself to Bunny.

Howâ€”doâ€”youâ€”startâ€”anâ€”aeroplane? This unheard cry, Lord what a wonder, filling sheets to an inch every Friday. Bunny has severe small blue eyes that slowly fix themselves. All rather heavy footed. Julian silent. So we walked on the Terrace. Then Duncan & Helen cameâ€”Helen in a long coat & the funny amateur hat with the green tuft that she wore at the service. It was rather fortunate that the first meeting should be among the flowers, vegetables, improvements. Then we went upstairs & talked & laughed about Roger, easily. I felt however the worn out, the used up feeling as if she were nowâ€” feeling the shallows, after the exaltation; the shingle grating, the sordidâ€”poor Helen! All the sisters conglomerate in B. St. & arrange R.â€™s picturesâ€”dating them wrongly. How one can hear R. laugh! see him padding about in his slippers. Margery is left literary executor. Tatlock smelling of drink comes round & says he wants to write R.â€™s life. Well whats to be done about our â€˜livesâ€™ I wonder? The EMF. Goldie thing to me quite futile. But this is an aside. What we talked of was Ha & Joan & Pamela & Julian; & Helen made her usual quips & severities: but all was a little watery. Her blue & pink less brightâ€”poor woman. She is very poorâ€”it seems: must give up B. St. & find a flat: must perhaps give up Rodwell. Then the problem of the childrenâ€”how facts come trooping in, when the great rush of emotion is past. I mean, this dealing with the difficulties used to be done so much by R.: at any rate, there he was, bullying her, laughing at her: forcing her to give it all up & come out to Venice, or St Remy. Now sheâ€™ll be more and more bothered, worried. But she has a great many friends.

And we went to Sissinghurst. Vita playing the Gramophone at the top of the pink tower. A blazing day. (I bought 1st edition of Mill on Floss at Websters by the way). Some constraint now, of a very simple & obvious kind, because of Gwen. She came in at 2. We were sitting under a pergola, lunching. An uneasy, nerve strained womanâ€”very tense. She told us how she had taken Miss Maddock the 70 year old secretary to the Mayfair Hotel to tea. M. had eaten crumpets & cakes. Had had no lunch. Whats to become of her? Gwen rather a doer of good. This stimulates V.â€™s sentimental easy going benevolence, I think. And we talked of Sibyl & Ethel; & then went; V. saying, very calmly, that the majority agreed with me in thinking the D. Island a bad book. And I dont lose any of my liking for her gentleness, truthfulness, modesty. Ly S. has bought Long B. for Â£8,ooo.
