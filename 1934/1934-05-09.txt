### Wednesday 9 May

This the 9th of May was our last day, & fine. So we saw Warwickshireâ€”but Iâ€™ve been reading the Monologue & note how oddly another style infectsâ€”at its best: thick green, thick leaves, stubby yellow stone houses, & a fine sprinkling of Elizabethan cottages. All this led very harmoniously to Stratford on Avon; & all crabbers be damnedâ€”it is a fine, un self conscious town, mixed, with 18th Century & the rest all standing cheek by jowl. All the flowers were out in Shâ akespeaâ reâ€™s garden. â€œThat was where his study windows looked out when he wrote the Tempestâ€ said the man. And perhaps it was true. Anyhow it was a great big house, looking straight at the large windows & the grey stone of the school chapel, & when the clock struck, that was the sound Shre heard. I cannot without more labour than my roadrunning mind can compass describe the queer impression of sunny impersonality. Yes, everything seemed to say, this was Shakespeareâ€™s, had he sat & walked; but you wont find me not exactly in the flesh. He is serenely absent-present; both at once; radiating round one; yes; in the flowers, in the old hall, in the garden; but never to be pinned down. And we went to the Church, & there was the florid foolish bust, but what I had not reckoned for was the worn simple slab, turned the wrong way, Kind Friend for Jesusâ€™ sake forbearâ€”again he seemed to be all air & sun smiling serenely; & yet down there one foot from me lay the little bones that had spread over the world this vast illumination. Yes, & then we walked round the church, & all is simple & a little worn; the river slipping past the stone wall, with a red breadth in it from some flowering tree, & the edge of the turf unspoilt, soft & green & muddy, & two casual nonchalant swans. The church & the school & the house are all roomy spacious places, resonant, sunny today, & in & out illegibleâ€”yes, an impressive place; still living, & then the little bones lying there, which have created: to think of writing The Tempest looking out on that garden; what a rage & storm of thought to have gone over any mind; no doubt the solidity of the place was comfortable. No doubt he saw the cellars with serenity. And a few scented American girls, & a good deal of parrot prattle from old gramophone discs at the birthplace, one taking up the story from the other. But isnt it odd, the caretaker at New Place agreed, that only one genuine signature of S.â€™s is known; & all the rest, books, furniture pictures &c has completely vanished? Now I think Shre was very happy in this, that there was no impediment of fame, but his genius flowed out of him, & is still there, in Stratford. They were acting As you like it I think in the theatre. Duffers the biographers not to make more hum & melody out of New Place. I could, so I think. For the man told us that after the great grand daughterâ€™s death there was a sale, & why shouldnâ€™t some of his things he said, be lost, put away & come to light? Also, Queen H. Maria, Charles the 1stâ€™s Queen stayed there at New Place with the grand daughter (?) which shows how substantial it must have been. That he told us, & I had never heard. And he said Gastrell, the clergyman had the original house, wh. stretched across the garden almost to the chapel, pulled down because people bothered him, asking to see Shreâ€™s house. And there (between the window & the wall) was the room he died in. A mulberry reputes to be the scion of the tree that grew outside Shreâ€™s window. Great cushions of blue yellow white flowers in the garden, which is open, so that the living go on walking & sitting there.
