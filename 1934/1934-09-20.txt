### Thursday 20 September

But then, next day, today which is Thursday, one week later, the other thing begins to workâ€”the exalted sense of being above time & death which comes from being again in a writing mood. And this is not an illusion, so far as I can tell. Certainly I have a strong sense that Roger would be all on oneâ€™s side in this excitement, & that whatever the invisible force does, we thus get outside it. A nice letter from Helen. And today we go to Worthingâ€”dear me, that poor old very superficial content with the outsides & shows of things woman. Who never grasps anything but lives like a butterfly unable to retain or reflect; but abundant genuine of its kind unreflecting feeling. I shall have to hear all her sorrows, & â€˜cheerâ€™ her up: which happens quite easily. A cake, a complimentâ€”chatter.

As a matter of fact she was unexpectedly sensible & rather sympathetic about Roger. She said how terrified she had been when she came to see me first at Bâ k Sqreâ€”how she had been impressed by my tapestriesâ€”had never seen such stuff.
