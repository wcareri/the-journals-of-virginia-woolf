### Saturday 28 July

ah hahâ€”but now, having despatched that entirely disagreeable day, Worthing, & Mr Fears, representing Rodmell Labour party for an hour after dinner, Iâ€™m free to begin the last chapter; & by a merciful Providence the well is full, ideas are rising, & if I can keep at it widely freely powerfully I shall have 2 months of complete immersion. Odd how the creative power at once brings the whole universe to order. I can see the day whole, proportionedâ€”even after a long flutter of the brain such as Iâ€™ve had this morningâ â€”it must be a physical, moral, mental necessity, like setting the engine off. A wild windy hot dayâ€”a tearing wind in the garden; all the July apples on the grass. Iâ€™m going to indulge in a series of quick sharp contrasts: breaking my bondsâ  as much as ever I like. Trying every kind of experiment. Now of course I cant write diary or letters or read because I am making up all the time. Perhaps Bob T. was right in his poem when he called me fortunate above allâ€”I mean in having a mind that can expressâ€”no, I mean in having mobilised my beingâ€”learnt to give it complete, not ju outcomeâ€”I mean, that I have to some extent forced myself to break every mould & find a fresh form of being, that is of expression, for everything I feel & think. So that when it is working I get the sense of being fully energisedâ€”nothing stunted. But this needs constant effort, anxiety & risk. Here in H. & N. I am breaking the mould made by The Waves.
