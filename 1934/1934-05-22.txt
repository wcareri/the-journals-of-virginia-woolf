### Tuesday 22 May

At last today, which is Tuesday, after striking the match on the box despairingly, sterilely,â€”oh I was so overcome with rigidity & nothingnessâ€”a little flame has come. Perhaps Iâ€™m off. This refers to the devilish difficulty of starting Part 7 again after the flu. Elvira & George, or John, talking in her room. Iâ€™m still miles outside them, but I think I got into the right tone of voice this morning. I make this note by way of warning. What is important now is to go very slowly; to stop in the middle of the flood; never to press on; to lie back & let the soft subconscious world become populous; not to be urging foam from my lips. Thereâ€™s no hurry. Iâ€™ve enough money to last a year. If this book comes out next June year its time enough. The last chapters must be so rich, so resuming, so weaving together that I can only go on by letting my mind brood every morning on the whole book. Theres no longer any need to forge ahead, as the narrative part is over. What I want is to enrich & stabilise. This last chapter must equal in length importance & volume the first book; & must in fact give the other side, the submerged side of that. I shant, I think, re-read; I shall summon it backâ€”the teaparty, the death, Oxford & so on, from my memory. And as the whole book depends on bringing this off, I must be very leisurely & patient, & nurse my rather creaking head & dandle it with French & so on as cunningly as possible. We go back this afternoon, & the summer lap therefore now begins in earnest; Mabel &c.

Out of sheer white mist we drove to Charleston last night & my numbed torpor became slightly incandescent. Benita there. Clive Nessa Duncan Quentin all talking at once about Spencerâ€™s pictures.
