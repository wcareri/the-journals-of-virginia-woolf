### Friday 6 July

Being unable to continue the P.s this morning, having indeed worked out that particular vein after 5 weeks writing I suppose, I went out & bought a pen with which I write, a Swan pen, on a broiling hot day, a real scorcher. And came in & found a letter from Stephen Spender praising The Lighthouse, & was made by that to think, have I written myself out, & so read the last chapter of H. & N. disconsolatelyâ€”what a silly thing to do, since, as Iâ€™ve just said, Iâ€™m out of that mood. We go to Rodmell this burning afternoon, & yesterday we were at Reigate, being tried for the inconsiderate act of passing the cyclist. A great red municipal building: sunburnt country gents one wreathed with a gold chain on the bench: L. stood in the box. 3 pounds I heard them whisper, & so it was. The old gents had made up their minds long before that. No I dont like this pen.
