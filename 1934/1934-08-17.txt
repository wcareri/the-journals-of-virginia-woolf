### Friday 17 August

Yes. I think owing to the sudden rush of 2 wakeful nights, making up early mornings rather, I think I see the end of Here & Now (or Music, or Dawn or whatever I shall call it). Its to end with Elvira going out of the house & saying What did I make this knot in my handkerchief for? & all the coppers rolling aboutâ€”â€”

Its to be all in speechesâ€”no playâ€”â€”I have now made a sketch of what everyone is to say; & it ends with a supper party in the downstairs room. I think the back is broken. It will run to something like 850 of my rough pages I imagine: which is at 200: & I shall sweat it down to 130,000.

The boat came yesterday & Julian & I walloped about on the river. An expensive sailâ€”Â£7.7.6 to be exact. Thats what comes of saying lightly Iâ€™d like a boat. But never mind. I have Georgeâ€™s legacy, & even if H. & N. cant be published till Oct. year, still I have Â£1000 or thereabouts saved.

Mabel, called now The Cow, is stiff with neuritis & very â€˜lowâ€™ as she calls it. A very sociable summer this. I have not entered High Salvington: seeing the down made into Putney & a pneumatic drill at work; & the scented room; & Ada like a double guinea pig, pale hair en brosse; going over the windmillâ€”such a drive & such a visit as branded itself like a new cheap villa on my brain.

But I am thinking of H. & N. & it is lunch time.
