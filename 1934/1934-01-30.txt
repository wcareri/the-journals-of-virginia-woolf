### Tuesday 30 January

At this moment, 5 to 4, Ethel Smyth is about to visit Leonard on business, her infringement of the Pankhurst copyright I imagine; therefore I sit down here till 4.30 in order to escape. We have Tom & Tommie dining; & I am going to say I shall call you Stephen. Rather a rush of people; & a dinner to meet Noel Coward at Sybylâ€™s on a cold foggy night. Nessa painting me again. Christmas mercifully over. Nessa very hard up. Question how to make money. Talk of some caricatures, issued between us. Rather an old wives talk. Children, money, education, ways of life; I with my curious penetration playing tentatively round her mood, & afraid to impose my own.

Yesterday I went to Shapland about my watch bracelet, L.â€™s birthday present; came back; sat; talked; Julian came to tea; read Youngâ€™s French travels: rather headachy; sleepy; strange trances in which I make up the last sentence read; to bed; sleep. Today, writing Here & Now, longing to end the Raid Scene, which draws outâ€”hence my headache; then I shall palter with something: lunch with L.: went to Danish Laundry about his collars. A nice frank spoken woman. Collars may have, got among the white stuff. Women ironing. Back room with more women standing. Coppers I daresay downstairs. Looked at flats, L. home to print, I to wander to the Law Courts. Bevir Case being tried. Penetrated from end to end. Judges Chambers: a kind of vault. Kings Bench; &c. People scurrying; my sense of guilt at having no business there. So to bus; home, & found my bracelet.
