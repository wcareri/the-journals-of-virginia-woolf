Waterville

Too like its name; blowing the spray & the rain over a flat land, & a scattering of hideous 1850 watering place houses. Mist today, wind tonight; & L. opening the first Times to come our way, said George Duckworth is dead. So he is. And I feel the usual incongruous shades of feeling, one from this year, one from thatâ€”how great a part he used to play & now scarcely any. But I remember the genuine glow, from last summer when I went to see himâ€”the thing that always made me laugh & yet was marked in him. But how little he meant, after his marriageâ€”& yet how childhood goes with himâ€”the batting, the laughter, the treats, the presents, taking us for bus rides to see famous churches, giving us tea at City Inns, & so onâ€”that was the best which oddly enough returned of late years a little, with the Lincoln sausages, the bottles of eau de Cologne, the great bunch of flowers. Margaret I remember playing round him, & I thought how happy in their way they were. But this is all happening far off. Here I sit on my bed in the windy seaside hotel, & wait for dinner, with this usual sense of time shifting & life becoming unreal, so soon to vanish while the world will go on millions upon millions of years.
