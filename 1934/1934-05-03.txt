Theyre looking out names on maps at this moment. â€œThat gives us a very good idea ofâ€¦. What I wd suggest if I mightâ€”tomorrow on the wayâ€”weâ€™re coming down from Killarney tomorrowâ€”then another thing, wd you like to go to Glengarrifâ€”â€ (they are 4 fattish unattractive but kindly womenâ€”wont take our fire, weâ€™re sitting in the hotel lounge after a long day driving & I certainly canâ€™t read Proust with such a patter going on. We have a roasting great fire. Listen, I thought youâ€™d made up your mind to do this part firstâ€”well then tomorrow.

Listenâ€”wd this be too much of aâ€”I dont want to break the springs of that car. Thats another ideaâ€”weâ€™re going West.

To copy down conversation is not very interesting. People say the same thing over & over again. I wd like to describe the perfection of Irish conversation, which was Mrs FitzGeraldâ€™s last night. She is exactly the great French ladyâ€”only living in a black jersey on an Irish bog. After dinner she came in, ostensibly to lend us a paper & offer advice, in fact to indulge her genius for talk. She talked till 11, & wd. willingly be talking now: about hotel keeping, about frigidaires, about her grandmother sitting on a chair in the kitchen & saying Thats done that wants another 2 minutes & so on, never stirring herself but somehow getting it done. We have the name of being good housekeepers. Then on about bogs, she has bought several fragments because now there may be money in it. However I can give no notion of the flowing, yet formed sentences, the richness & ease of the language; the lay out, dexterity & adroitness of the arrangement. There was the story of old Julia the cook, who had gone off home in a huff jealous of the young maids; had her daughter & the London husband on her, bought them gramophone records, & now wont own that she has wasted her savings. Mrs F. is one of those bluntnosed parted haired Irishwomen with luminous brown eyes & something sardonic & secretive in her expression. Talk is to her an intoxicant, but there is as Mr Rowlands said, something heartless about the Iâ rish: quite cold indifferent sarcastic, for all their melody, their fluency, their adorable ease & forthcomingness. She was very much on the spot, accurate, managing, shrewd, hard headed, analytic. Why arent these people the greatest novelists in the world?â€”with this facility, this balance, this fundamental (now L. has joined in & is advising the 3 ladies. Are they American?)

Its very kind of you telling us: thank you very much. Now the wireless is brawling. Everything looks nice in fine weather. I think Iâ€™ll go to bed. I want you to read this. One is the director of the others, severe, but apologetic, perhaps paid for.

But why isnâ€™t Mrs F. a great novelist? Certainly the salon survives at Glenbeith, the lust for talk, & finishing oneâ€™s sentenceâ€”only with complete naturalness. For instance, explaining the bogs, â€œsaturated, now whats the opposite word?â€ Desiccated, L. suggested, & she adopted it with pleasure. She said one could never understand the Irish: one had to live as they did. They sit in their cottages talking about politics; they dont dance much; they have no amusements. They at once started to poach on her bog merely because she had bought itâ€”otherwise it had been left alone for centuries. The bogs are full of trees, cant be self planted, so orderly, but now who has planted them? And they burn in a resinous wayâ€”go upâ€”puf!â€”in a flash, like petrol. Suddenly she became severe & thought me a fool. â€œWhat does this good lady mean?â€ Her grandmother was an innkeeper; she herself went away for 25 years; Oh, as my grandmother said, one becomes able to read peoples characters before they step over the door, & ones never wrong one way or the other. Her quickness was amazing. This morning the talk began & L. very slightly put out his hand. â€œOh I know that means you wanting to be offâ€â€”& so we parted from the last representative of the French salon of the 18th Century, this strange mixture of county lady, peasant, & landlady.

Oh but the Irish loudspeaker is inferior like everything else in this down trodden land. Things cant be worse, said the one armed manâ€”his artificial arm wore a black woollen gloveâ€”who warned us off the river walk, & then showed us the full horror of Dunraven Castle, built from 1835 to 1850 like the rest of Ireland, a French ChÃ¢teau in grey stone costing a million, & better razed to the ground.

Nessa writes that George before he died wanted Nessa & me to wire to himâ€”which she did. What was in his mind? some old memory? some regret? I wonder.
