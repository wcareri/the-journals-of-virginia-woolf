### Tuesday 8 May

Worcester

We finished up Dublin in grand style yesterday. On the windy, indeed roaring windy Sunday we walked through Phoenix Park, where a crowdâ€”this marks their lack of entertainmentâ€”watched a school of small girls playing hockey: had tea at Leixlip, pronounced Leeslip, an 18th century bare parlour, nice woman who had a child ill, & had been having a guest from Manitoba who said she was descended from the Kingsâ€”& then off we went down a leafy country laneâ€”but the trees were lashing & one great bough fallen across the roadâ€”to Celbridge, where the famous interview with the blue eyesâ€”I forget the phraseâ€”took place. A girl said the Abbey was the big house down the road. It is a thick grey sham Gothic Abbey, but weathered now to look ancient, with sham Cathedral windows bricked up, & a great garden, all trees & bowers perhaps, leading down to the river. That was where she sat then; & she died here. But we could not see into the garden from the bank, & so drove home again.

The next day which was oddly enough, yesterday, for now time & the Channel have cut off Ireland, and here in Worcester, the ancient, rich, traditional, all that shifty poverty seems blotted outâ€”yesterday we went first to the Nat Gall, of which I say nothingâ€”the pictures are very highly cleanedâ€”& then to St Patrickâ€™s, where, over the door are the tremendous words; & in front of the door a diamond shaped brass, to mark the deanâ€™s tomb. There beside him till a few years ago slept Stella; but the late Bishop, as the verger sarcastically remarked, pointing to his name opprobriously on the long list, decided that she was buried at some distance, & so moved her brass plate. I suspect this was prudery; & if Swift was buried in her grave, that seems to amount to marriage. Also her epitaph which he wrote, alludes to her being celebrated by him. However the Bishop moved themâ€”& in prudery also Lord Guiness has cased all the old pillars of Irish marble in stucco, so that they look like South Kensington, & somebody else, of equal piety, has floored the whole building with black & red tiles such as there are in hotelsâ€”much to the dudgeon of the old verger, who, like everybody else, regretted the old days: showed us the stalls of the Knights of St Patrick, with their helmets & arms, one the Prince of Walesâ€™s another the Duke of Connaughtâ€™s â€œbut they dont come here nowâ€â€” He too, like the shopkeepers & hotel keepers would gladly have done with the President of the Free State. â€œWe dont want this hateâ€”it does nobody any goodâ€ as the porter at Holyhead said to me this morning when he remarked how few cattle now came over. And at breakfastâ€”the best I have ever eaten, because the coffee was goodâ€”I said to L. all the people themselves are sensible. Whats come over the politicians? And this we debated, & then took to the road in the wet & cold & drove in a downpour through Wales, through Shrewsbury (disappointing) through Much Wenlock (good) & much green & prosperous country, till we reached Worcester & took up lodging for the last time at the Star. L. told me not to stare so at the other tea drinkers, but I find it difficult not to gaze at these real English, these dwellers in the very heart of the land, who talk of horses & games all the time, & meet their men friends in the lounge, & sit drinking & laughing & bandying county gossip under pictures of famous race horses. Horses rule England, as salmon rule Ireland. In every hotel in Ireland sits a military man with poached egg eyes & sandy hair, a loud commanding voice, & spongebag coat & red slippers, after a dayâ€™s fishing. There he sits & drinks; & all day he fishesâ€”landing salmon after salmon, if its at Galway, so that they lie along the bank, to the wonder of the intellectual German lawyer, whom we met again there. He told us he saw them fishing all day, & a day costs Â£2, & they must give back half the fish they catch, & so much on every fish caught to the man with the gaff. He marvelled. And thats what Ireland is kept for: in every place where thereâ€™s a river is built a large Inn, with town cooking & hot water & ladies & gentlemenâ€™s lavatories, though thereâ€™s nothing but bog & hill for miles around, & there in the lounge the majors sit, & pay for the fishing, while the natives talk & talk & talkâ€”about the old Kings of Ireland, presumably. Not that their folk lore is very interesting, Thompson said. An odd division of the country.

And here we are amidst the wealth of Worcester. Richer than ever it seemsâ€”this Cathedral city, set in the centre of ancient glovemaking & porcelain making, of Queen Annâ e guildhalls, with a girdle of the usual 18th Century ecclesiastical houses, indeed in Much Wenlock there is more ancient stone & carving & architecture to be seen than in the whole of Ireland.

We are very tired of hotels & glad that this is our last night, though the comfort is extreme.
