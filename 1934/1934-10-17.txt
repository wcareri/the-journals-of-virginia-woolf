### Wednesday 17 October

I am so sleepy. Is this age? I cant shake it off. And so gloomy. Thats the end of the book. I looked up past diariesâ€”a reason for keeping themâ€”& found the same misery after Waves. After Lighthouse I was I remember nearer suicide, seriously, than since 1913. It is after all natural. Iâ€™ve been galloping now for 3 monthsâ€”so excited I made a plunge at my paper-well, cut that all offâ€”after the first divine relief, of course some terrible blankness must spread. Thereâ€™s nothing left of the people, of the ideas, of the strain, of the whole life in short that has been racing round my brain: not only the brain; it has seized hold of my leasure: think how I used to sit still on the same railway lines: running on my book. Well, so theres nothing to be done the next 2 or 3 or even 4 weeks but dandle oneself: refuse to face it: refuse to think about it. This time Roger makes it harder than usual. We had tea with Nessa yesterday. Yes, his death is worse than Lyttonâ€™s. Why I wonder? Such a blank wall. Such a silence. Such a poverty. How he reverberated! And I feel it through Nessa.

But selfishly, I cant throw it off as I did the first week after his death; when it became all the colours of the setting sun, in my excitement. Now theres the dulness, the cold to face & no protection. And so W.L. had the power to sting. No thats over. Only I cant get up any steam. Iâ€™m so ugly. So old. No one writes to me. Iâ€™mâ€¦. Well: dont think about it, & walk all over London; & see people. & imagine their lives. I cant read seriously. I feel so drowsy, as if my brain were dilated: cant contract: then I suddenly lapse into sleep.

Margery is going, Nessa thinks, to ask me to write about Roger. I dont feel ready to. I dread the plunge into the past. I slog away at Romance & biography of a morning.

I would like to write down more actual conversation; but its such hard work. With Nessa & Duncan at tea:

V. Roger.. well everybody he met felt like that about him. He got very restless in the last year or two. He was always jumping up to show one something. Clive made me very angry at Charlestonâ€”He abused Rogerâ€”really for the criticism in his article. He was jealous. Yes. I think it is right to have livesâ€”What a pity that it should all be lost. Peoples impressions are good. Besides, someone will be certain to write about Rogerâ€”so it had better be by us.

Duncan. I liked Priestleyâ€™s play tho Iâ€™m told all his novels are very bad. He is very dramatic. He knows howâ€”I meanâ€”(D. always against public opinionâ€”lying on the sofaâ€”has had a cold).

Then Morgan, after tea, about the meeting of the Civil Liberties tomorrow.

M. I hadnt thought of that. Iâ€™m dreadfully ignorant. So Leonard you would sayâ€”may I have a piece of paper? Yes, then: the point isâ€”I will say â€¦
