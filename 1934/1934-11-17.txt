### Saturday 17 November

A note: despair at the badness of the book: cant think how I ever could write such stuffâ€”& with such excitement: thats yesterday: today I think it good again. A note, by way of advising other Virginias with other books that this is the way of the thing: up down, up downâ€”& Lord knows the truth.
