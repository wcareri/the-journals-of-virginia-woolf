### Tuesday 21 August

Having taken a week off, in the middle of the last scene, which is indeed like a scene in a play, I am too jaded to write that horrid book, I mean Fiction, this morningâ€”

Last night the ice was hard, & we decided that Mabel must go. She is a dump. She wears her shoes on one side, & has long black stockings. Also there was a hot violent gale. It was a bad day of its kind, & I dreamt ferociously all night; about Massine; & Wilmington, & woke with all my back in hackles, like a cats, & the old cry Fight: upon wh L. opened the door; no letters; only burnt breadâ€”& so I had Â½ an hour in the kitchen which is crumby, with Mabel, & now I cant think: I shall moon the day away. This is what comes of driving ahead at that last chapter. It is very concentrated. I read Une Vie last night, & it seemed to me rather marking time & wateryâ€”heaven help meâ€”in comparison. Its the change of gear that so upsetting Like a smash in a car; being spilt from one world to the other.

I shall go in & get a book & my watch & moon away the morning & pray for a good dinner. The week end will be intolerable. Plomer & Lyn, neither of whom do I wish to see. We are using the new room for the first time.

The lesson of Here & Now is that one can use all kinds of â€˜formsâ€™ in one book. Therefore the next might be poem, reality, comedy, play: narrative; psychology, all in one. Very short. This needs thinking over.

Also, a play about the Parnells,  
or a biography of Mrs. P.
