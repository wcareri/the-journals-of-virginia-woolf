These are very sensible sayings I think. And its all forgotten & overâ€”

What is uppermost now, is (1) The question of writing R.â€™s life. Helen came. Says both she & Mâ . wish it. So I wait. What do I feel about it? If I could be free, then hereâ€™s the chance of trying biography: a splendid, difficult chanceâ€”better than trying to find a subjectâ€”that is, if I am free. But M. hesitates: I have heard nothing from her; & rather suspect she wants to do it herself.

We were at Monks House in a great flood of rain & storm of wind this week end; which lifted yesterday, & I took my Sunday morning walk with L. & saw the monkey that was found in the Brooks. This great yellow green ape had run all across the down from Peacehavenâ€”a circus monkey wintering with a keeper up there. An odd sight to have met it clambering along over the downs. So I went on, to Piddinghoe, & back by the river. And my brain rose out of the mist (writing about reviewing, I mean) & I felt young & vigorous. Home with the car all acrid & yellow & red with chrysanthemums. And put them in waterâ€”a long jobâ€”& so to hear Sweeney Agonistes at the Group Theatre; an upper attic or studio: I sat by Tom: an audience, containing Ottoline & Hope & Raymond. The acting made more sense than the reading but I doubt that Tom has enough of a body & brain to bring off a whole play: certainly he conveys an emotion, an atmosphere: which is more than most: something peculiar to himself; sordid, emotional, intenseâ€”a kind of Crippen, in a mask: modernity & poetry locked together. I liked the egg speech. Talk with Hope about her thyroid gland & her dachshund: Hope as usual eccentric impulsive ecstatic odd. And there was a mint of notables.
