### Sunday 30 December

Since I forgot to bring my writing book, I must fill up here, on loose sheets. End the year; with those cursed dogs barking: & I am sitting in my new house; & it is, of all hours, 3.10; & it is raining; & the Cow has the sciatica; & we are taking her into Lewes to catch a train to London; after which we have tea at Charleston, act the play & dine there. It has been the wettest Christmas, I should say, drawing a bow at a venture, on record. Only yesterday did I manage my phantom farm walk; but pray God, with Christmas over, the rain will stop falling, Miss Emeryâ€™s dogs barking.

It was stupid to come without a book, seeing that I end every morning with a head full of ideas about The Pargiters. It is very interesting to write out. I am re-writing considerably. My idea is to space contrast the scenes; very intense, less so: then drama; then narrative. Keeping a kind of swing & rhythm through them all. Anyhow it admits of great varietyâ€”this book.

I think it shall be called Ordinary People. I finished, more or less, Maggie & Sarah, the first scene, in the bedroom: with what excitement I wrote it! And now hardly a line of the original is left. Yes but the spirit is caught I think. I write perhaps 60 pages before I catch that. And coming back I see it hopping like a yellow canary on its perch. I want to make both S. & M. bold characters, using character dialogue. Then we go on to Martinâ€™s visit to Eleanor: then the long day that ends with the Kingâ€™s death. I have sweated off 80 or 90 pages, mostly due to a fault in paging though.

End of the year: & Francis transacting his death at that nursing home in Collingham Place. The expression on his face is what I see: as if he were facing a peculiar lonely sorrow. Oneâ€™s own deathâ€”think of lying there alone, looking at it, at 45 or so: with a great desire to live. â€œAnd so the New Statesmanâ€™s going to be the best paper that ever was, is it?â€ Heâ€™s dead though (of Brimley Johnson) spoken with a kind of bitterness. None of these words are exactly right.

And here we are, chafed by the Cowâ€™s lame leg & the dogs: yet as usual very happy I think: ever so full of ideas. L. finishing his Quack Quack of a morning: the Zet crawling from one chair to the otherâ€”picking at L.â€™s head.

And Roger dead. And am I to write about him? And the stirring of the embersâ€”I mean the wish to make up as much of a fire as possible. So to get ready for the wet driveâ€”dogs still barking.
