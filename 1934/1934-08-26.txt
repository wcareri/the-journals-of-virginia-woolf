### Sunday 26 August

Plomer & Lyn are talking outside the window. They are sitting in the walled garden, on the chairs we bought yesterday. We have left them there to read. We have supplied them with Ethelâ€™s books, with Blind men cross the Bridgeâ€”an immense long totally absurd (work of genius the Lit Sup calls it) novel; but now they have ceased readingâ€”indeed it is rather windyâ€”& are talking. I catch only a word now & then. Lyn has just said that she â€œimmensely enjoyed itâ€. What, I wonder?! doubt that she immensely enjoys anything. She is rather faded & suppressed & literal & conscientious wearing her horn spectacles & frowning. William I think (but L. disagrees) rather aged & disillusioned. But, against my forecast, I am enjoying the week end. For one thing the cooking has been good; Mabel â€˜a treasureâ€™. With Louie to help we live in greater comfort than any time these 5 years. Ethel came over to tea yesterday and did her owlâ€”who is a red wattled turkey cockâ€”very vigorously. In fact she adds considerably to the entertainment of the week end. We sat & bawled, about God & Dulwich. She only had time for half a remark about the Prison & her complete lack of ambition.

Thursday was a horrid day though, when we took Julian Angelica & Susan to London, on a windy day; & I had toothache & went to the dentist, & he says I must have 2 teeth out; & everything went as a nightmareâ€”ending, after a bitter cold drive with a most depressing view of family life at Charleston, which I arranged into a climax of domesticity & was thoroughly irritated with Duncan for making Nessa into Aunt Maryâ€”cant come here, cant go to London as long as he is ill; & with Nessa for her passive submission; & with myself for being the good fairy Aunt. Lord how that role can bore meâ€”how unreal it isâ€”& why do I act it? These were my thoughts, soothed mercifully after dinner alone by Leonard.
