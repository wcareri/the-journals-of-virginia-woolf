### Wednesday 31 October

Too tired after dining with Helen last night & talking too much with Oliver about Roger & Bâ loomsburyâ€”too tired to write. And must dine with Clive to meet Aldous & the Clarks. What a life I could have led if I had been born with full rich blood to my head. As it is, one late night floors me; all sand this morning. We talked too much, I think. And I sat in Rogerâ€™s chair, & thought once he was thereâ€”Oliverâ€™s shoes like his. The room diminished slightly: not so rich & sonorous. Baba an ill favoured, rough mouthed girl. And Oliverâ€™s mistressâ€”dear me, why mistress? Sickert I rather gather a failure: silence descends on that little flurry.

Now to read Jane Austenâ€™s Thomsonâ€™s Seasons.

Helen by the way asked me tentatively to write Rogerâ€™s Life. Julian to collect all facts, make a skeleton; I to sum & compose. But Margery wants to write it. Margery has the documents: is executor. I deferred. Isnt a â€˜Lifeâ€™ impossible? Yes, said Oliver. All sorts of people shd put down recollections. And unprintable. So whats to come of it? I deferred, (what exactly does that word mean?)
