Ideas that came to me last night dining with Clive; talking to Aldous & the Kenneth Clarks.

About Rogerâ€™s life: that it should be written by different people to illustrate different stages.

Youth. by Margery  
Cambridge, by Wedd?

Early London life â€¦  
Post Imp. - Clive Sickert.

Bloomsbury, - Desmond, V.W.

Later life. â€“ Julian, Blunt., Heard. & so on.  
all to be combined say by Desmond & me together.

About novels: the different strata of being: the upper underâ€”This is a familiar idea, partly tried in The Pargiters. But I think of working it out more closely; & now, particularly, in my critical book: showing how the mind naturally follows that order in thinking: how it is illustrated by literature.

I must now do biography & autobiography.

Talk at dinner about: Yeats; Noel Coward; the plates: Clarks cant use theirs: the hostesses: Sibyl & Emerald. Ly Câ . says Aldous indecent: wears a false bust: their collection like playing cards; had dined & sat next Lady P. Smith; a bore; the other woman a hump back; Coward at Monte Carlo, laying his hand on A.â€™s arm: this this is divineâ€”a Jazz like the rest. The variety of his gifts: but all out of the 6d box at Woolworthâ€™s. Beating & beating & beatingâ€”an omelette without eggs, said A. Nothing there: but the heroic beating. Talk about the Occult: A. cant stand Auden. Nothing but a demagogue. Declaims: takes in the young. Something in Day Lewisâ€”hasnt read Spender.
