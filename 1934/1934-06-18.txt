### Monday 18 June

Very very hot; day altered so as to go out after tea. A drought over the world. In flood with Here & Now, praise be. Yetâ€”very wary; only just now I made up the scene with Renny & Maggie: a sign I am fertilising, for I should be doing French for Janie, who comes at 5. Yes, & last night we sat in Gordon Sqre with Mary Bakerâ€”a timid housemaid little body, no birth or breeding, but 2 dogs; lizards on her terrace, & scorpions, which dont bite with their claws, but punch you & then bite; she had seen one, placed in a ring of fire commit suicide; very very hot it was, the Stracheys calling through the railings to be let in. Then James & Alix, all praising that scramble & scream of a party which I hated so: rather shocked that Nessa enjoyed it. So many young screaming drunks. Well, perhaps at 2 in the morningâ€¦. I forgot we had Aldous: a most admirable, cool, antiseptic distempered, but humane & gentle man: with age just tempering his brow: experience; but admirably mature, as we are not; has gone about the world, completely sceptical, all the more humane; judging everything, yet nothing. A little theoretical, about religion & sex; not for that reason a novelist; infinitely elongated & bony: his blurred grey eye; his malice & wit; talked of Sullivan, of Ottoline; Brett; then of the French noblesse; how he visits them; and they come down, amazed to find a VC: & he had spent a weekend at Welwyn with the Sex Reformers; taken off his clothes among the cabbages & read Waste Land. Necessary to say penis & fuck; but that said, no change follows. He uses every instant to the best advantage but has somehow solved the problem of remaining just, gentle,â€”a very sympathetic mind, & Iâ€™m glad I troubled to write to himâ€”one of my rare fruitful actions; not to let things slip so much, to which I owe Aldousâ€™s visit, & we are to meet in the autumn.
