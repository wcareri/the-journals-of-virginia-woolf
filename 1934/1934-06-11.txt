### Monday 11 June

That hopeful page reads rather too credulous now, since I went back & again on Friday following shivered, & ached, was stiff as a rod, talking to Elizabeth Bowen: 101: bed: influenza: & so lay all that week, till last Sunday to be accurate; & then went to Rodmell; & there began the chapter again, & had a sudden fuse of ideas & then there was the opera, the nightingale singing in the ilex tree, Christabel & Mr Olaf Hambro telling stories about the Queen & Prince; & a very hot concert yesterday, so I cannot, no I cannot write today. Patience, as Carlyle wd. say (in Italian). But considerâ€”the whole system is so strained over this end, that one tiny grit, one late night, one too tiring dayâ€”takes away all rush, all fusing. And just as I saw it clear before me: the very intricate scenes: all contrasting; building up: so wait till tomorrow.
