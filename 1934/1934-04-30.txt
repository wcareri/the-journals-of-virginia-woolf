### Monday 30 April

Glengariff

This is the 30th of April, Monday, so I think, foreign travel not leading to thought. A mixture of Greece, Italy & Cornwall; great loneliness; poverty & dreary villages like squares cut out of West Kensington. Not a single villa or house a-building; great stretches of virgin sea shore; the original land that Cornwall & much of England was in Elizabethan times. And a sense that life is receding. At Lismore the Tchekov innkeeper said Theyre all going away & leaving their houses; nothingâ€™s kept up since the war. So the old man on the island here said todayâ€”the very sad gentle old man who longed to talk. All goneâ€”What good did the war do anyone? Only the Americans. And crooned & moaned leaning on the rake with which he was heaping up somekind of weed. Yes there is great melancholy in a deserted land, though the beauty remains untouchedâ€”miles & miles of Killarneyâ€”the lake water lapping the stones, the butterflies flitting, & not a Cockney there. Today, sitting on the verandah after lunch, the German lawyer having been forced to go to the Islandâ€”a string of touts loaf about pressing poetry & boats on oneâ€”after they had gone, the invalid, who reminds me of Nelly Cecil began to talk as they all begin to talk; & said she came from Limerick & when we asked if one could get a house there, she saidâ€”she laughed a great deal yet seems hopelessly crippledâ€”â€œYou can get plenty, but its not so nice when you have one.â€ â€œServant difficulties?â€ I asked. â€œAh, all thatâ€ she said, & one can see, after Bowenâ€™s Court, how ramshackle & half squalid the Irish life is, how empty & poverty stricken. There we spent one night, unfortunately with baboon Conolly & his gollywog slug wife Jean to bring in the roar of the Chelsea omnibus, & it was all as it should beâ€”pompous & pretentious & imitative & ruinedâ€”a great barrack of grey stone, 4 storeys & basements, like a town house, high empty rooms, & a scattering of Italian plaster-work, marble mantelpieces, inlaid with brass & so on. All the furniture clumsy solid cut out of single woodâ€”the wake sofa, on wh. the dead layâ€”carpets shrunk in the great rooms, tattered farm girls waiting, the old man of 90 in his cabin who wdnâ€™t let us goâ€”Eâ lizabeth had to say Yes The Ladies are very well several times. And we went to the wishing well, where there are broken cups as offerings & half a rosary & L. wished that Pinka might not smell, which made me laugh; & then I talked to the cook, & she showed me the wheel for blowing the fire in the windy pompous kitchen, half undergroundâ€”rather like the Bride of Lammermuirâ€”Caleb showing the guests nothingâ€”no there was a fine turkey but everywhere desolation & pretention cracked grand pianos, faked old portraits, stained wallsâ€”& yet with character & charm, looking on to a meadow where the trees stand in a ring called Lambâ€™s Cradle. Talk too much of: the Chelsea bar kind, owing to C.â€™sâ€”about starting a society called Bostocks, about Ireland with Alan, a good humoured bolt eyed fat hospitable man. So on here over the mountains. And pray God the C.â€™s dont show their gorilla faces at dinner or invade the old Squires library in which we sit.
