### Monday 19 March

I cannot describe how the Nelly situation weighs on my spirits. I am determined not to discuss it with L. either. She pressed me this morning. You show no confidence in me; you dont treat me like a maid. Oh dearâ€”how tempted I was then to say Then go; but I bit my tongue. And then down here, trying to make it up. I couldnâ€™t imagine it would be so hard & the worst to come. On the top of it this hammering painting, ordering of books. And I cant get into flood therefore with H. & N., though I had I think rather a brilliant flash this morning how to compact the rather fluid Eleanor. I shall have a shot anyhow. But Nelly spoils all. And to think none of this need have happened had I stuck to my guns 3 years ago! Now I must & will.

We went to Cambridge on Saturday, lunch with Dadie, Rosamond & Wogan; I ought not to call him that. He is jealous about R.â€™s fame: she not. So to An. & C. & there was Shephard with all the little Eton boys, like the white chaps of a Christmas pig. A dragging weak performance. Lovely drive home in the twilight through the wide unmarked country. To dine with Nessa last night. Clive there. N. all a blowing & aglowing with the success of her show, & the money made. Then in came Lydia, all &c. too, owing to her success; & I felt so old so cold so dumpish, nothing flowery or fiery glowing in me owing to Nelly, but not jealous: I dont think that. Mynd very flown too, & Duncan too, & Clive quiet & now I think of walking round to Ottâ€™s to meet Ly Oxford & if I can change my moodâ€”rather a violent remedy. A clear wet spring sort of day. We went to Drews & bought Cashinâ€™s present, then to L.â€™s hat & tailor; so home. All yesterday I did the dining room books. Today he is finishing the study & they are painting the stairs. Oh for the end of this chapter, for Rodmell & peace & freedom to use my mind again.
