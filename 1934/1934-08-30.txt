### Thursday 30 August

If I cant even write here, owing to making up the last scenes, how can I possibly read Dante? Impossible. After 3 days grind, getting back, I am I think floated again.

Robson comes to tea today; & the Woolves tomorrow; & â€¦ another lapse making up Elâ€™s speech .. â€œDâ€™you know what Iâ€™ve been clasping in my hand all the evening? Coppers.â€

Well anyhow Iâ€™ve enough in stock to last out this Chapter; I daresay another 2 or 3 weeks.

Yesterday I found a new walk, & a new farm, in the fold between Asheham & Tarring Neville. Very lovely, all alone, with the down rising behind. Then I walked back by a rough broad overflowing grey river. The porpoise came up & gulped. It rained. All ugliness was disolved. An incredibly 18th century landscape, happily making me think less of Wilmington.

A tremendous hail storm after tea. Like white ice; broken up: lanced, lashing, like the earth being whipped. This happened several times. Black clouds while we played Brahms.

No letters at all this summer. But there will be many next year, I predict. And I dont mind; the day, yesterday to be exact, being so triumphant: writing: the walk; reading, Leeson, a detective, Saint Simon, Henry Jamesâ€™ preface to P. of a Ladyâ€”very clever, but one or two things I recognise: then Gideâ€™s Journal, again full of startling recollectionâ€”things I cd; have said myself.
