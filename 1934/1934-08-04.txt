### Saturday 4 August

Waiting about to go to Annieâ€™s wedding. No signs yet. No bells ringing. So impossible to do anything, & here I am at 11 this hot August morning in full garden party dress. No news of Frankie. The tap tap of the boys playing cricket reminds me of our cricket sensations. What is the difference between memory, excited by sensation, & thoughtâ€”the thought required by a page of Plato for instance?

Yesterday just as we had done tea, Adrianâ€™s gaunt form appeared; Karinâ€™s touseled shape, grown very thick & large. Her inferiority complex takes the form of praising Adrian. Clever old Adrian, she exclaims, if he bowls a good bowl. This is by way of sayingâ€”what? My marriage was not so bad after all? He remains perfectly unmoved, quiet, sensible; I suppose curiously immature, though able to go through all the actions correctly of a grown man, father, husband.

The night before, Enid Jones rang up & came, from 9.15 to 10.45 to discuss her bookâ€”the effect of winning the Grand National on a child, ostensibly; really another case of inferiority I think; to rub off the taste of Goodwood with Scatters Wilson. Like a dog eating grass. But why shd she need to eat grass? Because, being a scallywag she married a very rich man: is neither fish flesh fowl nor good red herring; & thats an ambiguous state that requires perpetual adjustment. She shifts from self to self. We have to provide a transition. An uneasy woman, rather hard. Brandishes all her children all her responsibilities all her gaieties in our face. Uncertain whether to stay or to go.

Clive & Julian & so on to tea today. I will swear not to pick up one of the thorns so artfully administered by the Pismireâ€”slipped in. George ring the bell & run away. I will carefully observe his method & analyse it in action.

Saxon very glad to come here next week end. We take up a conversation broken these 10 years in our natural voices. What about Pericles? & so on. A relief after Sybilâ€™s histrionics.

Certainly bright leaves do glare as Rupert said. No sign of the wedding yet. I think of the craving of the human being for sympathy.
