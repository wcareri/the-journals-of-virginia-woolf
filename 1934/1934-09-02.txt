### Sunday 2 September

I dont think I have ever been more excited over a book than I am writing the end ofâ€”shall it be Dawn? Or is that too emphatic, sentimental. I wrote like aâ€”forget the wordâ€”yesterday; my cheeks burn; my hands tremble. I am doing the scene where Peggy listens to them talking & bursts out. It was this outburst that excited me so. Too much perhaps. I cant make the transition to Eâ â as speech easily this morning. Another lull; but very slight, caused partly by the great tea table talk yesterdayâ€”9 to tea; Ks. Bâ€™s. Ky Martin & Kahan, the economic Jew, I forget his name. We arranged lots of little cakes on two tables. And some came early, others late. And they talked (as in my book that morning) about Civilisation, owing to L.â€™s article on Shaw, which had, as usual upset Kingsley, even to the extent of making him consider giving up the NS. & taking a professorship. â€œFor whats the use of the NS. if thereâ€™s no future for our civilisation?â€ What use is there for professors in that case? Clive inappropriately tried to flirt with that scrannel woman Olga. A wrung out washerwomanâ€™s hands woman. And Kâ â€”so histrionic, so effusive. Lydia oppressed, I thought, by the death of Cecchetti. And Maynard by his week end party. The men played bowls. The girls, including Mâ€”sat in the upstairs room. But Olga made us restrained.

I am very calm & worldly competent at the moment though. I rather like those made up words. Single words too precise. Annoyed by Duncanâ€™s scareâ€”a temp: must be consumption & so on. Now the specialist says nothing of the kind, as I cd. have told them. Strange to be irritated by this: but I am.
