### Friday 18 May

I broke off, after sticking my Irish papers into the old book, & felt I suppose a little shiver. Cant be anything I said to myself after all that holiday; but it wasâ€”the flue. So I had to resign all ideasâ€”all flood of Pargiters & the glorious & difficult end of that book: all was blotted by the damp sponge; & now it is precisely a week since I went to bed, & here we are for Whitsun at Monks; whats more amazing is that I write this with a gold Waterman, & have some thoughts of supplanting steel Woolworth. It is a sunny voluptuous day, the birds all rasping, on their nests I suppose, & cawing on the trees & early in the morning giving loud & continued bursts of song, to which I lie listening. I hear L. going about the garden with Percy. All is calm & profoundly comfortable, owing to the absence for ever even in the background of grumbling Nelly, & her replacement by the steady silent unselfish Mabel. Yes, we do without a Char; we are free, serene, matter of fact, oh what a relief! So if I can pull my head out of the bog, I may go back on Tuesday to the 3 months immersion. But I take a day or two more to rest myself. How infinitely modest & disillusioned & without ambition of any sort I became, all because of influenza. Couldnt believe that anyone would come & see me, let alone that I could ever again string a dozen words. Now self confidence, conceit, the blessed illusion by which we live begin to return; very gently. Smooth serenity is the first stage which I will not interrupt by writing.
