### Tuesday 16 January

I have let all this timeâ€”3 weeks at Monksâ€”slip because I was there so divinely happy & pressed with ideasâ€”another full flood of Pargiters or Here & Now (odd that Goldieâ€™s letter mentions thatâ€”The Waves is also here & nowâ€”I had forgotten). So I never wrote a word of farewell to the year; not a word describing the Keynes & the Jonesâ€™s; nothing about the walks I had ever so far into the downs; or the readingâ€”Marvell of an evening, & the usual trash. And Clara died; & I sat with Mrs Woolf who said â€œShe asked so little of lifeâ€â€”she crooned it, rather, lying in a daze. Nothing of that has been written; & now we are back again. (And have I a touch of the flue?) What a bore, since I am floating rather rapturously in the Raid scene & dont think that 3 days in bed would be at all useful. No doubt its nothing though.

Vita dined last night, & we discussed Sparrowâ€™s book, she as always generously impartial: never takes sides, or lives in a setâ€”a good example, though without my intensity of feeling (I add immediately to recoup myself). This is rather the style of Here & Now: my random rapid letter writing style. Lyn wants me to write for her; Ethel to lend my screen; that is the worst of oneâ€™s friendsâ€”these little unfair demands that make one turn on the other side in the middle of the night. But it is lunch time. This book, alas, must continue soberly in the same cover as 1933: too wasteful to begin another & leave all this blue paper blank.
