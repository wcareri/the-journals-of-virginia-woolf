### Tuesday 9 October

Back again in London. A party last night: Mary Fisher, Eddie Playfair, Rose Macaulay & Saxon. An odd mixture; but successful. We cried with laughter. This was partly Eddieâ€™s account of Carrie who went round the world with James: who died: & became â€˜the bodyâ€™. Mountains very nice. Everything very nice. This was to prove that character is one & indivisible. Rose maintained the opposite. â€œIâ€™m a mere battlefield of opposite peopleâ€”my ancestorsâ€ she said. â€œTake this as a simple illustration: I want to walk all day alone: but I also want to drive my car. We called it having â€œbattling lizardsâ€.â€ That made us laugh. Saxon & Eddie represented the uniformity of the Treasury. Also we discussed commas: Rose very erudite on that subject: & her book of extracts. How she grinds! And authorsâ€™ vanity; which was to be ravaged by fear of what oneâ€™s Aunt thinks of a review. She professed never to care, for herself, what reviewers said, & then began uneasily a story about the hostility of the Lit. Sup. to her last six novels; & how they had put her Milton into small type at the end. At which unconscious revelation we smiled. She is a ravaged sensitive old hackâ€”as I should be, no doubt, save for L. Mary Fisher recalls Boo; but has a mean look a sharp practical lookâ€”derived from Lettice. She puts me out of conceit with the family face. Too insipid. The hair too mousy & untidy & the clothes dowdy. A drop of Fisher blood dilutes & acidifies. But she is upstanding; has lived in good company; is not a mere drudge; & adores her father, I guess; Likes authority; loves Winchester Oxford & the very urbane intellectual aristocracy; but I was not whizzed off my perch. The King of Jugoslavia & Bartou murdered this evening.
