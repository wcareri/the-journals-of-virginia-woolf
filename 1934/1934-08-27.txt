### Monday 27 August

The week end better. I am trying to start the nameless book again; & of course find it grinding, to try to get back into those stiff boots. All the same, I enjoyed the week end. Lyn left; which was all to the good, as she has no great range poor Lyn, & Wâ iliam had, I guessed, said all he could say. Then Lyons came, & subtly pervaded the house with a smell of stale cabbage. â€œAt Jimmy Gunnâ€™s cocktail yesterday â€¦. I said to Sickertâ€”. dining in Mayfair.â€ He is not merely secondrate, but almost criminal; which is amusing, once in a way. A South African Jew & sharper, Wm said. Probably the son of a small tailor. Stammers on the letter A. has a sexual delusion. He told us of a small hat black woman, who; divorced her husband, 6ft 4 & in the Guards, lives at Uckfield & leaves Neil at 2. am. She drives through Lewes & blackguards the police. He would not repeat the word she used. Then Lavender the gardener is an ex-burglar: has done 14 years in gaol, & is a preventive detention man, under charge of Hancock. (This ex burglar came round the other night to borrow 15 /-). Heâ€”Neilâ€”has his prattling amiability though, & amused me with his stories of making cigarettes & gathering samphire. A nimble light fingered little monstrosity, much concerned to amuse, to impress, & much afflicted with various desires. He eats corn cobs; & may unhappily come round to bring me some, & show off his cigarettes. What a dip in the kitchen pail! Wm. gone this morning. I doubt that I have anything to add to the portrait of

Wm. save that I think he is losing charm, & perhaps adding weight. Another novel coming this autumn. No reference to the Press. Lyn gave him a scrap of her own hand to decipher, which I thought unfair.
