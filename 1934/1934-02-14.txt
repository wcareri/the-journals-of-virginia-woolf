### Wednesday 14 February

But it was rather a bad headache: 10 days recumbent, sleeping, dreaming, dipping into oh dear how many different books, how capriciously: Thackeray, Youngâ€™s travels in Franceâ€”but too many revolutions on hand actually: I dont want to read of them: I want turnips & peace & settlement; then a book a day from the Times, Berners, Selincourt & a stout life by Neale of Q. Elizabeth which pretending to impartiality emphasises the double chin & the wig of Mary at the critical moment: a fig for impartial & learned historians! All men are liars.

And so to Rodmell for the week end, & the bees buzzing in the hyacinths: the earth emerging very chastened & sharpened from winter under a veil; which became fog as we drove up, & is fog today. In addition, the house rings with the clamour of electricians: the new bath water engine being inserted; & then the Surveyor comes & says we are weighting the floors down with books: a heavy bill threatens; so out to buy ink for my new Waterman, with which I am to take notes for a new Common Reader; & Ethel Sands to teaâ€”my first visitor. Yesterday I had Ivy Davison for the first time to write letters. No letters therefore today. Now I have just refused the Nat. Portrait Gallery offer to draw me, thank God, & am very cautiously revising Sickert.
