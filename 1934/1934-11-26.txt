### Monday 26 November

At Rodmell for the week end. My Lodge is demolished; the new house in process of building in the orchard. There will be open doors in front; & a view right over to Caburn. I think I shall sleep there on summer nights. I, made out a careful map of the week; & then, of course, come home & find us asked by the Kauffers to a show of Man Rayâ€™s photographs in Bedford Sq. So we go, & find Aldous, Mary & Jack, & a South American Vastaâ€”was that what Roger called these opulent millionaires from Buenos Aires? Anyhow she was very ripe & rich; with pearls at her ears, as if a large moth had laid clusters of eggs; the colour of an apricot under glass; eyes I think brightened by some cosmetic; but there we stood & talked, in French, & English, about the Estancia, the great white rooms, the cactuses, the gardenias, the wealth & opulence of South America; so to Rome & Mussolini, whom sheâ€™s just seen. He was simple & kindâ€”on purpose. She sat & forgot to call him Excellency. And he said sometimes he woke in the night & wondered Are my people happy? She said he is the CouÃ© of Italy: repeats every day & every way &c. Also spoke of women: how no great manâ€”Bismarck, Napoleon, Caesar, needed them: how Beatrice was only Florence. And how we all make mistakes: hers had been that she made an unhappy marriage. â€œBut now go & have a childâ€ he told her. The time is past she said. And so to Me de Noailles, dying of extinguished vanity in a small flat. She lay in bed, bedizened, covered with dozens & dozens of veils &c: began plucking them off; was never still a moment, lighting lamps & putting them out; demanded worship; was not old, but had outlived her fame. Nothing wrong with her but the death of her great fame. And she left letters to BarrÃ©s wh. his widow holds; & her doctor is piecing the story together. Then of a sudden we part; Man Ray says will I come & be photographedâ€”on Tuesday 3.30. Mary says she wants to come to tea. Thats the end of my planned weekâ€”almost.
