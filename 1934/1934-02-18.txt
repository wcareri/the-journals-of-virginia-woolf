### Sunday 18 February

And I began Here & Now again this morning, Sunday, at the point where I left off all but 3 weeks ago for my headache. Here I note that from 2 to 3 weeks is the right space. It has not gone cold, as after 6 weeks; I still carry it in my mind, & can see how to revise. It has goneâ€”the talk during the Raidâ€”running all over the place, because I was tired; now I must press together; get into the mood & start again. I want to raise up the magic world all round me, & live strongly & quietly there for 6 weeks. The difficulty is the usual oneâ€”how to adjust the two worlds. It is no good getting violently excited: one must combine. And I have the Nelly question on top of me in addition to the usual grind of what Ethel calls society. Some planning is therefore necessary. I have to â€˜seeâ€™ Ottoline, Ethel, K. Furse, Ly Cholmondeley (perhaps), E. Bowen: Lyn comes to dinner tonight to discuss her rather acid & thin blooded bantling. And Iâ€™ve made up my mind what Iâ€™m going to say. I will write if she lets me tell the truth.

The new electric boiler in & boiling our bath water this morning. The K. of Belgium killed mountaineering. All last week they were fighting in Vienna: this somehow comes closer than usual to our safe London life: the people shot down, why? John came to see L.: as spruce as ever; & has left his poems. We went to Angelica yesterday, & ate eggs in Mrs C.â€™s large Adams room. A. has to speak on Mrs Pankhurst. We watched Lacrosse. A. despises all games.
