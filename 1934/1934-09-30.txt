### Sunday 30 September

The last words of the nameless book were written 10 minutes ago; quite calmly too. 900 pages: L. says 200,000 words. Lord God what an amount of re-writing that means! But also, how heavenly to have brought the pen to a stop at the last line, even if most of the lines have now to be rubbed out. Anyhow the design is there. And it has taken a little less than 2 years: some months less indeed, as Flush intervened; therefore it has been written at a greater gallop than any of my books. The representational part accounts for this fluency. And I should sayâ€”but do I always say this?â€”with greater excitement; not, I think of the same kind quite. For I have been more general, less personal. No â€˜beautiful writingâ€™, much easier dialogue; but a great strain, because so many more faculties had to keep going at once, though none so pressed upon. No tears & exaltation at the end: but peace & breadth, I hope. Anyhow, if I die tomorrow, the line is there. And I am fresh; & shall re-write the end tomorrow. I dont think Iâ€™m fresh enough, thoâ€™, to go on â€˜making upâ€™. That was the strainâ€”the invention; & I suspect that the last 20 pages have slightly flagged. Too many odds & ends to sweep up. But I have no idea of the wholeâ€”

A fine, blowing day. Starlings bathing. Must now write to Helen.
