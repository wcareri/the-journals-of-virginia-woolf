### Tuesday 17 April

So jaded am I after last night that I cannot add a word to my Sickert or make out a sketch of the last chapters of Here & Now. A high price to pay for a hurried dinner at the Hutches; racing to Macbeth; talking to Dodo MacNaghten; then to Sir Fred Pollock on the stage of Sadlers Wells.

An idea about Shâ akespeare

That the play demands coming to the surfaceâ€”hence insists upon a reality wh. the hovel need not have, but perhaps should have. Contact with the surface. Coming to the top. This is working out my theory of the different levels in writing, & how to combine them: for I begin to think the combination necessary. This particular relation with the surface is imposed on the dramatist of necessity: how far did it influence Shre? Idea that one cd work out a theory of fiction &c on these lines: how many levels attempted, whether kept to or not.
