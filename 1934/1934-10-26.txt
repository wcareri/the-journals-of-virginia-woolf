Yesterday at Ottolineâ€™s. Old Yeats.

What he said was, he had been writing about me. The Waves. That comes after Stendhal he said. I see what youâ€™re atâ€”But I want more humanity. Cant bear Stendhal: observant [?]: photographic; has a passion for Balzac: reads & re-reads. Because his people are planted in history: there they are, sitting in the box at the opera: Tolstoy leaves them at school. Iâ€™m trying to get the Irish back to the great men of the 18th Century. Swift!

But did Swift like Ireland.

Readâ€”(what? draper letter?) He started the whole Irish movementâ€”made Irish different from English. Oh the bitterness against England.

Must get their back to their own speech.

You have always been rich & powerful. You create without hatred. The need of tragedy: some cause: that is what creates literature.

Rather vague about the Ethns. Takes 300 years to absorb a war. Not yet time to create after 1914. Must get dignity into letters.

Goldsmithâ€™s English.

The Occult. That he believes in firmly. All his writing depends on it. Was walking with Robinson Ellis. The words came to him â€œThe world is the excrement of Godâ€: 2 minutes afterwards R.E. said them. This convinced Yeats of the existence of another mind. A woman accused him of being the father of her child. He went to Lady Jowett. She wrote a message in Greekâ€”Oh sweet singerâ€”showed it to Waley at Brit. Mus: said it was written by an Englishmanâ [?] 200 years ago. Anyhow this proves absolutely the existence of another mind. Neither religion nor science explains the world. The occult does explain it. All in Plotinus. Has seen things. His coat hanger advanced across the room one night. Then a coat on it, illuminated: then a hand in it. Is writing his memoirs. About Moore & Ly Gregory. Ave Vale all nonsense. At the age of 50 Moore found himself impotent. Hence his sex mania. â€˜I dont know why he minded so muchâ€™. Scene with M.â€™s cook & the policeman. Is there no law to defend me from omelettes like that? This went on for 1Â½ hours, I should say. At last Ott brought up Pudley, & the session ended. I was too jaded after Rosamond Spender Read & Plomer & the incessant rather sniping talk about Grigson & Stephenâ€™s muddled theories to whip my brain: but felt Yeatsâ€™ extreme directness, simplicity, & equality: liked his praise; liked him: but cant unriddle the universe at tea. He is older, less coloured & vigorous. Little burning eyes behind great glasses: ruffled hair: tweeds. Philip aged, whitened, fallen in: almost 70 I suppose. A new cumquhat dog: various obscure dowds: one Dilys Powell: & so on. Home to sleep over the fire: & now to Rodmell.

Yeats said that in writing his memoirs he had to leave out himself, because no man could tell the truth about the women in his life. Also no man knew about himself. Somebody had cast his horoscope & given him a character, the very opposite of his own conception; but as he now saw, this was his real character. He believes entirely in horoscopes. Will never do business with anyone without having their horoscope. Is trying to get a play acted in London, at the Gate. But no actor can produce a play. Actors only know their own parts. They cant see that theres a piebald horse outside the window.

Yeats always has â€˜a narrative manâ€™ with whom he goes for walksâ€”a man who tells a story.

Yeats said of Proust â€œa slow motion novelâ€.
