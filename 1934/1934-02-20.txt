### Tuesday 20 February

To note the interesting stages of the duel with Nelly. Today I said, do you want this quarrel to go on? I would like it to stop now; but I shall discuss it later. Whereupon she said she wished it to end, but it was all my fault. And she wished to have nothing hanging over her. So I am indifferent calm & Lord knows if I shall shant give her notice tomorrow.
