### Wednesday 11 July

I dont like this patternâ  any better I think; but no matter. L. says all Swans have soft snub noses. And this feels so but less taut. The heat goes onâ€”the burning dry heat. Mabel making jam sweats: Iâ€™m forced to take a cab just now; Iâ€™m writing about belief in a city church by way of a change. Iâ€™m letting the subconscious populate. So dazed & dusty: I rather think of marking time till August & Rodmell: where we take Mabel, shall have Louie Everest I think as permanent. We saw her last week endâ€”a merry little brown eyed mongrel who came running to meet us in the road. Yesterday tea with Nessa; & the Morrisâ€™s there; today Osbert. I make these marks. & hear Johnâ€™s voice in Miss Westâ€™s room signing his name. L. there.
