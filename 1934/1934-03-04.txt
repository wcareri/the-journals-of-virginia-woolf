### Sunday 4 March

10 to eleven on Sunday March 4thâ€”a fine day, no fog; & Iâ€™m to sit to Nessa for the last time in 10 minutes; & the house is being done, & weâ€™ve taken rooms at Pippaâ€™s, &â€”&.

As for Here & Now Iâ€™m going to start that seriously tomorrow. Kitty & Ed. in Richmond: this Chapter is to be visual & animal; spring; movement; plants; birds dogs; airs; flowers.

Yesterday at Ethel Smythâ€™s mass. The Queen in the box: nodding from side to side; Ethel in her 3 cornered hat beside her; with her hand up. The Q. bowing, doing her duty graciously. So to Lyonsâ€”I forget the massâ€”where in that sordid crumby room assembled the garish Ly Diana, Ly Cunard, & the pensive Ly Lovat & ourselves; amid clerks & shop girls eating cream buns. All rather strident & obvious & rubbing too much on one string as usual to be very interesting Yet it had elementsâ€”The great sun setting behind the trees in Hyde Pk. as we drove back. Oh dear me, L. is doing the books & wont let me help. Lydiaâ€™s Dolls House tonight; on Wednesday Nessaâ€™s Private view; Sickert here to teaâ€”rather a rusty rat trap that man with hard little eyes, very oldâ€”no illusions about his own greatness. â€œTheyâ€™ll collect it all one of these daysâ€ he said, sublimely about his art criticâ isms. My BBC Comtee suppressedâ€”thank the Lord. No official positions for me. Now to sit.
