### Thursday 2 August

My mind, only how call it so solid a name, still running not upon dear old Frankie, who may be dyingâ€”but our convention is to be very cheerful & objectiveâ€”but upon that gnat Sybil. Why didnt I remind her when I wrote of the way she treated me, how she put me off twice here. What a stinging rejoinder that would have beenâ€”& I only thought of it yesterday. But perhaps I can still get it in. A curious problem: why was I not even mildly annoyed at the time, & now, in August, why am I acutely irritated. Cliveâ€™s drop of poison, I suppose, managed to crystallise the whole thing; the oddly vivid & upsetting effect of knowing that oneâ€™s been talked about. The reflection of myself in Courtauldâ€™s drawing room, being made the subject of her & Cliveâ€™s jeers & sneers. But I dont mean to have another row, Ã  la Eddy.

And this fly in the eye makes it impossible for me to seeâ€”no, thats not true, I can â€˜seeâ€™ the nursing home, the bed, the surgeon; I can act ones last night, & being waked early in Welbeck St & all thatâ€”my eye is quite remorselessâ€”but I dont feel. However, these flies gradually dismember themselves, & perish.

Iâ€™m worried too with my last chapters. Is it all too shrill & voluble? And then the immense length, & the perpetual ebbs & flows of invention. So divinely happy one day; so jaded the next.

Louieâ€™s first morning here. A leap in the dark rather. Mabel making currant jam. Vast basins of black currants which she heads & tails. Mabel had a chicken that lived with her 14 years & was called Old George.
