### Saturday 15 September

I was glad we went to the service on Thursday. It was a very hot summers day. And all very simple & dignified. Music. Not a word spoken. We sat there, before the open doors that lead into the garden. Flowers & strollers which Roger would have liked. He lay under an old red brocade with two bunches of very bright many coloured flowers. It is a strong instinct to be with ones friends. I thought of him too, at intervals. Dignified & honest & largeâ€”â€œlarge sweet soulâ€â€”something ripe & musical about himâ€”& then the fun & the fact that he had lived with such variety & generosity & curiosity. I thought of this. Karin annoyed me coming in late, stumbling. That went off. They played Bach. Then the coffin moved slowly through the doors. They shut. They played againâ€”Anon, I think: old music. Yes, I liked the wordlessness: Helen looking very young & blue eyed & quiet & happy. That is much to remember her for. I kissed her on the lips, in the courtyard. Then Desmond came up: said wdnt it be nice to walk in the garden? â€œOh we stand on a little islandâ€ he said. But it has been very lovely I said. For the first time I laid my hand on his shoulder, & said dont die yet. Nor you either he said. We have had wonderful friends, he said. We walked a little, but Molly was out of it, with her deafness. So we took them to Wellington Sqre & had tea. A merry natural talk, about Roger & books & people, all as usual: Molly breaking in, about her philograph, & her books. Queer isolation of deafnessâ€”breeding this rather peevish but pathetic egotism. And it was roasting hot. Dâ€™you remember the dinner we gave the Memoir Club said Desmond in the streetâ€”looking at his dinner table. Never again said Molly. Oh yes, I said; & we drove off.

Very jaded; cant write; all my books seem a complete jerkedâ  failure. I must take a few days off. Ann & Judith upon us: then Dadie.
