### Wednesday 11 April

I am a little proud of myself; for I have just read through the last pages, & now pat myself on the back, & say that I kept to my resolution, through thick & thin, & am now back here with Nelly gone, Annie upstairs, & Mabel, declared by Ha. to be a treasure, coming to see me tomorrow. So this has been definitely accomplished, after all these years. The sense of freedom & calmâ€”no more brooding; no more possessiveness; no more sense of being part of Nellyâ€™s world; & her planted there. Even if the cooking is less luxurious, that is all to the good. We had a horrid day last Wednesdayâ€”a fortnight ago; she trailed about, some how pathetic, to me, catching at me, & whimpering & revealing her own vanity. â€œBut theyâ€™ll blame meâ€”â€ However, she rattled off her spiteful little noise at L. when the parting came, thinking only of herself as usual; & there we left her in the kitchen, grasping a wet cloth; â€œNo I really couldnâ€™t Sirâ€ she said, when L. held out his hand. How dazed & free & quiet I felt driving down to Lewes! She has taken with her all the cookery books, except too elementary manuals, & the chair coverâ€”a last spasm of possessive spite.
