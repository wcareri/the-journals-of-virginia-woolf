### Friday 27 July

Rodmell begins again: with this difference, we have Mabel just arrived, this instant; & Louie, who is moving in today. And the usual helter skelter, tidying, & nothing to settle to; must at once go to Worthing, then come back to a meeting. Not the kind of day I much like, & would rather have no servant in the house; but we shall see. Also, my old brain must wake & bestir itself over Here & Now.

This is written to kill time, as I cant settle in. Perhaps we have too many possessions. Too many tables & chairs.

Mrs B, last night: has had her hair shingled. Propped against the door talked & talked. How difficult she found it to spend money though she now has it after all those years of stinting. Had given Annie a cheque. Also pays old Greyâ€™s insurance. A queer genuine, though untamed, I mean uneducated sprayâ€”I mean so tremulous & wispishâ€”something wild & vagrant; this becoming more quiet; in fact rather a nice sharp kind woman. Now she has a cheque book & draws cheques. Theres the money coming, she said. She wants to leave Rodmell. Percy doesnâ€™t. She advertises for rooms at Colchester. Cant get them. So there it is, when we can afford to go we cant. But she has been very kind coming up to oblige, washing up doing the rooms. She cooks a bit of meat for Mrs Greyâ€”whose name is Squelch. Oh Iâ€™m too bothered & ditheredâ€”wish to sleepâ€”but must go to Worthing instead.
