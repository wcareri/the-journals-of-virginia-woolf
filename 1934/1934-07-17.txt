I forgot to put in about the Colefax Row, curiously enough. How she wrote me a violent letterâ€”better to break all togetherâ€”can no longer have you in my life, because I put off dinner to meet Noel Coward. She pleads her most difficult life: Sir Arthur? This is one of the dryest & hottest of summers. At it again this morning. And heat brings such lassitude; & people swarm. I have let them die out, be extinct: Osbert for instance; with his very sensual Royal Guelf face; his extreme uneasiness; his childish vanity always striking the two notes: rank & genius: so easily touched by praise, so eager. Told me the story of the lady in the pink hat. He lectures in the provinces, indeed rather likes the Prince in disguise part which he plays, staying with his dentist at Gerrards X perhaps. Well, he had a letter from Verena, to say she had always posed as familiar with him: would he lend himself to the deception & recognise her? She wd wear a pink hat. So he exclaimed, out loud, Oh Verena! what a pleasure to see you! The story would have gone better had she not been Verena. So he went off to swim for an hour before dining with Princess Mary & so on. A sensitive man; voluble; augustâ , uneasy; spending 6 months in China alone: & gushing words. Still I like himâ€”why I dont know.

And then the Ecclesâ€™ on Sunday at Cliveâ€™s & the Whistler picture, & talk of Margaret, my little owl done by command; for I went to fetch the picture & there was old Dick, & Margaret & I sobbedâ€”she so soft simple & statelyâ€”in the dining room of the hired house. A curious scene: some sincerity welling up after all these indifferent years. L. talking to bluff tough gruff Dick in the drawing room. M. to stay with him & see the beech woods of Highclere. Mrs Eccles the pretty daughter of Ld Dawson of Penn. C. called her an aristocrat. Clive very flighty & talking French. Râ . looking under his eye at the Whistler. Dyou know, Iâ€™m getting less & less sure. Iâ€™m not sure of that arm: & thereâ€™s a certain flatness â€¦ No, Iâ€™d rather you asked Turnerâ€™s advice, which Clive explained, when R. went, because R. had been duped over a Whistler once, when Clive was in the right. Mr E. a slab faced agent de change: I put stockbroker in French because Iâ€™m rather slick in that language now, & have 2 weekly lessons from Janie. This is a real solid triumph, to have made myself face that curious fearâ€”about Frenchâ€”& have now, I think, routed it. Vita to lunch, after many weeks, yesterday, with her MS. which, L. says, is perilous fantastic stuff, a woman flagellated in a cave. How much will the public stand? She has a joke about the prostate gland which we are asking her to reconsider. She has grown opulent & bold & redâ€”tomatoe coloured, & paints her fingers & lips which need no paintâ€”the influence of Gwen; underneath much the same; only without the porpoise radiance, & the pearls lost lustre.
