### Wednesday 18 April

A curious little fact.

Instead of smoking 6 or 7 cigarettes as I write of a morning, I now, for 3 mornings, make myself smoke one only. And rather enjoy doing without.

Tonight Tom & Maynard dine to discuss Tomâ€™s book; After Strange Gods. Julian & E. Bowen come in afterwards. I want to try & make myself write down the discussion tomorrow, as I am keeping off fiction.
