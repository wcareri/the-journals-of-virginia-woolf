Human misery is certainly very great. We wish to comfort Nessa; have her to dinner; & tell her about Julianâ€™s poems. At once she ruffles like a formidable hen. I am irritated. This is the religion & superstition of motherhood. Wellâ€”L. then speaks, emphatically but reasonably. She is also reasonable but cold. All our feelings are confused: mine discreditable. Why does it irritate me so, this maternal partiality? Anyhow, we all sit exacerbating ourselves, instead of consoling. And she is like a stone wall when I hint that Julian might mend his mannersâ€”at least be more considerateâ€”perhaps conciliate Lady Râ , â€œLike Eddie Playfairâ€”she said at once. No, thats not Julianâ€™s way.â€ And â€œI should have thought that anyone of sense could have seenâ€”Mrs Grant thought him charmingâ€ .. &c &c. Then why does J. beg us to get him a job? No, it was not a nice evening; & she is lonely without Roger. And the S. American Okampo sent me orchids. I dislike many of my feelings. Most of all I hate the hush & mystery of motherhood. How unreal it all is!
