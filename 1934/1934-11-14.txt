Here I am taking a morning off to breathe in before I tackle the 9 volumes of that book. And I am dissipated & rather frittered. There is no doubt that to talk to Sibyl is very depressing. She mews & mows. Wont speak out; complains with one breath, asks pity but cant be induced to say what is on her mind. Perhaps there is very little there. She said â€˜One is no longer so young as one was. Arthur is getting deaf. So I have to stand in a shop all day.. But one shouldnâ€™t beâ€”â€™ I think she called it â€˜crimpingâ€™â€”I forget the exact word. Oblique references were made then to our quarrel. And I was hampered: couldnt get hold of her. Off she went, sentimentally mournful, apologetic. And she impeded Margery who came at the same momentâ€”so that too remains, as they say, in abeyance. And this cringing makes my own soul flop.
