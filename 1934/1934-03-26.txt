### Monday 26 March

â€œThe worst is to comeâ€â€”that is with Nelly. Well it is now coming very nearâ€”by this timeâ€”3.30â€”tomorrow it will be over. Arid then thereâ€™ll only be the one dreadful day & we shall be off. I feel executioner & the executed in one. Meanwhile it is a brilliant spring day; Iâ€™m back in my studio, white, clean, more spacious, after 3 days of Pippaâ€™s. Miss Walton is arranging books; Hugh, Stephen, William, Ott, & Vita all coming to tea & so on; I dine with Vita; then must ring up Eth Bowen about our Irish tour, & so the immitigable day passes. I face up to it without any evasion: this has to be lived I say to myself.
