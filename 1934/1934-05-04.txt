### Friday 4 May

Galway

A phrase made this windy day: the clouds looping up their skirts & letting down a shaft of light. We picked bright blue gentians on the cliff looking towards the Aran Islands. This, though raining & cloudy, was one of our best drivesâ€”to the sea; views over folds of wild land with one or two orange & yellow white cottages: the sea blue, stone coloured or deep black: the waves tossing their hair back. People gathering sea weed & heaping carts. Extreme poverty. So on to Galway which has 2 great bookshops, otherwise wild, poor, sordid. We saw the Claddagh; shawled women, coated men, all standing in groups together beside thatched huts, like islanders, waiting for a funeral. This the original Irish quarter; G. Thompson whom we found sitting before his Greek books in a little room looking on the sea came to the hotel after dinner & told us how they spend their lives in talk, dont mind poverty so much. He teaches 6[?] Galways Greek in Irish. Directly he went, at 11, up started a wild pale Irishman & poured forth more talk. â€œI hear youâ€™re going to Dublin. Please dont miss the Guinness brewery or the 4 mummified nuns.â€ & so on. He was agent for a Radio Company & was touring Ireland; was Irish, but had lived in America; a mixture of Siegfried Sassoon & Robert Graves to look at, but internally preoccupied with breweries & nuns. Pouring wet; a gale; & off now to Dublin.
