### Monday 15 October

Walked with L. all round Serpentine & K. Gardens yesterday (a fine blowy day: leaves falling) & asked him these questions:

1) What is the sensible attitude to criticism?  
Not to read it.

2) What should I do now of a morningâ€”creation flagging?  
Read.

3) Does he feel I have prevented him from going abroad?  
No. I have only prevented him from lesser activities (I think this was the answer).

We agreed to save up for foreign travel on a large scale to try to fly over America. Perhaps to go to India & China.

I now see us, far far away. A new civilisation &c.

I meant to read this morning, but got tempted into making notes for biography. Rather scrappy, but clearly the only complete escape from depression (W.L. & Râ â€™s death) is in getting the mind to work. No anodyne possible I think in the morning. But I am as slack as a piece of maccaroni: & in this state cant shake off a blackness, a blankness. Now (10 to 1) after writing & beginning to read an old life of Boswell I feel the wheels grinding.

Ethelâ€”oh dâ€”nâ€”after tea. Morgan tomorrow. Yes: creation drops the little personal body down: up we go: all that forgotten.

Oh & L. was divinely good: so direct: what an immense relief to talk to him! what a simplification. What an egress to open air & cold daylight: how dignified: yes, & I have him every day, as I so often think. So whyâ€”. &c. &c.
