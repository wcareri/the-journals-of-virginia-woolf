Glenbeith

On again, after an extremely interesting encounter at the windy hotel with Irelandâ€”that is Mr & Mrs Rowlands; he is a giant, very shapely, small head, obliterated features; she small, abrupt, vivacious. They began directly, & so we talked,â€”they accepted us as their sort, & were gentry, Irish gentry, very much so, he with a house 500 years old, & no land left. â€œBut I love my King & Country. Whatever they ask me to do Iâ€™d do itâ€â€”this with great emotion. Oh yes, we believe in the British Empire; we hate the madman de ValÃ©ra.â€ There they live, 14 miles from Cork, hunting, with an old retriever dog, & go to bazaars miles & miles away. â€œThats the way we liveâ€”no nonsense about usâ€”not like the English people. Now Iâ€™ll give you my name, & Iâ€™ll write to my friend & sheâ€™ll tell you of a houseâ€”& I hope youâ€™ll live in Ireland. We want people like ourselves. But wait, till the budget.â€ This she said, with all the airs of the Irish gentry: something very foreign about her, like old Lady Young, & yet in slave to London; of course everyone wants to be English. We think Englands talking of usâ€”not a bit. No said the obliterated Greek torso, for such he was, when I was courting my wifeâ€”she lived in Liverpoolâ€”the young chaps used to say â€œnow Paddy tell us one of your storiesâ€ but now they dont take any interest in us. But Iâ€™d do anything for my King & Country, though youve always treated us very badly.

So we got on to the Bowens; & established ourselves as of their sort. Yes I felt this is the animal that lives in the shell. These are the ways they liveâ€”he hunting all day, & she bustling about in her old car, & everybody knowing everybody & laughing & talking & picnicking, & great poverty & some tradition of gentle birth, & all the sons going away to make their livings & the old people sitting there hating the Irish Free State & recalling Dublin & the Viceroy.

On to Tralee & saw the gipsies coming down the road & thought of G. being buried.
