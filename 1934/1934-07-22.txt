### Sunday 22 July

We went round, I continue, to fill in ten minutes on Sunday morningâ€”a grey blue sky above the skylight, to Nessa with fruit; & found her sublimely in command of the situation as usual. Elly [Rendel] in a panic insisting upon a nurse: look at the haemorrhage; can you take the responsibility? Certainly I can said Nessa: anyhow I must. Iâ€™m not young, & Iâ€™ve seen bloodier bandages than these. This too at the nerve racking hour of dawn. So she triumphed. I doubt whether I could have. Perhaps. Walked as usual this summer in the Park; & saw the people playing bowls, & were happy to think that next week we shall have our own bowls. Also how shall we spend our legacy? Poor old George only left Â£7000 or so of money: what had he done with the rest? After dinner we listened to a very good concert; L. made cigarettes, & I followed my new diversion of book binding. I am covering Proust in little shiny squares of gummed paper that one buys for 6d at Kettles: a great relief to work oneâ€™s fingers. Letter from Elizabeth Reedâ€”ecstatic, highfalutin, unreal, in spite of miscarriage on the moors.
