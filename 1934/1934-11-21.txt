Margery Fry to tea on Sunday. A long debate about the book on Roger: not very conclusive. She says she wants a study by me, reinforced with chapters on other aspects. I say, well but those books are unreadable. Oh of course I want you to be quite free she says. I should have to say something about his life, I say. The familyâ€”Now there of course Iâ€™m afraid I should have to ask you to be careful, she says. Agnes is stone deaf; has lived all her life in the family. I couldnâ€™t let her be hurtâ€”And so on. The upshot of all of which is that sheâ€™s to write to the NS. asking for letters: that Iâ€™m to go through them; that weâ€™re then to discussâ€”so it will drag on these many months, I suppose. And I plan working at P.s: & getting in reading time with Rogerâ€™s papers, so that by October next I could write, if thats the decision. But what?

A fog lasting several days. Both of us rather cheerful again. L. has finished the first part of Quack: & it goes along vigorously. And weâ€™ve seenâ€”Lady Rhondda, Heard, Eth Williamson, Julian; Lyn; Tom; Kitchin; Hope â€¦. in fact weâ€™ve done our duty as party givers, & today heave a sigh of heavenly gladness because Raymond has a cold & puts our dinner with him off. I am reading, with interest & distaste, Wells; I want to read a great deal; & the P.s goes at 8 or 9 pages daily. & that is why I feel content.

Tomâ€™s head is very remarkable; such a conflict; so many forces have smashed against him: the wild eye still; but all rocky, yellow, riven, & constricted. Sits very solidâ€”large shouldersâ€”in his chair, & talks easily but with authority. Is a great man, in a way, now: self confident, didactic; But to me, still, a dear old ass; I mean I cant be frozen off with this divine authority any longer. Not a very good evening. Talk scattered & surface pattering. Hope & her dog distracting. Kitchin a little fat & white & cunning & not up to the mark. A rather conceited touchy man, I guess; has a good opinion of himself; & is slightly commonplace. But how little I care now, for these slight misfits. Generally thereâ€™s some fun to be hadâ€”a saying, an attitude. Tom is larger minded than of old; â€œBut thats only humanâ€ he said, when I asked him if he still liked seeing his own name in print.
