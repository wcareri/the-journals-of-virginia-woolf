### Thursday 19 July

Is my brain dwindling, I ask myself after 1Â½ hours writing at the Fact & Fictionâ€”that is, I am revising the first chapter of that old bugbear of mine on fiction. And I get so knotted & jaded; never mind. I shall lie flat a little in brain, for a few days: until I feel the well full. That is, I am priming myself for a final go at Here & Now. It is still so hotâ€”so hotâ€” my skylight painted smooth blue every morningâ€”when we hear rain as we did last night we rush to the window. A puddle the rarest of sights. Smell of wet earth delicious. We drive to Cambridge to dine with Rothschilds tonightâ€”home by starlight. Mary rings up to ask us to dine to meet Tom. How heavenly to drive by night she says. Cant because Jack wont. I did not go to Edith Jones cocktail or her party yesterday, & so felt assuaged; walked in Oxford St: bought a 15/- servants dress. Sun came out, though very soon: bought a melon therefore. How pleasant to have coins in oneâ€™s purse. On the whole a well managed summer, if my head were more vigorous. Oh these long books, what a tremendous effort they areâ€”to whole the entire span on my shoulders. And as Bogy Harris said, you must go on now till you die. Which is true.

No letters; no fame; rather a relief, to sit in the shade & spin. Julian trying for a Chinese professorship; will hear today. He dined & brought a skatelike looking womanâ€”a mouth cut in a wide fishlike faceâ€”entirely obtuse: sucking greedy. Why does J. like such inanities?
