### Friday 5 October

The storm is over; having sunk a few ships. And half blown us along the towing path; & tossed all the apples off the trees. We are discussing plans for moving this lodge to the churchyard wall under the tree. Wicksâ€™ estimate is for Â£157â€”which seems extreme, considering that its only a fad: will improve the view but then perhaps an improved view is worth 157. Water is also to be laid on: & I am in a mood rather to doubt my own earning capacity. That is to say the last chapter is going to give me a deal of trouble. But perhaps it is wrong to lay such stress on last chapters. They need not necessarily rise higher than the level of the book. My instinct is though that they shd. be more condensed: a summing up: a solution. If the last chapter fails does the book fail? What is the last chapter of War & Peace? I forget.

The names of the BBC committee are out: & I am interested to feel two different emotions: disappointment & relief; & a third, that it dont much matter either way.
