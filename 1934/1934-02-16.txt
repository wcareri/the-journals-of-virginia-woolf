### Friday 16 February

Five minutes here before going to lunch with Nessa. A great Nelly row yesterday; which Thereby declare the last. It was about the workmen & her day out, & the end was that we had eggs for lunch & were forced to dine at the Cock, expensively & badly. No more of this, I say, & anticipate many days of. ill ease, some violent scenes, & then pray God, after Easter, peace.

Finished my Sickert article all the same. I put off Here & Now till next week.
