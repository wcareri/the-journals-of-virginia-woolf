### Wednesday 12 September

Roger died on Sunday. I was walking with Clive on the terrace when Nessa came out. We sat on the seat there for a time. On Monday we went up with Nessa. Ha came. Nessa saw Helen. Tomorrow we go up, following some instinct, to the funeral. I feel dazed: very wooden. Women cry, L. says: but I dont know why I cryâ€”mostly with Nessa. And Iâ€™m too stupid to write anything. My head all stiff. I think the poverty of life now is what comes to me. a thin blackish veil over everything. Hot weather. A wind blowing. The substance gone out of everything. I dont think this is exaggerated. Itâ€™ll come back I suppose. Indeed I feel a great wish, now & then, to live more all over the place, to see people, to create, only for the time one cant make the effort. And I cant write to Helen, but I must now shut this & try.

Maupassant, on writersâ€”(true I think).

â€œEn lui aucun sentiment simple nâ€™existe plus. Tout ce quâ€™il voit, ses joies, ses plaisirs, ses souffrances, ses desespoirs, deviennent instantanÃ©ment des sujets dâ€™observation.. Il analyse malgrÃ© tout, malgrÃ© lui, sans fin, les coeurs, les visages, les gestes, les intonations.â€

I remember turning aside at motherâ€™s bed, when she had died, & Stella took us in, to laugh, secretly, at the nurse crying. Sheâ€™s pretending, I said: aged 13. & was afraid I was not feeling enough. So now.

The writerâ€™s temperament.

â€œne jamais souffrir, penser, aimer, sentir comme tout le monde, bonnement, franchement, simplement, sans sâ€™analyser soi-meme apres chaque joie et aprÃ¨s chaque sanglotâ€
