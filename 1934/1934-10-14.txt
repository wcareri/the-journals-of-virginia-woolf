The trouble is I have used every ounce of my creative writing mind in the Pargiters. No headache (save what Elly calls typical migraineâ€”she came to see L. about his strain yesterday). I cannot puts spurs in my flanks. Its true Iâ€™ve planned the romantic chapter of notes: but I cant set to.

This morning Iâ€™ve taken the arrow of Wâ .L. to my heart: he makes tremendous & delightful fun of B. & B.: calls me a peeper, not a looker, a fundamental prude; but one of the 4 or 5 living (so it seems) who is an artist. Thats what I gather the flagellation amounts to: (Oh Iâ€™m underrated, Edith Sitwell says). Well: this gnat has settled & stung; & I think (12.30) the pain is oyer. Yes. I think its now rippling away. Only I cant write. When will my brain revive? in 10 days I think. And it can read admirably: I began The Seasons last night; after Eddieâ€™s ridiculous rhodomontadeâ€”or so I judge it: like Madame Tussauds: a vast book called The Sun in Capricorn: a worthless book I think; so that my intention to make a beckon in his direction is now in abeyance. No. I donâ€™t like him. Trash & tarnish; and this morbid silliness. Denzil Torrant. &c.

Well: I was going to say, Iâ€™m glad that I need not & cannot write, because the danger of being attacked is that it makes one answer backâ€”a perfectly fatal thing to do. I mean, fatal, to arrange the P.s so as to meet his criticisms. And I think my revelation 2 years ago stands me in sublime stead, to adventure & discover, & allow no rigid poses: to be supple & naked to the truth. If there is truth in W.L. well, face it: Iâ€™ve no doubt I am prudish & peeping, well then live more boldly. But for Godâ€™s sake dont try to bend my writing one way or the other. Not that one can. And there is the odd pleasure too of being abused: & the feeling of being dismissed into obscurity is also pleasant & salutary.
