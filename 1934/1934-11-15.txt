### Thursday 15 November

And am now, 10.30 on Thursday morning, Nov. 15th, about to tackle re-reading & re-writing The Pargiters. An awful moment.

12.45. Well that horrid plunge has been made, & Iâ€™ve started rewriting the P.s. Lord Lord! 10 pages a day for 90 days: three months. The thing is to contract: each scene to be a scene, much dramatised; contrasted; each to be carefully dominated by one interest; some generalised. At any rate this releases the usual flood & proves that only creating can bring about proportion: now, damnably disagreeable, as I see it will beâ€”compacting the vast massâ€”I am using my faculties again. & all the flies & fleas are forgotten.
