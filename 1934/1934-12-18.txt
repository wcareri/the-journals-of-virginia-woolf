### Tuesday 18 December

Talk with Francis yesterday. He is dying: but makes no bones about it: only his expression is quite different. Has no hope. The man says he asks every evening how long will this go on, & hopes for the end. He was exactly as usual; no wandering, no incoherence. A credit to atheism. The soul deserves to be immortal, as L. said. We walked back, glad to be alive: numb somehow. I cant use my imagination on that theme. What wd it be like to lie there, expecting death? & how odd & strange a death. I write hurriedly, going to Angelicaâ€™s concert this fine soft day.
