### Wednesday 1 August

Iâ€™m black & blue from their worrying,  
Theyâ€™ve tortured me early & late,  
Some with their love,â€”God help me!  
The others with their hate.

Why I trouble to copy out these lines which are from Heine, I dont know, except that they represent what happened to my perfect free day at Charleston yesterday. One ought not to have the illusion of perfect happinessâ€”that it is possible; yet again I did. And then, yes my friendsâ€”this is Sybil Colefax sneering to Clive at my taking too much care of myself; & this is Clive handing it on; & then this morning, poor old Francis paralysed; another operation tomorrow, under which says Nessa, it is to be hoped he may die, since the cancer has come back. She sees him today. How odd, ones last day, this: here very hot & fine. & then of course he may live. How I hate going through these thoughts again, & what a jumble of meanness & sordidity & the fine, oneâ€™s feelings are.

Remember, as far as Sâ .C. goes, never never to speak of health. In, fact this might be useful in all connections.
