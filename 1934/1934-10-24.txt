### Wednesday 24 October

I have just written with homage in my copy of Sickert. So thatsâ€™done.

And Stephen Spender, did I say, has defended me against W.L.; & Rosamond & Read & Stephen are coming tonight. And I have been toiling at an article on the Queen of Roumania: by way of a rest. No I cant write about Roger; & yesterday I went to see Lady Simon, in Catherine St. & looked at the conventional drawing room & tried to make out why it comes together. Two red & silver shields from Marshall & Snelgrove: a reproduction of an Italian picture; a comic parrot in watercolour; bad rugs; bears & lions; sham Adams mantelpiece; green, curtains; brown fumed oak stairs & carpetâ€”all uneasy trifles, too many details: no design: no taste: only one thing after another.

Shena on couch like Tristram.

â€œIâ€™ve been thinkingâ€”dont we lead a very narrow life at Manchester? We only see business men, university people, & social workers. Ought I to try & get artists to come?â€

Rather worried & puzzled: reiterative; pale after an operation: is going to the Argentine. Tell me, how do writers see things? Are you interested in all kinds of people. So I made up a scene. Am I rather acting? inventing? Well I was tired after Pamâ€™s nondescript visit: she cameâ€”why? Oh yes, Hike the country. Very nice. Very nice houseâ€”& the children like it. And Micu is going to do papers for sweets. A thousand yards at a time. She is becoming the driven sweet wife; very nice; childlike: no go, or backbone: no lookâ€”of Roger: but affectionate. So I walked home from Shena across Westminster: a warm spring day: summer clothes: people strolling: streets crowded.
