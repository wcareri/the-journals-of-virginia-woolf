### Sunday 6 May

Dublin

It is very windy wet & cold, & I am sitting alone after lunch in the lounge with a grey black netting woman. The scene is St Stephenâ€™s Green, an Irish attempt at Lincolnâ€™s Inn Fields, just as Merrion Square attempts Bedford Sqre & so on. We lunched at the Sherburne; & there are the film actors; here they are too. Aran islanders, in thick tweeds, who sit over the fire downstairs singing what may be hymns. I heard Irish for the first time. This is a dreary waiting moment. L. has to write letters. Then, perhaps we go to the Gallery. An air of inferiority sleeps or simpers or sneers or rages everywhere. A visitor from England brings back news of picture galleries, theatres. Here it is a mixture of Hampstead & Cambridge. At the Gate Theatre last night we were not sure which it was: thereâ€™s an edge of difference, & the play was good: about Emmett, advanced, pseudo-Auden, I imagine. Three instruments to make music. A curtain that wdnt close; much satire of the Irish love of bloodshed; satire of the attempts at culture; a sudden sense came over me of being in the midst of historyâ€”that is of being in an unsettled, feverish place, which would have its period given it in the books; anything may happen. Yet what can happen when the best restaurant in the capital is Jammets, when thereâ€™s only boiled potatoes in the biggest hotel in Dublin? Everywhere they seem to be living on watered wine. At last I gather why, if I were Irish, I should wish to belong to the Empire: no luxury, no creation, no stir, only the dregs of London, rather wish-washy as if suburbanised. Yet, I thought too at the Gate, they may have a spirit in them somewhere, that could make something, if freed. But they are freed, I continueâ€”& indeed the play said, sardonically, & only this provinciality is the result. I dont believe in the songs of the Aran islanders, or in old men who cant readâ€”that is, theyre not of necessity Homer. Their voices penetrate the glass door. The netting lady has let the fire out. The Arans are going out in full dress. I must run & see.

And I ran, & found a hot fire downstairs; & the old woman in the red shawl has moved off. Coming in yesterday I thought here was the cream of Dublin, meeting a cauliflower faced young man of redolent charm in the hall; and a fine bluff red genial man, & the little boysâ€”heres the ancient aristocracy of Ireland, I said, but it turned out to be the producerâ€”who lodges at the Sheâ lâ burneâ€”& his troop, who lodge here. A quarrel is going on between a lady & the manager. Nothing in the wide world wd. have induced me &c. This is what upsets orderly composition & makes it impossible for me to finishâ€”

Most unsatisfactoryâ€”will you look up my postcardâ€”inclusive boardâ€”

No, it wouldnt do living in Ireland, in spite of the rocks & the desolate bays. It would lower the pulse of the heart: & all oneâ€™s mind wd. run out in talk. â€œIts awfully nice to see you & looking so wellâ€â€”Sheâ€™s off with a tall Irish gentleman & silence falls.

Merrion Square is about 3 times the size of Bedford Square; at one time a passion for glory must have settled on the Irish, & then having run up street after street of Bedford Row off they went. Doctors & lawyers have crept into the 18th Century shells. Oh but theyre now discussing the character of the lady whoâ€™s so angry. Sheâ€™s handsome, sheâ€™s fine, but. who did she marry? & so on. Talk, talk, talk. Not as nice looking at allâ€”in the good old days they used to come.

Grafton Street is not on the level of Sloane Street. The quays are much like the Paris quays. Bookshops. Long architectural vistas; one house after another, but some a storey too tall. Very broad streets. Our car too grandâ€”this is what makes it impossible for me to finish Proust, I was about to say. Yet its been one of our most amusing tours. If only for the talk talk talk.
