### Friday 22 January

When L. pulled the curtains this morning, practically no light came in; there was a kind of greyish confusion outside — soft swirling incessant snow. This has gone on all day almost, sometimes changing to rain. The Green itself is very lovely; & lights up the room with its pure white glare. But the streets became brown directly. Of course, in this House of Trouble, the pipes burst; or got choked; or the roof split asunder. Anyhow in the middle of the morning, I heard a steady rush of water in the wainscoat; & Mr Le Grys, Lizzie & various people have been clambering about the roof ever since. The water still drips through the ceiling into a row of slop pails. Mrs Le Grys cries hysterically ''0 it'll be all right — you're insured''. The plumber refuses to leave his house in weather like this. We are going to hear the Fabians at Essex Hall. I daresay we shall be swept out of our beds tonight. Its a queer winter———the worst I ever knew, & suitable for the war & all the rest of it. I never said yesterday that I heard from Thomas Hardy! He wrote a very nice, very characteristic letter, & was much pleased that I wrote. So that my nocturnal impulse was from God.
