### Sunday 14 February

Rain again today. I cleaned silver, which is an easy & profitable thing to do. It so soon shines again. Philip came, & he and L. went for a walk. He lunched with us & stayed talking till 3:30. They despair more than ever now of getting to the front. All Regular officers are preferred above them. Cecil has a machine gun, which may lead to his going, &, if so, almost certainly to his being killed. Poor Philip was a good deal agitated, I thought, with his prospects. What is he to do after the war is over? He thinks he must emigrate. Cecil would like to stay on in the Army, which however, one can't do, unless one has money, & neither of them has a penny. Five hundred a year is considerably more valuable than beauty or rank. He stayed talking, wanting to talk about himself perhaps & had to go back to Colchester, where the only tolerable thing is the oysters. The men he declares never cease joking; & the worse things are the more they joke. Then walked down the river, in the face of a cold gale (which is now raging outside) & gladly came home to tea; & now sit as usual surrounded by books & paper & ink, & so shall sit till bedtime - save that I have some mending to do, my entire skirt having split in two yesterday. L. is writing a review of his Indian book. Jam now reading a later volume of Michelet, w ich is superb, & the only tolerable history. The people next door are singing the same song that they've been practising these 3 months - a hymn. From all this, it is clear that I don't want to mend my dress: & have nothing whatever to say.
