Mrs Woolf & Clara came to dinner. I dont know what it is about them — I daresay I'd better not try to define it. Perhaps their voices partly? — partly their manners. Anyhow, they gave us flowers & chocolates. Mrs W. sat & knitted. Clara smoked. I think Jewesses are somehow discontented. Clara is. Mrs W. has the mind of a child. She is amused by everything, & yet understands nothing — says whatever comes into her head — prattles incessantly, now good humoured, now ill humoured. She seems to like everyone equally, as if they were all the same. She told us how she used to go to bed with a basket of socks by her side, so as to start darning first thing in the morning.

Leonard went up to the School of Economics today. I wrote, & then went to Janet. Emphie & the cook have influenza — I was met by an elder sister — a shrewd, sensible elderly woman, who has taken charge of things. Janet seemed better, & said she was better. We talked about my novel (which everyone, so I predict will assure me is the most brilliant thing they've ever read; & privately condemn, as indeed it deserves to be condemned.) & about Shelley, & Poets & their immorality. She said that in her young days she would have disapproved of Shelley's relations with women — But the old sister dodged in & out, which made conversation about morality uneasy. Home & finished Pope, & so to bed.
