### Monday 11 January

Leonard was in his bath this morning, & I was lying in bed, wondering whether I should stretch out my hand for Rob Roy, when I heard a commotion next door, & then someone rushed downstairs crying in a strange, unnatural voice ''Fire! Fire!'' As it was obvious that the house was not on fire, to any large extent, I put on my waterproof & slippers before I looked out of the window. I then smelt paper burning. I then went into the passage, & found smoke pouring from the open door of the next room. There was clearly time to escape, so I withdrew; & heard Lizzy return with the lodger; & heard her begin ''I only put a bit of paper to draw the fireâ€” '' from which I guessed what had happened. ''In ten minutes the room would have been ablaze'' said the lodger. L. came back; & we looked out of our window, & saw a large Japanese screen, all in flames, burning on the grass plot. Later, I heard that the paper had caught; the draperies on the mantelpiece had caught; the screen had caught; the woodwork had caught. As every room in the house is lined with dry old wood, loosely papered over, 10 minutes I think, would have put the fire beyond water jugs â€” The lodger was in terror, too, for his priceless rugs: 'worth hundreds & hundreds' according to Mrs Le Grys. The wonder is how we have escaped so far, considering Lizzy. Yesterday she smashed two very nice bits of china for us.

We went up to London this afternoon: L. to see the editor of the New Statesman about an article on Diplomacy â€” I to go over a flat in Mecklenburgh Square. We met unexpectedly in M. Sqre. When we reached the house, however, the occupier refused to let us see it. So we had to apply to the owner, who lives a few doors off. We were shown into a beautiful room, which was disfigured horribly with velvet curtains, gigantic purple cushions, & the usual swarm of gilt & lemon coloured objects. The woman herself sat in an invalid chair, arranged, like a childs high chair, with a bar across it. Her hair (a flaxen wig) was plastered on either side of her head, & she had the usual powdered plump rouged look of Bloomsbury ladies. This always makes us both physically uncomfortable. She was very sensible however, a business woman, I suppose, owning several houses, & running them, I'm sure, at a profit. She made us see over her house, instead of the other one. We were taken over by a small, wizened, very amiable old lady, who had disfigured her part of the house until it was scarcely recognizable â€” The drawing room, in particular, where she had lavished her skill, made your eyes start with its innumerable, discordant, hideous small things â€” two clusters of flags displayed on the tables chiefly impressed me. There were all the flags of all the nations, I should think; all the photographs of all the royal families. It was like looking into a kaleidoscope, because of the innumerable separate dots of colour â€” & yet they weren't colour. I went on to Days Library & L. to the London Library. He has to write an article of 1200 words by Wednesday noon, on Diplomatistsâ€” A wonderful subject anyhow.
