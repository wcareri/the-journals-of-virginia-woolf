### Saturday 23 January

The Fabians were well worth hearing: still more worth seeing. Miss Atkinson drivelled at length about Peace â€” I could understand, always, & confute generally, all that she said; so that I think it must have been very bad. The interest was watching Mrs Webb, seated like an industrious spider at the table; spinning her webs (a pun!â€”) incessantly. The hall was full of earnest drab women, who are thought 'queer' at home, & rejoice in it; & of broad nosed, sallow, shock headed young men, in brown tweed suits. They all looked unhealthy & singular & impotent. The only speech that was worth anything came from Squire, who wears a bright blue shirt & cultivates an amusing appearance. He said it was all very dull & sensible â€” which it was; & the idea that these frail webspinners can affect the destiny of nations seems to me fantastic. But it was well worth going,Â­ & I have now declared myself a Fabian. We stayed in Richmond all day.

We walked up the river, & were startled by the sudden fall of an avalanche of snow from a roof. It was very cold & misty. Jean asked us to go & hear some V.A.D.'s sing; but the fire after tea was too tempting. Oliver & Ray dined with us. Oliver as usual, very prompt impatient & rather testy. Ray solid & capable & soothing. We discussed the war, & Marjorie. ''I cant bear to think of it. Its too revolting'' O. shuddered, after saying that M. must of course live with Jos. as his mistress. Ray says she divides the world into those who are nice enough to be in love with, & those who aren'tâ€”, & Marjorie is'nt. They think her in love â€” but in love too with the drama of the situation. They share our fears too â€” but agree that anything in her case is better than nothing.
