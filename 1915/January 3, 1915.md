### Sunday 3 January

It is strange how old traditions, so long buried as one thinks, suddenly crop up again. At Hyde Park Gate we used to set apart Sunday morning for cleaning the silver table. Here I find myself keeping Sunday morning for odd jobs — typewriting it was today — & tidying the room — & doing accounts which are very complicated this week. I have 3 little bags of coppers, which each owe the other something. We went to a concert at the Queen's Hall, in the afternoon. Considering that my ears have been pure of music for weeks, I think patriotism is a base emotion. By this I mean (I am writing in haste, expecting Fiona to dinner) that they played a national Anthem & a Hymn, & all I could feel was the entire absence of emotion in myself & everyone else. If the British spoke openly about W.C.'s, & copulation, then they might be stirred by universal emotions. As it is, an appeal to feel together is hopelessly muddled by intervening greatcoats & fur coats. I begin to loathe my kind, principally from looking at their faces in the tube. Really, raw red beef & silver herrings give me more pleasure to look upon. But then I was kept standing 40 minutes at Charing X Station, & so got home late, & missed Duncan who came here. Moreover, London on a Sunday night now, with all its electric globes half muddled in blue paint, is the most dismal of places. There are long mid coloured streets, & just enough daylight & insufficient electric light, to see the naked sky, which is inexpressibly cold & flat.
