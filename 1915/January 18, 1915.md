### Monday 18 January

We were still a good deal under the influence of Marjorie this morning. All night (it seemed) people were banging boxes next door. The lodger has got a wife back from New York. This afternoon we went over the houses in Mecklenburgh Sqre; which has led to a long discussion about our future, & a fresh computation of income. The future is dark, which is on the whole, the best thing the future can be, I think. L. went to the Webbs, & I came home — nor has anything happened since to be worth putting down save that, as I began this page, L. stated that he had determined to resign his commission to write a pamphlet about Arbitration— & now I shall stop this diary & discuss that piece of folly with him. It is partly due to my egoistical habit of always talking the argument of my book. I want to see what can be said against all forms of activity & thus dissuade L. from all his work, speaking really not in my own character but in Effie's. Of course it is absolutely essential that L. shd. do a work which may be superbly good.
