### Thursday, 7 January

No â€” we didn't go to the Gordon Sqre party. Leonard got back too late, & it rained; & really, we didn't want to go. The lectures were a great success. One old lady told Leonard that they should consider him a personal friend for life; another said that he was the only gentleman who spoke so that working women could understand. He explained Bills of Exchange & so on for an hour; & then answered questions, which again, were amazingly intelligent. I started off after lunch today, first to go to the Foundling Hospital & ask whether they would let us have Brunswick Square or half the house; then to the Omega to buy Janet a shawl, & then to tea with Janet. Mr Chubb opened the door to me at the Hospital. He was sitting at a writing table in a very warm comfortable room, looking on to the garden; while a clerk drew plans of houses on a very high desk. Mr Chubb is growing fat. He recognised me & became immediately extremely courteous. Brunswick Sqre is already practically let to a retired Ceylon Civil Servant, called Spence, who may however be willing to let the two upper floors, which would suit us very well. I became, of course, possessed with a passion to have Brunswick Square. Mr Chubb, who has infinite leisure, & likes conversation, discussed every possibility. He did not himself admire Adrian's frescoes, but said that most people do. The Ceylon gentleman proposed to cover them with a curtain, being apparently of opinion that they were too good to destroy, though not nice to look upon. He is a bachelor, perhaps rather a crusty bachelor, once Chief of the Colombo Lunatic Asylum â€” At this point a Secretary came in, also excessively polite when he heard my name. ''Mrs Woolf certainly has a very strong claim to the house'' he said. ''And I myself don't think Spence is quite right'' â€” ''I do'' Mr Chubb replied firmly ''I've looked him up in the Medical Directory â€” besides, he seems all right." ''He looks all right certainly'' the secretary agreed, ''but I don't know'â€” However it wouldn't be playing the game to refuse at the eleventh hour." ''The twelfth you may say'' said Mr Chubb. At last I left, shaking hands all round, & having begged Mr Chubb to do his best & let us know. They advised me to see a house in Mecklenburgh Sqre, which I did. It is a vast place, with a great hall, a sweeping staircase; & we could have a flat at the top â€” the only objection being that Grays Inn Road is at the backÂ­ When I got out, it was raining. I walked to the Omega however & bought my stuff from a foolish young woman in a Post Impressionist tunic. I went to Hampstead, found some elderly lady there already, went to the station, in order to avoid tea with Emphie; & then was allowed up to Janet. She is in bed, & will have to stay in bed for weeks. Her nerves are thoroughly wrong. She can't read, or do anything â€” I can guess what she feels like & how miserable she must be very often especially since she is growing old, & Emphie must be wearisome with her repetitions, & general enthusiastic vagueness. & then, the fag end of life â€” Still she is trained to be brave, & so unselfish by nature that other people really interest her. We talked about Leonard, & Lily, & life in London & Hardy's poems which she can't reâ€”read â€” Too melancholy & sordid â€” & the subjects not interesting enough. I don't agree. It grew late; & she suggested that I should dine there & go with L. to the Peace Debate at the Women's Guild. I couldn't face dinner, so I retreated to the Public Library. On the way I walked through one of the worst downpours I have ever been in. It was more like a shower bath than natural rain. My shoes squeaked so with wet as I walked up the Library that I was ashamed. Then I dined at a cabmans eating house â€” the only dining place, & very good. Coarse, but clean & sober. At 8 I met L. at 28 Church Row. The rooms are old white pannelled rooms; one was full of working women. It was a comfort (after reading more terrific letters of childbirth) to see how the women roar with laughter, like schoolgirls. Mr Hobson spoke â€” It was very good Â­ The women impressive as usual â€” because they seem to feel, & to have such a sense of responsibility. Another letter from Mrs Waterlow.
