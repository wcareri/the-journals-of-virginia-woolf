### Friday 1 January

To start this diary rightly, it should begin on the last day of the old year, when, at breakfast, I received a letter from Mrs. Hallett. She said that she had had to dismiss Lily as a moments notice, owing to her misbehavior. We naturally supposed that a certain kind of misbehavior was meant; a married gardener, I hazarded. Our speculations made us both uncomfortable all day. Now this morning I hear from Lily herself. She writes, very calmly, that she left because Mrs. Hallett was 'insulting' to her; having been given a day & nights holiday, she came back at 8:30 a.m. 'not early enough'. What is the truth? This, I guess: Mrs. H. is an old angry woman, meticulous, indeed as we knew tyrannical, about her servants; & Lily honestly meant no wrong. But I have written for particulars â€” another lady wanting a character at once. Then I had to write to Mrs. Waterlow about the chimney sweeping charges foisted on us, such a letter as comes naturally to the strong character, but not to the weak. And then we tramped to the Coâ€”ops. in rain & cold to protest against their bookkeeping. Manager a bored languid young man, repeating rather than defending himself. Half way home we heard "British warship...British warship" & found that the Formidable has been sunk in the channel. We were kept awake last night by New Year Bells. At first I thought they were ringing for a victory.
