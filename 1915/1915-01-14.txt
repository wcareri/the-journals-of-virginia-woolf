### Thursday 14 January

We were woken this morning (I see this is going to become a stock phrase like 'Once upon a Time' in a Faery story) by a thumping throbbing sound as if a motor omnibus were on the roof, endeavouring to start. Experience told now, however, that Lizzy had merely made a huge kitchen fire, when there was no water in the pipes. When L. turned on the tap, steam issued, as if it were Siegfried's dragon at Covent Garden, & then came floating bits of pipe, & the water was rust redâ€” Nobody, however, seemed to think that the boiler might burst. We wrote all the morning. I heard from Adrian, by the way, who has gone into rooms in Cambridge without a single sheet. Now, I begin telephoning & writing about sheets, just as the Waterlows are silent. After lunch, we set off to Kingston in order to buy some charming cups, which are to be had there for 1d each. If Lizzie doesn't go, & continues to behave as though each day were her last, we must give her something cheap to break her rage against. We came home on the top of a bus; making up phrases in the manner & tone of Walter Lamb. Leonard is going up to hear the Fabians discourse; I think I shall indulge in a picture palace but why? I shall certainly come out saying to myself, ''Nothing will induce me ever to go to a picture palace again''. I also heard from Annie, who evidently intends to be our permanent cook, for the excellent reason, I think, that ours is the easiest place in England. The Waterlows say that her young man has removed to â€” or been replaced by one â€“ at Willesden. L's article on diplomacy is to come out on Saturday. He was, of course, convinced after sending it that it would be rejected (this is a note, for future use & quotation).
