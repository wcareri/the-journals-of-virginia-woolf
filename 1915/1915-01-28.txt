Thursday 28 January

Leonard off again to lunch with the Webbs, & have his Committee meeting. Once more I wrote. All these days, I may remark, are semidark, lightening a little about 3 p.m. before their final plunge into darkness; & yet I think even this darkness is the darkness of very early spring, not winter darkness any more. I decided to go to London, for the sake of hearing the Strand roar, which I think one does want, after a day or two of Richmond. Somehow, one can't take Richmond seriously. One has always come here for an outing, I suppose; & that is part of its charm, but one wants serious life sometimes. As I dressed, my watch fell on the floor; & sitting at tea in a shop in the Strand, I found that the hands' pointed to 4:30 still, though it went on ticking. So I took it to Frodsham's, in South Molton Street, where I made great play with the name of McCabe, & the fact that the watch had been over 60 years in my family. Frodsham claims to be the only genuine watchmaker in London: the rest are jewellers. I saw a beautiful woman in the Bus; who could hardly contain her laughter because a great military gentleman was thrown on to her lap, like a sack of coals, which seemed to tickle her greatly, & the more she laughed, the nicer I thought her. About one person in a fortnight seems to me nice — most are nothing at all. Home to find L. triumphant from his Committee meeting. He is to do as he likes: & Squire throws out hints that they would like him to edit the Blue book supplement for them. Well 'I told you so' — A new servant has come today. Lizzy left, carrying a brown paper parcel & whistling loudly — I wonder where she has gone?
