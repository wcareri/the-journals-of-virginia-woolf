### Wednesday 20 January

Having finished a chapter, I went off buying small fragments of things part of the morning— For one thing, I saw a mass of pinkish stuff in the fishmongers, & bought it — Cods' Roe. Then I made carbon copies of some notes of L's about Arbitration. The action of nature has relieved. his spirits more than all the arguments of his wife – also the day was fine. Anyhow one may now hope he will get started, which is the main thing. He went to the School of Economics after lunch; & I to Westminster. I want to see as many houses as possible. But in Barton St. the rent is £130 & that is low, on account of the war. Westminster, noiseless & shadowed by the Abbey is almost the heart of London.

By this time it was raining. I went to Days, & found my books already sent. When I tried to remember the name of one, I failed utterly; so one must feel in an examination. I read Essay upon Criticism waiting for my train at Hammersmith. The classics make the time pass much better than the Pall Mall Gazette. Maynard Keynes came to dinner. We gave him oysters. He is like quicksilver on a sloping board — a little inhuman, but very kindly, as inhuman people are. We gossiped at full speed about Adrian & Karin (Adrian's lovemaking done in loud judicious tones) & of course Marjorie & Jos. Here, though friendly & very amusing, I thought K. a little inhuman. He saw the queerness & the fun, but didn't seem to see that it might be serious. Nessa & Ottoline, he says, contrived the whole thing. Then we talked about the war. We aren't fighting now, he says, but only waiting for the spring. Meantime we lavish money, on a scale which makes the French, who are fearfully out at elbow, gape with admiration. We are bound to win— &  in great style too, having at the last moment applied all our brains & all our wealth to the problem.
