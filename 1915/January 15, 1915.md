### Friday 15 January

I went to my picture palace; & L. to his Fabians; & he thought, on the whole, that his mind & spirit & body would have profited more by the pictures than by the Webbs, & the doctors, who were talking about their etiquette. There were 2 or 3 superb pictures; one of a barge laden with timber floating past Bagdad — another of an eastern palace, overrun with apes & pariah dogs — another of a sunken yatcht. But as usual, the drama is very boring. I wish one liked what everyone likes. The Hall was crowded, roars of laughter, applause &c.

I heard from Emphie Case this morning, who wishes me to find out about the Home at Lewes where Lily had her child — as she knows a young woman who also wants to have a child. I wonder how Emphie comes across these things. Janet much the same.

We walked to Hogarth this afternoon, to see if the noise of schoolchildren is really a drawback. Apparently, it would only affect Suffield. Well — I wonder what we shall do. I'd give a lot to turn over 30 pages or so, & find written down what happens to us. We walked into the Park, & saw Territorials flogging & spurring their carthorses; also a great fallen tree. We are dining early, & going to a Hall — an unheard of dissipation ­ though there was a time when I went out to operas, evenings concerts &c, at least 3 times a week— And I know we shall both feel, when its over, 'really a good read would have been better'. L. continues to read diplomatists; I read about 1860 — the Kembles — Tennyson & so on; to get the spirit of that time, for the sake of The Third Generation. They were immensely scientific — always digging up extinct monsters, & looking at the stars, & trying to find a Religion. At this moment, I feel as if the human race had no character at all — sought for nothing, believed in nothing, & fought only from a dreary sense of duty. I began today to treat my corn. It had to be done for a week.
