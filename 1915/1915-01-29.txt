Friday 29 January

Shall I say ''nothing happened today'' as we used to do in our diaries, when they were beginning to die? It wouldn't be true. The day is rather like a leafless tree: there are all sorts of colours in it, if you look closely. But the outline is bare enough. We worked: after lunch we walked down the river, to that great mediaeval building which juts out into the river Â­ It is I think a vast mill. And we came back early, so that L. might have tea before he went to a Committee at Hatnpstead. After that I bought our food, & did not observe much of interest. But the fact of the day for me has been a vague kind of discomfort, caused by the eccentric character of the new servant Maud. When one speaks to her, she stops dead & looks at the ceiling. She bursts into the room 'just to see if you are there'. She is an angular woman of about 40, who never stays long in any place. I believe she lives in dread of something. She puts down plates with a start. Mrs Le Grys says that she herself is going mad, with Maud's peculiarities. She has just announced that she is the daughter of a Colonel. I am sure her brain is full of illusions, poor creature; & I shouldn't be surprised at anything. The only question is, how she contrives to exist.
