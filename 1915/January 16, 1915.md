### Saturday 16 January

I think the Hall (Coliseum) last night was worth while — in spite of draw backs. What I like in Halls are 'turns' — comic singers, or men imitating Prima Donna's, or Jugglers. I don't like one act plays. It takes me a whole act to get into a play, & so one act plays are mostly sheer boredom. Therefore I was disappointed to have 3 one act plays; one the Barrie Der Tag — sheer balderdash of the thinnest kind about the German Emperor; then a play about a woman who means Parrot when she says Pirate; third Dr Johnson. To begin with Johnson spits bread & butter through his nose to end with he is paternal, sentimental & as tender as a woman — which is of course what he was bound to be on the stage. However, there was a man who sang like a Prima Donna; & a patriotic Revue — people clapped Grey more than anyone. We left, just as an Eastern jar, coloured grey & violet, shot up in the middle of the stage;—& I didn't see my war pictures, but departed mildly as a lamb.

We wrote this morning. L's article by the way reads very well in the New Statesman. I had a request from Adrian for silver, glass, kitchen things. They seem to have set up house without a single article. He wrote by a candle light, stuck in a saucer. L. went to the L. Library; I took Max along the River, but we were a good deal impeded, by a bone he stole, by my suspenders coming down, by a dogfight in which his ear was torn & bled horribly. I thought how happy I was, without any of the excitements which, once, seemed to me to constitute happiness. L. & I argued for some time about this. Also about the worthlessness of all human works except as a means of keeping the workers happy. My writing now delights me solely because I love writing & dont, honestly, care a hang what anyone says. What seas of horror one dives through in order to pick up these pearls — however they are worth it.
