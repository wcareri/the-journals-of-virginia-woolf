I had to go out shopping this morning, so I called in on Chancellors. They say that Mrs Wontner makes conditions about taking on Hogarth, so that 'it is possible that she won't take it-  So here we are on the seesaw again. Mrs Le Grys, also, told me this morning of a house on the Green, 3 doors off, which is to let in March. The rent is £65 & they want £75 premium. We went to look at it after luncheon, but, being a boarding house, couldn't see over it. What we saw was defaced in every possible way; but a nice substantial house, without the charms of Hogarth, but then with the addition of the Green. We went up to London- L. to the London Library: I to Days. I walked with him across the Green Park. In St James Street there was a terrific explosion; people came running out of Clubs; stopped still & gazed about them. But there was no Zeppelin or aeroplane - only, I suppose, a very large tyre burst. But it is really an instinct with me, & most people, I suppose, to turn any sudden noise, or dark object in the sky into an explosion, or a German aeroplane. And it always seems utterly impossible that one should be hurt.

I was annoyed in the usual way at Days by the afternoon party of fashionable ladies, looking for books. We have just been rung up by Chancellors, who wish us to see the owner of Hogarth tomorrow, & possibly by our presence & respectability outwit Mrs Wontner, whose demands have annoyed Chancellors. In fact it seems quite likely at this moment that we shall get Hogarth! I wish it were tomorrow. I am certain it is the best house to take.
