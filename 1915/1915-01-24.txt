### Sunday 24 January

In the middle of dinner last night, Molly rang us up to ask whether she & Desmond might come to lunch today. Oliver exclaimed that Desmond as he happened to know, had promised to lunch with Henry James. We told Molly this. It was news to her. So she came alone, about 12:30. We plunged of course into Gordon Square gossip. She has suffered acutely this winter, owing to a series of embroilments with Clive, the nature of which I can imagine; though whether he got bored first or she disgusted, I don't know. Anyhow, as I could have foretold, after violent scenes lasting almost 18 months, they have parted, & he abuses her, & she abuses herself â€” for ever having listened. But she finds that an intermittent acquaintance wont do for him â€” 'garden party talk' he calls it; & she feels that intimacy in those circles leads to a kind of dustiness of soul. So she has broken, & now takes Desmond off to Freshwater for 9 months, to live cheaply & write a novel. This is the very last attempt & it sounds a little desperate. He is to come up to town once in 6 weeks. She is to manage 3 children & the house with only one servant. And she means never again to come back into the whirl. Moreover they have quarreled with his Mother, & forfeited Â£100 a year; so they must live on Â£350, which includes Desmond's weekly article in the New Statesman. She was incoherent, inattentive, & fragmentary as usual; like a little grey moth among machines. L. went to see his mother; I called on Jean, whom I found sitting in black velvet in a room like a cheap restaurant with brilliant lights. And there was old Mrs Thomas too, knitting incessantly: & we talked about waterpipes & soldiers; & so home, to a quiet evening thank God.
