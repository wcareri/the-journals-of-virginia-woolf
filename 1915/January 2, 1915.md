### Saturday 2 January

This is the kind of day which if it were possible to choose an altogether average sample of our life, I should select. We breakfast; I interview Mrs. Le Grys. She complains of the huge Belgian appetites, & their preference for food fried in butter. "They never give one another" she remarked. The Count, taking Xmas dinner with them, insisted, after Pork & Turkey, that he wanted to a third meat. Therefore Mrs. Le G. hopes that the war will soon be over. If they eat thus in their exile, how must they eat at home, she wonders? After this, L. & I both settle down to our scribbling. He finishes his Folk Story review, & I do about 4 pages of poor Effie's story; we lunch; & read the papers, agree that there is no news. I read Guy Mannering upstairs for 20 minutes; & then we take Max (a dog) for a walk. Halfway up the Bridge, we found ourselves cut off by the river, which rose visible, with a little ebb & flow, like the pulse of a heart. Indeed, the road we had come along was crossed, after 5 minutes, by a stream several inches deep. One of the queer things about the suburbs is that the vilest little red villas are always let, & that not one of them has an open window, or an uncurtained window. I expect that people take a pride in their curtains, & there is great rivalry among neighbors. One house had curtains of yellow silk, striped with lace insertion. The rooms inside must be in semi—darkness; & I supposed rank with the smell of meat & human beings. I believe that being curtained is a mark of respectability — Sophia used to insist upon it. And then I did my marketing. Saturday night is the great buying night; & some counters are besieged by three rows of women. I always choose the empty shops, where I suppose, one pays a lb. more. And then we had tea, & honey & cream; & now L. is typewriting his article, & we shall read all the evening & go to bed.
