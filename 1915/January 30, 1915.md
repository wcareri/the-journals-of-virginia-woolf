### Saturday 30 January

L. went to Chancellors this morning about Hogarth. They now volunteer that Mrs Wontner wishes to stay on — but will let us know on Monday for certain. It is a great nuisance. I have a nose for a house, & that was a perfect house, if ever there was one. We went to Wimbledon this afternoon, on the strength of Savages information that there was a beautiful house there to let. Wimbledon is a dreary, high, bleak, windy suburb, on the edge of a threadbare heath. And Savage's house is an enlarged villa, with a rent of £150, furnished, overlooked by motor omnibuses, standing on the road. In all ways therefore utterly unsuited to us. We came home by Bus; & the world grew steadily nicer as we carne to Richmond. Certainly it is the first of the suburbs by a long way, because it is not an offshoot of London, any more than Oxford or Marlborough is. It was icy cold; I had the grace to remember that many bus conductors are shivering today, but only stabs at my own comfort make me remember other people unlike L. Maud's secret obsession, I believe, is that she is a lady. She attempts genteel talk, about the weather, as a Colonel's daughter very well might, & mutters something when she brings in the coal, about being accustomed to private work, She is certainly cleaner than Lizzie. I hope her mania wont develop. My corn is cured. I cannot get on with Michelet's middle ages. L. has Indian Blue Books to review. He was kept late at Hampstead: didnt get home till 10:15, when we had hot chocolate over the fire. He read Janet 'The Three Jews'.
