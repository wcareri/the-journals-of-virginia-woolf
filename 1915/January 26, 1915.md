### Tuesday 26 January

L. went up to the School of Economics this morning: I wrote, as usual over the fire, with an occasional interruption by Lizzy, who is like a rough coated young carthorse, with muddy hoofs. After lunch, I met L. at the gates of Kew Gardens, & we walked back to Richmond through the Gardens, which are now one feels teeming with buds & bulbs, though not a spike shows. He has already grasped his Arbitration — such is the male mind— & will, I see, go through with it straight off & (here I make my prophesy) it will be a great success, & lead to as much work as he wants. As Molly sighed 'It must be wonderful to have a husband who works!—' I think it would be much odder to have one who didn't— Mrs Woolf & Clara are coming to dinner, so I must stop.
