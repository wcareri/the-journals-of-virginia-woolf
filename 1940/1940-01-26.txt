### Friday 26 January

These moments of despairâ€”I mean glacial suspenseâ€”a painted fly in a glass caseâ€”have given way as they so often do to ecstasy. Is it that I have thrown off those two dead pigeonsâ€”my story, my Gas at Abbotsford (printed today). And so ideas rush in. I began one night, absolutely submerged, throttled, held in a vice with my nose rubbed against Rogerâ€”no way outâ€”all hard as ironâ€”to read Julian. And off winged my mind along those wild uplands. A hint for the future. Always relieve pressure by a flight. Always violently turn the pillow: hack an outlet. Often a trifle does. A review offered of Marie Corelli by the Listener. These are travellers notes which I offer myself shd I again be lost.

I think the last chapter must be sweated from 20 to 10 thousand. This is an attempt at the first words:â€”

â€œTransformations is the title that Roger Fry ~~chose for this~~ gave to last book of essays. And it seems natural enough, looking back at the last ten years of his life, so full to choose it by way of title for them too so full were they of change, ~~so little & also of achievement For They were also full of achievement. His position as a critic was became established His position as a critic was became established~~ They were ~~years not~~ years not of repose & stagnation. ~~They were years of change~~, but of perpetual experiment & new experience. ~~In the course of~~ them His position as a critic became established. â€œAt the time of his deathâ€ writes Howard Hannay, â€œRoger Fryâ€™s position in the English art world was unique, & the only parallel to it is that of Ruskin at the height of his reputation.â€ And the perpetual ~~This was achieved Perpetual speculation. But that position was only his because a room. So he But it was a position that The transformations then, the perpetual revisions of the his left threw out left behind them something that his thought that~~ This perpetual revision of thought in the light of experience, resulted in something But this ~~reputation position depended upon~~ was the result of the freedo ~~of his~~ which ~~he had~~ the ~~energy &~~ the & the vigour with which he carried on his intellectual life; & so closely connected ~~that it impossible to separate them, went the other adventure~~ with which he extended & enlarged his view. ~~And it~~ Nor was he less adventurous in ~~his~~ the other life ~~which after all~~ with ~~which the oth nor is it possible to separate the two~~. And there too, transformations ~~left~~ resulted in ~~what was~~ something permanent, as Sir K Clark says: Although he was remarkably consistent in the main outlines of his beliefs, his mind was invincibly experimental & ready for any adventure, however far it might lead him beyond the boundaries of ~~aesthetic~~ academic tradition.

~~And~~ Physically, the strain was very great. His health had suffered from the long years at the Omega No I cannot reel it off at all. How queer the change is from private writing to public writing. And how exhausting. My little fund of gossip & comment is dried up. What was I going to say? Oh that the lyric mood of the winterâ€”its intense spiritual exaltationâ€”is over. The thaw has set in, & rain & wind, & the marsh is soggy, & patched with white, & two very small lambs were staggering in the east wind. One old ewe was being carted off; & shirking the horror I crept back by the hanger. Nor have I spent a virtuous evening, hacking at these phrases. Iâ€™m enjoying Burke though, & shall tune up on the French Revolution.

Q. last night. Miss Gardner on Federation. She writes short stories; her brother, a slip of a blue bell stalk beside Q.â€™s rosy sun, writes poetry, & is in touch with â€œour groupâ€. We plan printing; indeed L. set up an address this afternoon. Then we hung Nessaâ€™s picture, & it being now 6 oâ€™clock, I shall take a plunge into some current. We go up next week, shall have Tom to dine & go to the new Oâ€™Neil play. No, its useless writing biography between tea & dinner. Better dream.
