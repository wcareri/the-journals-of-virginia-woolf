### Thursday 25 July

Iâ€™m not very nervous at the moment: indeed at worst its only a skin deep nervousness; for after all, the main people approve; still I shall be relieved if Morgan approves. That I suppose I shall know tomorrow. The first review (Lynd.) says: â€œdeep imaginative sympathyâ€¦. makes him an attractive figure (in spite of wild phrases): There is little dramaâ€¦.. at the same time those interested in modern art will find it of absorbing interestâ€¦â€ Then he goes on to mis-quote, having I daresay his whiskey by him.

I shall settle in very happily I think to Coleridge after the splash is over. I expect some letters. But what is true, is that then I can write entirely to please myself: first a C.R: then PH: leaving spaces for odds & ends: for ex: an article for the pressing American lady. Iâ€™m thick in Mme Spiraâ€™s affairs: she sobbed & left her strangled wool gloves behind her. Iâ€™ve heard from Margot & M. Storm Jamesonâ€”oh the bore of being kind! This war inflicts boredom endlessly. My little triumph today was that Flint gave me extra tea. Now margarine is rationed; & I have a horrid skinflint morning ordering dinner, suspecting Louie who of course helps herself to this & that.

What a curious relation is mine with Roger at this momentâ€”I who have given him a kind of shape after his deathâ€”Was he like that? I feel very much in his presence at the moment: as if I were intimately connected with him; as if we together had given birth to this vision of him: a child born of us. Yet he had no power to alter it. And yet for some years it will represent him.
