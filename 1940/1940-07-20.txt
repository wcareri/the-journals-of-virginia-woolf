### Saturday 20 July

Things to write about when Iâ€™m less sleepy (back an hour ago from London). 1. Rayâ€™s death; 2. Talk with Rose Macaulay; 3. Book to come out on 25th; 4. Madame Spira; 5. Lady Oxford: 6. Bella & Tom. I daresay theres a 7th & an 8th. But these headings will remind me, when Iâ€™ve walked & slept off the extreme jadedness of London. 7 might be Jack & Jeremy Hutch to stay the night. 8 the photographs of the womans body in the abortionists cupboard: her dead face: long hair: legs trussed up. 9. Must be Hitlerâ€™s speech yesterday: lets talk common sense & end the warâ€”if not: & instead of any more headings I shall now cool & expand on the marsh. Oh 10 might be my new resolve of tidiness. Desk & table both clear.
