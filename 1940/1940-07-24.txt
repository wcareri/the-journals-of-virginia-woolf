### Wednesday 24 July

Yes those are things to write about; but I want at the moment, the eve of publication moment, to discover my emotions. They are fitful: thus not very strongâ€”nothing like so strong as before The Yearsâ€”oh dear nothing like. Still they twinge. I wish it were this time next week. Thereâ€™ll be Morgan, & Desmond. And I fear Morgan will sayâ€”just enough to show he doesnâ€™t like, but is kind. D. will certainly depress. The Times Lit Sup (after its ill temper about Reviewing) will find chinks. T. & T. will be enthusiastic. Andâ€”thats all. I repeat that 2 strains, as usual will develop: fascinating; dull; life like; dead. So why do I twinge? knowing it almost by heart. But not quite. Mrs Lehâ manâ n enthusiastic: John silent. I shall of course be sneered at by those who sniff at Bloomsbury. Iâ€™d forgotten that. But as L. is combing Sally I cant concentrate. No room of my own. For 11 days Iâ€™ve been contracting in the glare of different faces. It ended yesterday with the W.I.: my talkâ€”it was talked;â€”about the Dreadnought. A simple, on the whole natural, friendly occasion. Cups of tea; biscuits; & Mrs Chavasse, in a tight dress, presiding: out of respect for me, it was a Book tea. Miss Gardner had 3 Gs. pinned to her frock; Mrs Thompsett 3 weeks: & someone else a silver spoon.

No I cant go on to Rayâ€™s death, about which I know nothing, save that that very large woman, with the shock of grey hair, & the bruised lip; that monster, whom I remember typical of young womanhood, has suddenly gone. She had a kind of representative quality, in her white coat & trousers; wall building, disappointed, courageous, without what? imagination?

Lady Oxford said that there was no virtue in saving; more in spending. She hung over my neck in a spasm of tears. Mrs Campbell has cancer. But in a twinkling she recovered & began to spend. A cold chicken she said was always under cover on the sideboard at my service. The country people send butter. She was beautifully dressed in a rayed silk, with a dark blue tie; a dark blue fluted Russian cap with a red flap. This was given her by her milliner: the fruit of spending. All the walls, the protecting & reflecting walls, wear so terribly thin in this war. Thereâ€™s no standard to write for: no public to echo back: even the â€˜traditionâ€™ has become transparent. Hence a certain energy & recklessnessâ€”part goodâ€”part bad I daresay. But its the only line to take. And perhaps the walls, if violently beaten against, will finally contain me.

I feel tonight still veiled. The veil will be lifted tomorrow, when my book comes out. Thats what may be painful: may be cordial. And then I may feel once more round me the wall Iâ€™ve missedâ€”or vacancy? or chill?

I make these notes, but am tired of notesâ€”tire of Gide, tired of de Vigny notebooks. I want something sequacious now & robust. In the first days of the war I cd read notes only.

Rayâ€™s hair stood up very vigorously on either side of the parting which lately she had made in the middle. Her bitterness at Oliver, whom she had loved, & did love, was perceptibleâ€”something tart about her; & as if some of the petals of what she hoped, as a girl, to be so yellow a sunflowerâ€”she was ambitious, self confident, was greedy & a little insensitive about â€˜fameâ€™â€”as if these petals had withered & she cd. no longer be confident; was indeed disappointed, a little wounded, embittered; chiefly shown by her immense activity, as if always trying to get what she could not. And she grew so unwieldy; & cared so little for appearances; yet was envious, I guess, of the graces; & hadnt achieved altogether what her intention in disregarding the graces had been. I mean, she planned a great unconventional rough hewn figure; & it didnt altogether come off. She played patience endlessly. She had educated her children so carefully. Yet look what failures they both are. Christopher unimaginative; Barbaraâ€”oh, well she ran off the rails completely: B. was bitter against intellectâ€”which Ray reverenced: yet had no aesthetic sense. What else? Her humanity: offered to help when I was ill. Her competence. Her good nature. Her wisdomâ€”yes, as she grew older, it was there. Perhaps at 70 she wd have created the legend ofâ€”the wise matriarch: have been surrounded, & central. But she died while it was in the rough, aged 53. Also a kind of rough radiance. Corpulent. Yet keen. Bright eyed. But I never knew her domestically. Always something of the officeâ€”documents, overalls, interviewsâ€”about her. One of the people who was â€˜in loveâ€™ in the old way. Oliverâ€™s letter asking her to see over some factory made her flush, at Firle in my little dining room. She tore it to scraps I think. So Iâ€™ve written higgledypiggledy, about Ray. Her cordialityâ€”& queer little quick voice: smoking: it used to be a pipe. Initiative but no charm. Wrote without stopping. No form, no fineness. Her life much of a scramble & a fight: but in the office I guess very commanding, controlling & masterly.
