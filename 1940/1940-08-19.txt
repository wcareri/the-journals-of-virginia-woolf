### Monday 19 August

Yesterday, 18th, Sunday, there was a roar. Right on top of us they came. I looked at the plane, like a minnow at a roaring shark. Over they flashedâ€”3, I think. Olive green. Then pop pop popâ€”German? Again pop pop pop, over Kingston. Said to be 5 Bombers hedge hopping on their way to London. The closest shave so far. 144 brought downâ€”no that was last time. And no raid (so far) today. Rehearsal. I cannot read Remorse. Why not say so?
