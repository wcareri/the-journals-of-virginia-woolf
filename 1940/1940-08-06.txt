Yes I was very happy again when I saw Cliveâ€™s blue envelope at breakfast (with John) this morning. Its Clive almostâ€”what?â€”devoutâ€”no quiet, serious, completely without sneer approving. As good in its way as the best of my booksâ€”the best biography for many yearsâ€”The first part as good as the last & no break. So Iâ€™m confirmed in what I felt, even when I had that beak pecking walk in March with a temperature of 101 with Leonardâ€”confirmed in what I feelâ€”that the first part is really more generally interesting, though less complex & intensified than the last. Iâ€™m sure it was necessaryâ€”as a solid pavement for the whole to stand on. So Iâ€™m really & truly immune, & feel, if only Louieâ€™s father hadnt died, & Mabelâ€™s lover hadnt gone to hospital so that Iâ€™ve all the cooking & washing up to do today, that I could go on to the next thingâ€”to many next things. Is it an illusion that Iâ€™m freer & stronger, as a writer, than ever? Only now John persistently presses for my LT article; & the American ladyâ€”one never is free for more than a dogs chain length.

Men excavating gun emplacements in the bank. They look like little swarms of busy ants, as I walk. Cementing floors; sand bagging walls. Great lorries of material go bursting down the Roman Road. No one pays any attentionâ€”so blasÃ© are we. Guns along the river, boughs for camouflage, excite no one. Its like the raising of the gallows tree, for an execution now expected in a week or fortnight. R. sells well. Talk of reprint.
