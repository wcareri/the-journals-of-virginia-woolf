### Monday 16 December

Exhausted with the long struggle of writing 2,000 about Ellen Terry,â€”interrupted by 4 days of furniture movingâ€”distracted by the chaotic state of our possessionsâ€”oh the huddle & hideousness of untidinessâ€”oh that Hitler had obliterated all our books tables carpets & picturesâ€”oh that we were empty & bare & unpossessedâ€”I take my pen to drawl & drowse a little. The year draws to an end; & I am harassed, damp: but I am relieved of a visit from Margot; & so will take the matter in hand: scrub & polish & discard: & make our life here as taut & bright & vigorous as it can be.

Its rather a hard lap: the winter lap. So cold often. And so much work to do. And so little fat to cook with. And so much shopping to do. And one has to weigh & measure. Then Kingsley comes & devours sugar & butter. I will write memoirs, I think: then Reading at Random. Measure, order, precision are now my gods. Even my hand shakes. We have the kitten. One day last week we lunched at Kings Cross with John. He was polite impersonalâ€”the Prince Consort. A ceremonious lunch. Why are we hooked to that large, rather pretentious livid bellied shark? And must I spend my last years feeding his double row of teeth? I forget. I forget what I wished to say.

K.M. effusive but less distasteful. He ruined 2 days, now I come to think of it. The sensitive plate of his mind only takes the surface. Yes, its like going to the filmsâ€”the film of December 1940 talking to Kingsley. He reels off Bob Boothby: shelters; air raids; politics; not composed, but fluent. I sit with my eyes dazed. Then at meals he scrapes & sops. I cook in the damp kitchen. And the village keeps tugging & jogging. The W I. party tomorrow. My old dislike of the village bites at me. I envy houses alone in the fields. So petty so teasing are the claims of Gardners & Chavasses. I dont likeâ€”but here I stop. Italy is being crushed. Laval dismissed. No raids lately. Margot asks me to lunch & has left me Voltaire in her will.
