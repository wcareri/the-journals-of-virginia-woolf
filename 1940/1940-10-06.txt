### Sunday 6 October

I snatch this page with Anreps & Ruth Beresford imminent to sayâ€”what? Will it ever seem strange that L. & I walking on the marsh first look at a bomb crater: then listen to the German drone above: then I take 2 paces nearer L., prudently deciding that 2 birds had better be killed with one stone? They got Lewes at last yesterday. Eleven bombs Percy saysâ€”not one of em drawing blood; only sheds, graveyards & windows. We discount Percy. But its indisputableâ€”the crater in the field by the line. Two or three crashes today. A very stormy huddled clouded day. Favourable for hiding planes. Wild geese on the river. So I say. L. says Cormorants. But my old St Ives sea sense scouts that.

Iâ€™m earning Â£30 this week. 2 Coleridges; Sitwells. And cant help running them all into a book, in & out, round & round I shall thread a necklace through English life & lit. But no, I wont let myself reel it off. Never had a better writing season. P.H. in fact pleases me; & so little to do now. Many letters to write. Lord Bicester introduces the Morgans, who are deeply distressed by Roger. But I cant write with Anreps imminent. Praise be, they go tomorrow. Yet I like Babaâ€”perking up so fresh & spouting through that crooked spout her nose: alive; foolish. Helen of course,â€”well, I dont like the suppliant; yet cant see how she cd. better it. The weak are the wrong doers, as old Waller once said. The drifters that foul the nets. Onlyâ€”onlyâ€”I see too many sides now, growing old. Whats she to do, being a drifter? Vita on Wednesday. I think I could stuff this holeâ€”oh the Anrepsâ€”as I cant bowl in this galeâ€”with Michelet. Iâ€™m tired of article writing.
