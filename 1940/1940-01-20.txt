I think it would be better to read quietly some severe classic, & not make up some ranting rhymes, this bitter cold night. Smoking cigarettes over the fire & feelingâ€”just because the rent of 37 is so highâ€”that we were, for once, foolish. Then L. went & skated & I walked on the bank & home over the marsh. The beauty was etherial, unreal, empty. A June day. 10 degrees of frost. All silent, as if offered from another world. No birds, no carts, men shooting. This specimen against the war. This heartless & perfect beauty. The willows ruby red, no rust red; plumed; soft; & all the roofs orange & red; & the hills white. But some emptiness in meâ€”in my lifeâ€”because L. said the rent was so high. And then the silence, the pure disembodied silence, in which the perfect specimen was presented; seemed to correspond to my own vacancy, walking muffled with the sun in my eyes, & nothing pressing urging only this iron hard, ground, all painted. The men were waiting for widgeonâ€”the quickest birds. Come down like an express. We sat in the sun on the bank. All looked very distant, & picked outâ€”the little stems of smokeâ€”the wild duckâ€”the horses huddled & still. No thoughts populated; I was somehow held in a pair of pincers, & came home to cook crumpets to revise my article; & all the words seem bodiless too. So what about a severe classic?

A fire at Charleston. Fire Engines called out on Wednesday night. No letters. Reaction after London? And Roger reeling off my fingers. And the future. I must tuck myself in with work. A child crying in the school. What do I do to help? But in fact, these are the moments for compacting; for living: unless oneâ€™s to blow out; which I entirely refuse to do.
