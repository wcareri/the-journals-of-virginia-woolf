### Thursday 13 June

I should love to see youâ€”would you be in &câ€”Elizabeth. Let that abstract of this mornings postcard be a reminder & a warning about mares nests & jumping to conclusions & feeling in ones bonesâ€”not but what I had some justification. If it werent forâ€”oh dear the retreatâ€”Paris now almost besiegedâ€”20,000 of our men cut offâ€”still the Fr. have gained 5 miles somewhereâ€”if it werent for thisâ€”today wd have been a happy day. Elizabeth to begin with, which warmed & consoled, for if oneâ€™s friends are to die in the flesh now, whats left?â€”Then Dottyâ€™s Yeats book with her praise of Virginia; then the milkman with 400 eggs for sale. We have bought two great crocks & glass water, or whats it called. My Index sent offâ€”so thats the very final full stop to all that drudgery. John rang up yesterday to say heâ€™s been offered a job at India Office, wh., foreboding as it does Mrs N. & Miss H. here, if evacuated, greatly increased my private gloom. Indeed, after weâ€™d heard Haw-Haw, objectively announcing defeatâ€”victory on his side of the line that isâ€”again & again, left us about as down as weâ€™ve yet been. We sat silent in the 9 oâ€™clock dusk; & L. could only with difficulty read Austen Chamberlain. I found the Wordsworth letters my only drug. Yet today weâ€™re again publicly more cheerful. Why? Up & downâ€”up & down. No petrol at the pumpsâ€”providing for Invasion, only served a dribble, the man said.
