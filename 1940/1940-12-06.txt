And then what they call real life broke in. Vans arrived in a deluge. Oh, we unpacked standing in the rain. And the Bottens did the dirty on us. Result: MH. gorged with old jugs & lidless pots. And the Christian room laden with 4 tons of old damp books. Real life is a helter skelter, healthy for the mind doubtless. I cant climb up to the other life in a hurry. I see what a working womans life is. No time to think. A breeze ruffles the surface. No silence. I cannot concentrate upon E. Terry partly because Iâ€™m not sure of my audience in Harperâ€™s.

Quentin last night; urbane & happy. Fears told us the story of South African warâ€”war seen from the ground by the private. A childs eye view. Rather depressingâ€”old papers, letters, notebooks: Iâ€™m going to bind the survivors tonight; & in coloured paper they may refresh my eye. All this writingâ€”what a deluge of words Iâ€™ve let looseâ€”on paper only: I mean not printed. And must now climb a low rungâ€”Trevyâ€”up towards my heights.
