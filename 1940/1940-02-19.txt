### Monday 19 February

I may as well make a note I say to myself; thinking sometimes whoâ€™s going to read all this scribble? I think one day I may brew a tiny ingot out of itâ€”in my memoirs. Lytton is hinted as my next task by the way. And 3 Gs a dead failure in USA: but enough. I was going to write about Sally.

The snow came down on Saturday: thick white cake sugar all over the garden, blowing into my room in the night: door hinge frozen. She arrived battered, carrying her case, how unlike John, up from Southease; left this morning. And oh to be aloneâ€”after 5 nights talkâ€”A very nice young woman, with a brain; a magpie I called her: has picked up so many facts: & adds objective facts: about cars, pumps, politics. Thats her line. Not art: thoâ€™ she struck me by her dispraise of the neo Corns; & her respect for the artistâ€”Sitwells for instance. A lunch & tea at Charleston. â€œBlow your noseâ€ said Clive. Snow falling. Talkâ€”gossip: Robert Graves has left Laura; Anreps; Anâ â a left debts to be paid by Sally; Nessa feeding hens; gave us 6 new eggs. Duncan asked us to buy cigarettes, wh. I did standing in the snow. Political argument about USA & Ireland between Q., Clive, & Sally. Her real nameâ€™s Elizabeth. Angelica silent, not disapproving. Sally (dog) kissed Leonard. L. smiled at me. Talk about Hugh W. about Eddy Devonshireâ€”aboutâ€”I suppose mostly gossip, with some extravagance, about Frys, & poor Helenâ€™s autopsyâ€”brain pressed by a boneâ€”contributed by me. London adventures. Saxon by the way wrote to thank me. Home to cook turkeyâ€”tough.

Now the thaw has come: L. has his barometer: explains it to me. Walk over Mount Misery. Snow still thick, but the cart tracks run with rivulets. Snow cleared half way to Knotts Bushes. A dim wet ordinary spring winter day. Snowdrops on the graves. L. lent Connolly a pound. Turned in to the Army by Botten.

So Sally went, & kissed me, being a warm hearted woman, rather valiant, & free minded. Whatâ€™ll become of her? Oh & my new coat, the blue striped one, came, & its not too loud: Iâ€™m pleased. And so the week starts again; & I must send offâ€”oh I cant defer itâ€”Roger to M.
