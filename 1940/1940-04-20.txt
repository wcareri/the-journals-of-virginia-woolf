### Saturday 20 April

Desmond to dinner. London week. Talk went like this: â€œYoure the spit of Sydney Smithâ€”â€ He said he wanted streets not country. â€œMust have the muddy London streetsâ€”So S.S. said. Oh & thereâ€™s so much to talk about. And let me see your fathers shabby old booksâ€”Now (at dinner) a few leading questions â€¦ about the war. I have a plan for giving Gâ . everything, everything: but no arms. We must see to that. And is it impossible? â€¦ Then, I must tell youâ€”Iâ€™ve told several peopleâ€”of my revelation. I was reading the Hesperidesâ€”the smutty bitsâ€”when a voice said August 16th Armistice day â€¦ But which August? And I wasnt excited. It was an outer voice. I was thinking of Herrickâ€¦.â€ After dinner,â€”â€œMichael in an unhappy state. No sense of comfort. Cant love a silly cocktail woman, nor live with a rough woman â€¦ The women Iâ€™ve loved never cared for clothes. I like quizzy cats. Why all this larding? Even Rachel has a silly row of curls. You wdnt dream of painting your face. Diana, after a time, I found in spite of her esquimaux trousers & pearlsâ€”oh how ridiculous she looked meeting me at the stationâ€”sheâ€™s humble. Roger â€¦ a very dull letter writer. Iâ€™m very curious to read yr book. Itâ€™ll be such an odd book. I saw him in Trinity Great Court. Thats R.F. said Eddy Marsh. A gigantic intellect. Its too hot to talk to a man with that intellect â€¦ Molly is a lady. Desmond says all the same she enjoys my coarse stories. Iâ€™m writing Desmond Mâ 'â s Dictionary. Its my autobiography. Under M. marriage, moneyâ€”easier for a short winded writer than a book â€¦ One loses the power of sequence with age. Cant prolong an emotion. The senile forget at once. My daughter dead? (weeps) but why dâ€™you give me marmalade for tea? I only like it at breakfast â€¦ Iâ€™m noting every stage of old age. Its this lack of intensity the young mind in us. Certain gifts are sucked by age â€¦ The Sunday Times has cut me down Â£250. And my mother only left 11,000. I gave Dâ . & Mâ . each Â£1000. So Iâ€™m about square. But cd I afford to buy a house in Lewes? Molly wants to have a very nice tidy home. I dont mind squalor. Then I shd have a room in Londonâ€”a cup of tea sent up, like Morgan â€¦ The young can describe passing thingsâ€”a bridge seen from the train. No. One doesnt remember them. We read Tolstoy. I kept Dosâ toevsâ ky to myself in my selfish way. They read Jane Austenâ€”Eddie cd say what Mr Woodhouse did on Wednesday. Thats odd about Hugh Walpoleâ€”Spender ought to tell us more about Inezâ€”everything or nothing. The idea of being perfectly frank with the publicâ€”When is Moore coming? Ask him to stay an extra day. Iâ€™ll mark that week endâ€”May 18th in my book. Juliet Duff gave it meâ€”gives me one every year. Oh Iâ€™ve stayed so lateâ€”Â¼ to 1â€¦â€

And we had Sybil & Herbert Woolf. And came back yesterday. I remember Clive saying how he was the only person who felt uncomfortable when a singer had a flybutton undone. I had meant to note some such fragments; but the talk has rattled me.

A stuffy evening. News suspended. Herbert Fisher dead. Sybil saw him the day beforeâ€”of course.
