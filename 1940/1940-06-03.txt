Leonard said, after Miss Griffiths went, â€œIf it gives them so much happiness, we ought to put up with it from time to timeâ€. I said, But how, seeing she never spoke & was as unresponsive as a fish, could it have given her pleasure? â€œShe leads such an awful life in Acton. She likes the food & sitting in a garden.â€ This fairly sums up a very laboured week end; when we drew bucket up after bucket & nothing happened. Acton is noisy. She lives with an Aunt and a grandmother who forgets things, & they have gas. But we made her sing, Monteverdi: & she sang quite simply. Will she marry? or fade? Again Iâ€™m struck with the helplessness of the lower orders. All of us on top. What can they get atâ€”? Louie said this morning â€œThe Duke of Northumberland has been killedâ€. I had a sense of a very heavy tree fallen. A young man so loaded with everything to be lopped. A kind of crash it seemed, for a duke to fall, compared with a Harry West. I was woken by a great boom rattling my windows. Listened for another; none came. But 2 bombs were dropped â€œin Sussexâ€. Buttercups & sorrel week endâ€”the very flush of the first summer. May still in but bruised: a tossing wind today; none yesterday. Poor little Griffiths looking at the evening. So quiet after Acton.

Nessa & Duncan & Q. over on Saturday. We discussed Helen. D. said, Sheâ€™s not intimate enoâ€™ with you to be honest about money. Then A. & B.â€”how discreet! D. can only say to him Pass the saltâ€”He would not begin upon his anger, as I expressed mine. Nessa said, One must look on the good side. She might have loved an airman. She has an odd streak of luck. Then the weekend descended. Iâ€™ve just only just been beaten at bowls. Breakfast was at 7.30. And this time tomorrow shall I or not be having cocktails with Colefax? I think so yes: in order to discipline myself. Only clothes? gloves? stockings? 4 5ths of the army over here now. A respite, a pause, perhaps. Perhaps Italy comes in â€¦ Then what about Roger? No proofs. We have now been hard at it hero-making. The laughing, heroic, Tommyâ€”how can we be worthy of such men?â€”every paper, every BBC rises to that dreary false cheery hero-making strain. Will they be grinding organs in the street in 6 months? Its the emotional falsity; not all false; yet inspired with some eye to the main chance. So the politicians mate guns & tanks. No. Its the myth making stage of the war weâ€™re in. â€œPlease, no lettersâ€ I read this twice in the Times Deaths column from parents of dead officers.
