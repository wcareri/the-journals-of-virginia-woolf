A curious letter from Hugh this afternoon, part of which I will copy, for I like reading old letters.

â€œAs to my book (I wrote about Roman Fountain) of course I knew that you would dislike some of it very much, but hoped you wd like some which apparently you do. MacCarthy speaks to me as to a child, so does Harold N. talking of my babyish love of my toys in the D.Tâ€¦. But do you care to hear the truth? Half of me is very mature, half has never grown up at all. I cant help my excitement which irritates you all. I never had anything when I was young (cant read). As to my writing you & I are the opposite ends of the bloody stick? You are the supreme example of the aesthetic-conscienceâ€”there has never been such another in English fiction. But you dont write novels. What you write needs a new name. I am the true novelistâ€”a minor one but a true one. I know a lot about the novel & a lot about life seen from my very twisted child-haunted angle. Had I been normal I might have been a major novelist. As it is I am a Siamese twinâ€¦â€

No I cant be bothered to copy any more. It rushes up into a Bengal light spirit of self-glorificationâ€”crocuses, sausages, Harold & chessâ€”at the end, & skirts all the thorns & all the truth as usual. What Desmond said was he hasnt a â€œrareâ€ mind â€¦ Dear dear, Iâ€™ve no mind to add my own comment.

John rings up to ask if he may bring a friendâ€”a London friendâ€”to lunch tomorrow. Then shall we ask Nessa to bring Helen to meet Margery? And thereâ€™s London on Monday â€¦ And Iâ€™m half inclined to kick my heels & despatch R. to the printer; & get rid of my artistic conscience. Ignorance was the begetter of that conscience. When I wrote TLS articles & knew nothing I slaved to make every sentence do instead of accuracy. How oneâ€™s mind interests one! A mercy, seeing its a wild tempest of a day: no outing; rain lashing & streaking the windows. Lottie & Grace over. A great flirt with Percy & presents of tomatoes & plants. And yesterday old Botten faded out under the eyes of Mrs West whoâ€™s layer out & night watcher to the village. A frail old man; the last of the old villagersâ€”save Dedmanâ€”talking the melodious Sussex, sprinkled with words like â€˜nardâ€™ for shoulder, wily & sly & grasping; yet poetic too. And a bore. Bringing the milk heâ€™d stay talking, so we always cut at the sight of him. Like a pollard willow grey greaved moss grown to look atâ€”a tree I mean with very small shrivelled grey leaves.

And what else to fill the page! Such a batter at the window. The effect of the war on weather. Shall I listen in, & rake some music my way instead of raking my mind? No, I will not look at R. again.
