### Sunday 29 September

A bomb dropped so close I cursed L. for slamming the window. I was writing to Hugh, & the pen jumped from my fingers. Raid still on. Its like a sheep dog, chasing a fox out of the foldâ€”you see them yapping & biting & then the marauder, dropping a bone, a bomb towards Newhaven, flies. All Clear. Bowls. Villagers at their doors. Cold. All now become familiar. I was thinking: (among other things) that this is a lazy life. Breakfast in bed. Read in bed. Bath. Order dinner. Out to Lodge. After rearranging my room (turning table to get the sun: Church on right; window left; a new very lovely view) tune up, with cigarette: write till 12; stop; visit L.: look at papers; return; type till 1. Listen in. Lunch. Sore jaw. Cant bite. Read papers. Walk to Southease. Back 3. Gather & arrange apples. Tea. Write a letter. Bowls. Type again. Read Michelet & write here. Cook dinner. Music. Embroidery. 9.30 read (or sleep) till 11.30. Bed. Compare with the old London day. Three afternoons someone coming. One night, dinner party. Saturday a walk. Thursday shopping. Tuesday going to tea with Nessa. One City walk. Telephone ringing. L. to meetings. KM. or Robson botheringâ€”that was an average week; with Friday to Monday here.

I think, now weâ€™re marooned, I ought to cram in a little more reading. Yet why? A happy, a very free, & disengagedâ€”a life that rings from one simple melody to another. Yes; why not enjoy this after all those years of the other? Yet I compare with Miss Perkins day. At 58 Miss P. may live as I do.

Anreps yesterday. Easy & familiar & friendly. The brats astonishingly rude to Helen, to whom therefore I relented. Both treat her as a menial, a servant, an imbecile. Both very callow, callous, rattling & over emphaticâ€”unrestrained; embryos, unlicked cubs. Ba goes to the pub at night. Ba attacked Phoebe Poole. She wants to go back to London. An undisciplined, unschooled & not very attractive or seductive mind. Crude & raw. Both of course youngâ€”& so have vitality. Helen their slave.

Nessa rang up. A statue & frigidaire alone salved.
