### Monday 23 May

I admit to some content, some closing of a chapter, & peace that comes with it, from posting my proofs today: I admitâ€”because weâ€™re in the 3rd day of â€œthe greatest battle in history.â€ It began (here) with the 8 oclock wireless announcing, as I lay half asleep, the invasion of Holland & Belgium. The third day of the Battle of Waterloo. Apple blossom snowing the garden. A bowl lost in the pond. Churchill exhorting all men to stand together. â€œI have nothing to offer but blood & tears & sweatâ€. These vast formless shapes further circulate. They arenâ€™t substances; but they make everything else minute. Duncan saw an air battle over Charlestonâ€”a silver pencil & a puff of smoke. Percy has seen the wounded arriving in their boots. So my little moment of peace comes in a yawning hollow. But though L. says he has petrol in the garage for suicide shd. Hitler win, we go on. Its the vastness, & the smallness, that make this possible. So intense are my feelings (about Roger): yet the circumference (the war) seems to make a hoop round them. No, I cant get the odd incongruity of feeling intensely & at the same time knowing that thereâ€™s no importance in that feeling. Or is there, as I sometimes think, more importance than ever?

Basket given us by the WEAâ€”then G. & Annie. A horrid little scrub called Lee wastes a morning, about Curtis. Q. & Eth Watson dine. And we have Desmond & Moore this week end. I made buns for tea todayâ€”a sign my thralldom to proofs (galleys) is over.
