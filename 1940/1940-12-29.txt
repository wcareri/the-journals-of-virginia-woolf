### Sunday 29 December

There are moments when the sail flaps. Then, being a great amateur of the art of life, determined to suck my orange, off, like a wasp if the blossom Iâ€™m on fades, & it did yesterdayâ€”I ride across the downs to the Cliffs. A roll of barbed wire is hooped on the edge. I rubbed my mind brisk along the Newhaven road. Shabby old maids buying groceries, in that desert road with the villas; in the wet. And Newhaven gashed. But tire the body & the mind sleeps. All desire to write diary here has flagged. What is the right antidote? I must sniff round. I think Mme de SevignÃ©. Writing to be a daily pleasure. Charleston dumb; Leslie vocal. Anreps lunched. I detest the hardness of old ageâ€”I feel it. I rasp. Iâ€™m tart.

The foot less prompt to meet the morning dew,  
The heart less bounding at emotion new,  
And hope, once crushâ€™d, less quick to spring again.

I actually opened Matthew Arnold & copied these lines. While doing so, the idea came to me that why I dislike, & like, so many things idiosyncratically now, is because of my growing detachment from the hierarchy, the patriarchy. When Desmond praises East Coker, & I am jealous, I walk over the marsh saying, I am I; & must follow that furrow, not copy another. That is the only justification for my writing & living.

How one enjoys food now: I make up imaginary meals.
