But hope revivesâ€”I dont know why. A desperate battle. The allies holding. How sick one gets of the phraseâ€”how easy to make a Duff Cooper speech, about valour, & history, where one knows the end of the sentence. Still it cheers, somehow. Poetry as Tom said is easier to write than prose. I cd reel off patriotic speeches, by the dozen. L. has been in London. A great thunderstorm. I was walking on the marsh & thought it was the guns on the channel ports. Then, as they swerved, I conceived a raid on London; turned on the wireless; heard some prattler; & then the guns began to lighten: then it rained. Mrs Dedman off north for the duration. We had our First Aid meeting. Miss Emery English country spinsterhood at its best: sturdy, yet conciliatory, lucid, humorous, with a bar of medal tabs. Everything spaced, brief & clear. L. said the English genius for unofficial organisation. All about the Water Co. & the tap & the Rectory sculleryâ€”very tactful too. Mrs Hubbard, like a great turkey cock, head of the committee. Hubbard limping outside. Then the plays rehearsed here yesterday. My contribution to the war is the sacrifice of pleasure: Iâ€™m bored: bored & appalled by the readymade commonplaceness of these plays: which they cant act unless we help. I mean, the minds so cheap, compared with ours, like a bad novelâ€”thats my contributionâ€”to have my mind smeared by the village & WEA mind; & to endure it, & the simper. But this is to be qualifiedâ€”only theres Miss Griffiths coming for the weekendâ€”all simper & qualification. So, if Margaret Ll. Davies says, how insolent we middleclass women are, I argue, why cant the workers then reject us? Whats wrong is the conventionalityâ€”not the coarseness. So that its all lulled & dulled. The very opposite of â€œcommonâ€ or working class.

Began P.H again today, & threshed & threshed till perhaps a little grain can be collected. I sent off my Walpole too. After dinner I began Sidney Smith; plan being to keep short flights going: P.H. in between. Oh yesâ€”one cant plan, any more, a long book. H. Brace cable that they accept Rogerâ€”whom, which, Iâ€™d almost forgotten. So thats a success; where Iâ€™d been expecting failure. It cant be so bad as all that. 250 advance. But we shall I suppose certainly postpone. Reading masses of Coleridge & Wordsworth letters of a nightâ€”curiously untwisting & burrowing into that plaited nest. Withers Green cant sleep for thinking of raids. No news of Louieâ€™s brother. Rumours about Gwynâ€™s wounds & Col. Westmacott. Theyâ€™re fully furbished in 5 minutes. Rainâ€”& purple & now its overâ€”clear over Caburn & the birds shouting. A rill of soundâ€”a flutter of ribandsâ€”no continuity or connection with each other. Reading Thomas Aâ€™Quinas by Chesterton. His skittish over ingenious mind makes one shy (like a horse). Not straightforward, but has a good engine in his head. I want to send out parachutes into these remote placesâ€”I cant find the word I want.â€”prospectors, perhaps?
