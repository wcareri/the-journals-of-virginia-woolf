Heard the whistle of bombs for the first time today. About 5â€”windy cloudy: playing bowls. Suddenly heard a plane: suddenly heard a whistle. Like a toy pig escapingâ€”rather: Then I saw smoke, over the field path. Then 4 separate thudsâ€”said to be at Iford & by the new house opposite Northease. Went into village. What about the children, said Annieâ€™s sister in law. Then Annie & two children appeared. In the bus from Lewes they had seen the bombs fall near. No one hurtâ€”as far as known. L. now holding agricultural meeting. How instinctive the mothers reaction is! The children â€¦ off she ran. Jaded with story spinning fr. an empty well in reply to 2 more letters from Hâ .B.
