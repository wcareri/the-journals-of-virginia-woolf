Churchill has just spoken. A clear, measured, robust speech. Says the invasion is being prepared. Its for the next 2 weeks apparently if at all. Ships & barges massing at French ports. The bombing of London of course preparatory to invasion. Our majestic cityâ€”&c. which touches me, for I feel London majestic. Our courage &c. Another raid last night on London. Time bomb struck the Palace. John rang up. He was in Meck. Sqre the night of the raid. Wants the press moved at once. L. is to go up on Friday. Our windows are broken John says. He is lodging out somewhere. Meck. Sqre evacuated. A plane shot down before our eyes just before tea: over the race course; a scuffle; a swerve: then a plunge; & a burst of thick black smoke. Percy says the pilot baled out. We count now on an air raid about 8.30. Anyhow, whether or not, we hear the sinister sawing noise about then, which loudens & fades; then a pause; then another comes. â€œTheyre at it againâ€ we say as we sit, I doing my work, L. making cigarettes. Now & then theres a thud. The windows shake. So we know London is raided again.

I decided today after tears from Mable (about L. & the electricityâ€”the latest of many grievances) that she must go. She saidâ€”oh the usual thingsâ€”about not giving him satisfaction; too nervous to speak to him. The poor tallow fleshed almost petrified woman; who can smile thoâ€™, & is unselfish (to me) but its no good.
