An appeal last night for home defenceâ€”against parachutists. L. says heâ€™ll join. An acid conversation. Our nerves are harassedâ€”mine at least: L. evidently relieved by the chance of doing something. Gun & uniform to me slightly ridiculous. Behind that the strain: this morning we discussed suicide if Hitler lands. Jews beaten up. What point in waiting? Better shut the garage doors. This a sensible, rather matter of fact talk. Then he wrote letters, & I too: thanked Bernard Shaw for his love letter. Copied my lecture contentedly. A thunderous hot day. Dutch laid down arms last night. The great battle now raging. Ten days, we say, will settle it. I guess we hold: then dig in; about Nov. the USA comes in as arbitrator. On the other handâ€”

Mabel just come. She says theyre building wooden bridges beside the others on the Thames. Pop-pop-pop, as we play bowls. Probably a raider over Eastbourne way. Now thunder rain sets in. L. & Pâ  discussing Miss Emeryâ€™s fruit. John wishes weâ€™d come up. Mr Pritchard (the old one) dead at last. No, I dont want the garage to see the end of me. Iâ€™ve a wish for 10 years more, & to write my book wh. as usual darts into my brain. L. finished his yesterday. So weâ€™ve cleared up our book accountsâ€”thoâ€™ its doubtful if we shall publish this June. Why am I optimistic? Or rather not either way? because its all bombast, this war. One old lady pinning on her cap has more reality. So if one dies, itâ€™ll be a common sense, dull endâ€”not comparable to a days walk, & then an evening reading over the fire. Hospital trains go by. A hot day to be wounded. Anyhow, it cant last, this intensityâ€”so we thinkâ€”more than 10 days. A fateful book this. Still some blank pagesâ€”& what shall I write on the next 10?

This idea struck me: the army is the body: I am the brain. Thinking is my fighting.
