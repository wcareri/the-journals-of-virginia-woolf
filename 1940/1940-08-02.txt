### Friday 2 August

Complete silence surrounds that book. It might have sailed into the blue & been lost. â€œOne of our books did not returnâ€ as the BBC puts it. No review by Morgan, no review at all. No letter. And thoâ€™ I suspect Morgan has refused, finding it unpalatable, still I remainâ€”yes honestly, quiet minded, & prepared to face a complete, a lasting silence. And fullâ€”no not of ideasâ€”Iâ€™m so jaded after Philip Morell, Pippa, & the London uproarâ€”but with a sense of things forming, & freedom. So thats satisfactory.

About Philipâ€”laid in a lemon coloured jersey in bed. Ottâ€™s drawing room cut in half. P. rather shaky, rather patched in complexion, & plausible, fluent & undistinguished. Reminisced: about Roger: a most ineffective man; a most unhappy man; his life so sordid. â€œNo, Iâ€™ve not had a happy life. I wasted my time in politics. No we were very unhappy Ottoline & I at Garsington. Quarrelled often. Thought of separating. We were so unhappy we came here. Our last years were very happy.â€ This said with his old rams watery smile. Cheerful enough, but only with Bridge & old memories. I think disillusioned about Ott. Tepid about her diaries. Thinks heâ€™s getting weaker & wont live through the winter. Things suddenly go black. Surrounded by polished furniture: too much furniture. Very flabby yet mildly affectionate. Showed me photographs: if Iâ€™ve the energy Iâ€™ll get one copied for you. Then summoned Milly had out shawls pressed oneâ€”a coloured one I choseâ€”on me. Outside Milly asked me to look at his bathroom, said â€œHeâ€™s very lonely very lonely. Heâ€™s too proud to ask people to come. None of the old friends come; only the family. Miss Julian does her best. But sheâ€™s always been hardâ€”she doesnt care for any of her ladyships things. Sheâ€™s no comfort. The Dr says dont be shocked if you go in & find him dead. Iâ€™m glad you encouraged him to play Bridge. I say after all whats the use of living without â€¦â€¦ but heâ€™s better now. I put him straight to bed when he comes back. There is his placeâ€”in the dining room with a book rest in front of his plate.â€

I shook hands & walked off with my shawl.
