How odd that I should have had 3 letters in praise of Trimmerâ€”Lady Oxford, Pipsey & a Helen Browneâ€”when I was going to tear the proof up! How silly I was to be enraged yesterday (1) by Miss Gardner (2) by being beaten at bowls. Yet how the grass shone pale emerald green when I walked off my temper on the marsh after dinner. The passages of colour, over Asheham, like the green backgrounds in Vermeer & then the little rusty grey church, & the cows, sun beaded, fringed with sun. We quarrelled about our communal feeling: I said I simper when I cohort with Gardner. L. said â€¦ but we made it up.

We were shown how charcoal absorbs gas in the Hall. And then, after a dull necessary lecture, old Miss Green, shedding her officers cloak, appeared in blue trousers & let herself down from the Rectory window, hanging by her toenails & descending with a jump. Captain Hanna said his bones were like glass. If he jumped, even from a bus, they would break. A red lipped woman asked me if Aga saucepans were made of aluminium; & L. has given all our saucepans to Mrs Ebbs to make aeroplanes with. I dont like any of the feelings war breeds: patriotism; communal &c, all sentimental & emotional parodies of our real feelings. But then, weâ€™re in for it. Every day we have our raids: at night the bloodhounds are out. I open my window when I hear the Germans, & the broad stalks of light rise all over the meadow feeling for themâ€”a strange early morning spectacle. One sees nothing but the feelers of light. Then the drone buzz booms away, rather like a dentists drill. No invasion so far.

I refused Dotty & Hilda, rather tartly; for Hildaâ€™s hand on the reins is a heavy oneâ€”why not write the same article, she suggests, twice in different words? Why not indeed. The idea of their book is one of those meritorious meretricious tidy-minded ideas, that are the most detestable & the least pinned downable. Money patriotism, literature & some organising arranging motive, all embracing & intertwining.
