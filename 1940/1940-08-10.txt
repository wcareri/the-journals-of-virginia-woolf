### Saturday 10 August

And then Morgan slightly damped me: but I was damp already from Leslie hum haw the night before & the day before & again tomorrow. So Morgan & Vita slightly damped: & Bob slightly elated & Ethel, & some old boy in the Spectator, attacking Read. But Gods truth, thats the end of it all. No more reviews, & if I had solitudeâ€”no men driving stakes digging fresh gun emplacements & no neighbours, doubtless I cd. expand & soarâ€”into PH. into Coleridge; but must firstâ€”damn Johnâ€”re-write the LT.

Incessant company is as bad as solitary confinementâ€”Angelica for 2 nights, adorable, oh yes, & intimate & mature, & I see so much more of her side when I talk to herâ€”her so reasonable & lovely sideâ€”if it werent too, a delusion. But is love ever quite a delusion? Well J.â€™s is. I reduce myself to initials for discretion; but cant spin a word to catch a fly after these 10 days of people & people again. Now Mabelâ€™s here wh. adds to comfort but diminishes privacy. So thats my chart at the moment. No invasion. Large air flightsâ€”little white gnats this evening. Sales very goodâ€”2nd edition ordered. But I want sleep & silence.
