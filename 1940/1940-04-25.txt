### Thursday 25 April

My mother, I was thinking had 2 characters.

I was thinking of my memoirs. The platform of time. How I see father from the 2 angles. As a child condemning; as a woman of 58 understandingâ€”I shd say tolerating. Both views true? Herbertâ€™s death recalls him. The groan. That man will kill me! H. going up to talk in the study. Hearing his wheeze of a laugh on the stairs at night. Essence of a prigâ€”a don, I thought. He came into the day nursery. Advised us to read some shilling shocker. Uneasy condescension. A more friendly memory of a walk at Brighton. I had to choose the way. Chose against his wish. His frock coat. The King coming to Oxford. Uncle H. advising. Cd be pressed. H.â€™s shyness. How he told Emmy â€œdont be a fool!â€ crossing the road, when she screamed. At Oxford when a don. Walking to Bores Hill. He asked me about Trevyâ€™s book. I praised it. He demurred. The same question next year. I denigrated it. He defendedâ€”but pleased. His vanity. His advice at the Ilbertsâ€™ house. History required special training. I was left alone to consult him. Did I suggest history? or fiction? a serious depressing interview. â€œH. posts his letters on the school room table.â€ Then the Cabinetâ€”coming to Hogarth House, discussing action v. contemplation. â€œIâ€™m not a great hand at writingâ€¦â€ Some uneasy self-consciousness. The Magnolias at Kew. H. looking. And the lunchâ€”the Dutch sweets. â€œMr F. at a Cabinet meeting.â€ A long talk alone about Armistice day. Olive brought him. He stayed. Told me about Milner. The war won today. So to the last social meeting at New College. The party. His light cats tread. His hollow benevolence. His shell. His affection. His considerateness. His enthusiasm. Father & Fred. His stories. Warmer & mellowerâ€”asking me to come again. Gave me Homer, gave me his books. But the distance too great. & soâ€”I shant give him the pleasureâ€”never went there. And thats over.

Herbert Fisher as a young man was almost ungainly: with his prominent cheekbones & adams apple. He had innocent blue eyes: a wisp of hair. Much improved in dignity & distinction as he aged. Finally the very type of culture & distinctionâ€”light in a pea jacket. Composed, benâ evolent, wary. A crane like man. Much like Adrian.
