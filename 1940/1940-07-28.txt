### Sunday 28 July

Oh yes I see what this book isâ€”its a refuge from Desmond. The mild kind avuncular Desmond. Iâ€™ve been beaten at bowls, & so the half paragraph turns to lead. Now if Morgan had written I shouldnt have turned it to lead. But I feel my irritation at being beaten fasten itself & phrase makeâ€”make the old phrases, for wh. God knows, thereâ€™s no justification whatever today. Why do I mind being beaten at bowls? I think I connect it with Hitler. Yet I played very well. And, in an hours time, shall be repeating the other phrase wh. I made during the first game: a Season of calm weather. Such a curious peace; a satisfactory quiet. I shall see no one in London Yes for a moment I believe that I can compass a season of calm weather. Yet â€˜theyâ€™ say the invasion is fixed for Aug. 16th. A season of calm weather is the crown for which Iâ€™m always pushing & shoving, swimming like the hedgehog who cuts his throat with his paws Nessa said yesterday at Câ harleston, if he swims. Angelica there: I diagnose strain; a little defiance, restlessness. And feel in Q. something heavy, mature, depressed. Almost a year heâ€™s been in the fields: all corn coloured & red poppied with his blue eyes for convolvulus. Judith & L. came on Monday.. Thus our island will be invadedâ€”my season of calm weather. Many ~~an island~~ a green isleâ€”why cant I remember poetry? Clive silly & truculent about Auden & Isherwood. I guess heâ€™d already looked up his own name in Râ oger Said heâ€™d only read Margeryâ â€™s Foreword. And my family will accept this book in complete silence. 2 years hard work. But I shall hear enoâ€™ from â€˜the publicâ€™. Why dont we praise, or blame, each other? Has everything been said? Is it the repletion at the end of a party?

Queer, when its so tame after all, a book coming out, why one writes them? How much part does â€˜coming outâ€™ play in the pleasure of writing then? Each one accumulates a little of the fictitious V.W. whom I carry like a mask about the world.

Waiting for the Sunday papers in which RF. will, or may, be disposed of by Desmond &, perhaps, Basil de Selincourtâ€”looking up over the page to see if L. is coming across the orchardâ€”does not favour the looking up of quotations in Coleridgeâ€™s letters. I know that I shant get any superlatives either way. I know that Desmond (who very likely wonâ€™t do it) will if he does, gently hum & haw something about Mrs Woolfâ€™s charm & sympathy & then proceed to give his own version of R. which will probably be more amusing than mine; & thatâ€™ll fill his short column. Of course I am anxious partly to know how it strikes R.â€™s friends: thats an element not present in a novel review. Anyhow, how much less exacerbating this Sunday morning is than The Years Sunday morning. I remember coming out here in an ecstasy almost a bewilderment of relief when B. de S. for whose opinion I have hardly any respect, praised itâ€”I thought too highly. No, L. does not come.

Its a splendid summer morning, & Janetâ€™s white butterfliesâ€”the white birds she saw when she was dyingâ€”are all about the trees. It is 10.30 & I think I am calm enoâ€™ to return to Coleridge, until 11. when I shall allow myself to go indoors. I forgot, in the above analysis, to include the Frysâ€”their reactions to good or bad reviews. That also tells.

Yes, Desmond is, as always to me, slightly depressing. I divine that is that he feels I havenâ€™t given the familiar, the human, Rogerâ€”â€˜ourâ€™ Roger. That Iâ€™ve made a just & animated biography, stressing the public side, the intellect, the austerity & so on; but not been personal & ungirt enough. I think this is what L. felt. But then Nessa & Margery didnâ€™t. Anyhow there it isâ€”& Desmond is going to write at greater length next week. Nothing in the Observer. So I return, not much depressed, not much exalted, to my Coleridge.
