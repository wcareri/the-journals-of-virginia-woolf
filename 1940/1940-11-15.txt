### Friday 15 November

As I cannot write if anyone is in the room, as L. sits here when we light the fire, this book remains shut. A natural slimming process. A screw over the end of P H. made me rather sink into the disillusions yesterday. We have been a bit pressed. Michael MacCarthy to lunch; L.â€™s lecture; Nessa to lunchâ€”2 hard shopping days, in one of wh. I bought blue serge slacksâ€”all this has rattled my head; so I plunged into the past this morning; wrote about father; & then we walked in top boots & trousers through the flood. Increased again. Lewes this evening with 2 lights showing looks like a harbourâ€”like a French town spreading its skirts round a bay. I had a gaping raw wound too reading my essay in N.W. Why did I? Why come to the top when I suffer so in that light?

Coventry almost destroyed. The usual traffic last night. All the hounds on their road to London. A bad raid there. When I am not writing fiction this fact seeps in. The necessity of living in the upper air. Then I tidied my room & threw masses on to the potato box for Louie. This also revives. I am a mental specialist now. I will enjoy every single day. We took 2 rooms at Bottenâ€™s. I am always behindhand with letters. I am reading Readâ€™s Auty: a tight packed unsympathetic mind, all good cabinet making. And pin my faith still to Trevyâ€™s history. And now return to that. Wind rising. So perhaps the traffic will be interrupted.
