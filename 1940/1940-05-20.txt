### Monday 20 May

This idea was meant to be more impressive. It bobbed up I suppose in one of the sentient moments. The war is like desperate illness. For a day it entirely obsesses; then the feeling faculty gives out; next day one is disembodied, in the air. Then the battery is re-charged, & againâ€”what? Well, the bomb terror. Going to London to be bombed. And the catastropheâ€”if they break through: Channel this morning said to be their objective. Last night Churchill asked us to reflect, when being bombed, that we were at least drawing fire from the soldiers for once.

Desmond & Mooreâ  are at this moment readingâ€”i.e. talking under the apple trees. A fine windy morning. Moorâ e has a thatch of soft unattached hair: red rimmed eyes, very steady; but less force & mass to him than I remembered. Less drive behind his integrity which is unalloyed, but a little weakened in thrust by the sense of age (65) & not quite such a solid philosophic frame as I suppose when we were all young we anticipated. So that our reverenceâ€”how mute I was at the Sangersâ€”how timidly I ventured my little complimentâ€”is now what one might call retrospective. At tea yesterday with Nessa & Quentin we remembered his great influence: his silences. â€œI didnt want to be silent. I couldnt think of anything to sayâ€ he said, rebutting, I think with some feeling that heâ€™d carried this influence too farâ€”our charge that he had silenced his generation. Hence his dependence on Desmond; who started talking, to the towel horse, to the cat, when he was a baby, & was sent to school to silence him. Many old memories. These spin a kind of gauze over the war: wh. is broken by papers: & at listening in time. The war then is waged vigorously till I throw Coleridge into the fire: & it takes another leap. D. & I discussed Irene; & some of the old anecdotes of course appear intact. A good talker makes his toilet of a morning much as a Mary Hutchinson makes up. Word for word we had the definition of age; wh. I think I recorded after our dinner. What is impressive however, are the improvisations. I like hearing Desmond give his first versionâ€”say ofâ€”I forgetâ€”on the spur of the moment. Nessa & I sat & talked here (the Lodge) while they bowld. Politicsâ€”the peace termsâ€”how the young havent had a chanceâ€”Even we. She knitting Q.â€™s grey stockings: will have a show at the Leicester Galleries. Then to London the whole lot of us tomorrow; & on Friday here again. Roger & the proofs have entirely receded; nor can I tackle Walpoleâ€”havent even read the book; & its Â¼ to 12: then lunch: extravagant guinea fowl; Moore munches like a chaff cutter; I guess has not a liberal table at home; takes a logical view of food; eats philosophically to the end: while Desmond sprinkles sugar & cream, also liberally but erratically. So the housekeeper in me rises into being, in this miserable life of detail & bombast.
