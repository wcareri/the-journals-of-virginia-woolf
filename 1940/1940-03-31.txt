### Sunday 31 March

I would like to tell myself a nice little wild improbable story to spread my wings after this cramped ant-like morningâ€”which I will not detailâ€”for details are the death of me. Thank God, this time next week I shall be freeâ€”free of entering Mâ â 's corrections & my own into margins. The story?â€”oh about the life of a bird, its cheep cheepâ€”its brandishing of a twig by my windowâ€”its sensations. Or about Botten becoming one with the mudâ€”the glory fadingâ€”the million tinted flowers sent by the doleful mourners. All black like a moving pillar box the woman wasâ€”& the man in a black cardboard casing. A story dont comeâ€”no but I may unfurl a metaphorâ€”No. The windows very dove grey & dim blue islandsâ€”a rust red on L. & V. & the marsh green & dark like the floor of the sea. At the back of my head the string is still wound tight. I will unwind it playing bowls. Then Bobo. And still waxen legs. To carry the virtues of the sketchâ€”its random reaches its happy findsâ€”into the finished work is probably beyond me. Sydney Smith did in talk. Note. To Read P. Plymley. Yes, bare wood spring painted is very fineâ€”flesh pink & elephant grey. Knitting is also a help. Margery says its useless.

Butter all eaten by guests. Asked to meet Tom & Desmond at Hutchinsons. Excitement. Wine. Good food. Old Desmondâ€”shall we go? I wd like to write short book stories. I would like to recapture my own fling.

Sâ . & Sâ . all scenes, very sharp. Surprises. masterly. Some pedestrian stylised pages, wh. she ends brusquely. The door opened. In cameâ€¦. Willoughby â€¦ or, Edward. Very dramatic. Plot from the 18th Century. Mistressly in her winding up. No flagging. Rather heres an end. And the love so intense, so poignant. And marriage ends all. Sisters love sympathetic. Old Mrs Dashwood the image ofâ€”Mrs Curtis? Mrs Easdale?â€”Elinor I suppose Cassandra: Marianne Jane, edited. Well now for my blue knitting.
