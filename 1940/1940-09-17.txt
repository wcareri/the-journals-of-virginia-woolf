### Tuesday 17 September

No invasion. High wind. Yesterday in the Pub. Library I took down a book of Peter Lucasâ€™s criticism. This turned me against writing my book. London Library atmosphere effused. Turned me against all lit crit; these so clever, so airless, so fleshless ingenuities & attempts to proveâ€”that T.Â S. Eliot, for example is a worse critic than F.L.L. Is all lit. crit. that kind of exhausted air?â€”book dust, London Library, air. Or is it only that F.L.L. is a second hand, frozen fingered, university specialist, don trying to be creative, don all stuffed with books, writer? Would one say the same of the Common Reader? I dipped for 5 minutes & put the book back depressed. The man asked What do you want Mrs Woolf? I said a history of English literature. But was so sickened, I cdnâ€™t look. There were so many. Nor cd I remember the name of Stopford Brooke.

I continue, after winning two games of bowls. Our island is a desert island. No letters from Meck. No coffee. Papers between 3 & 4. Cant get on to Meck, when we ring up. Some letters take 5 days coming. Trains uncertain. One must get out at Croydon. Angelica goes to Hilton via Oxford. So we, L. & I, are almost cut off. John agitated. Talks of L.â€™s â€œbravadoâ€: but L. hasnt spent a night in London. This irritates L. who says he will go up by train tomorrow. Happily he now postpones. I dont want to spend a day bomb dodging; train prisoned. We found a young soldier in the garden last night, coming back. â€œCan I speak to Mr Woolf?â€ I thought it meant billeting for certain. No. Could we lend a typewriter? Officer on hill had gone & taken his. So we produced my portable. Then he said: â€œPardon Sir. Do you play chess?â€ He plays chess with passion. So we asked him to tea on Saturday to play. He is with the anti aircraft searchlight on the hill. Finds it dull. Cant get a bath. A straight good natured young man. Professional soldier? I think the son, say of an estate agent, or small shopkeeper. Not public school. Not lower class. But I shall investigate. â€œSorry to break into your private lifeâ€ he said. Also that on Saturday he went to the pictures in Lewes.
