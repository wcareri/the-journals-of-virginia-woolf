### Thursday 12 September

A gale has risen. Weather broken. Armada weather. No sound of planes today only wind. Terrific air traffic last night. But the raid beaten off by new London barrage. This is cheering. If we can hold out this weekâ€”next weekâ€”week afterâ€”if the weatherâ€™s turnedâ€”if the force of the raids on London is brokenâ€”

We go up tomorrow to see John about moving Press; to patch the windows, rescue valuables, & get lettersâ€”if that is weâ€™re allowed in the square. Oh, blackberrying I conceived, or remoulded, an idea for a Common History bookâ€”to read from one end of lit. including biog; & range at will, consecutively.
