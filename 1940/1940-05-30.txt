### Thursday 30 May

Walking today (Nessaâ€™s birthday) by Kingfisher pool saw my first hospital trainâ€”laden, not funereal, but weighty, as if not to shake bones. Something what is the word I want: grieving & tender & heavy laden & privateâ€”bringing our wounded back carefully through the green fields at which I suppose some looked. Not that I could see them. And the faculty for seeing in imagination always leaves me so suffused with something partly visual partly emotional, I canâ€™t though its very pervasive, catch it when I come homeâ€”the slowness, cadaverousness, grief of the long heavy train, taking its burden through the fields. Very quietly it slid into the cutting at Lewes. Instantly wild duck flights of aeroplanes came over head; manoeuvred; took up positions & passed over Caburn. Percy has seen Westmacotâ tâ€™s man, home on leave, very thin, drawn & aged; says its a hell: was at Arras: all had to fight. And the same stories as the papers about the brutality to refugees. Mrs Dedman is off north. Louie worried & sad. Her mother cant stand the strain now the boys are gone, alone with the chattering idiot. A Mrs Ayres, who loves my books, called, to suggest a mental home. Mrs West has made up her mind to become a nurse & let him go. So whats to become of father, Louie asks, whose nerves are bad? This is a pinch of Hitler in the cottages of Rodmell too. No news today. Holding the lineâ€”heroismâ€”all the usual perorations, in the usual highflown tense voice. Oh for a speaking voice, once in a wayâ€”not Haroldâ€™s though, which disgusted me as well as Mr McLaren. â€œDoes Mr Nicolson speak before or after dinner?â€”â€ Like the imposition of personality in writingâ€”say Meredithâ€™s style, or Carlyleâ€™s, when one wants facts. And being beaten at bowls irritates me; & Iâ€™m strained writing PHâ€”so much more of a strain than Roger. And no meat today. And weeded this morning. And was very happyâ€”the moment can be that: only theres no support in the fabricâ€”if you see what I mean, as Charlie Sanger used to sayâ€”theres no healthy tissue round the moment. Itâ€™s blown out. But for a moment, on the terrace, no one coming, alone with L., ones certainly happy. And I like the windblown state of ones body in the open airâ€”wind, warm wind washing all the crevices, a feeling one doesnt have in London, an air cleanliness, not a soap & water one.
