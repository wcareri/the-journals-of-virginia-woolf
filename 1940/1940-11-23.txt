### Saturday 23 November

Having this moment finished The Pageantâ€”or Poyntz Hall?â€”(begun perhaps April 1938) my thoughts turn, well up, to write the first chapter of the next book (nameless). Anon, it will be called. The exact narrative of this last morning should refer to Louieâ€™s interruption, holding a glass jar, in whose thin milk was a pat of butter. Then I went in with her to skim the milk off: then I took the pat & showed it to Leonard. This was a moment of great household triumph.

I am a little triumphant about the book. I think its an interesting attempt in a new method. I think its more quintessential than the others. More milk skimmed off. A richer pat, certainly a fresher than that misery The Years. Iâ€™ve enjoyed writing almost every page. This book was only (I must note) written at intervals when the pressure was at its highest, during the drudgery of Roger. I think I shall make this then my scheme: if the new book can be made to serve as daily drudgeryâ€”only I hope to lessen thatâ€”anyhow it will be a supported on fact bookâ€”then I shall brew some moments of high pressure. I think of taking my mountain topâ€”that persistent visionâ€”as a starting point. Then see what comes. If nothing, it wont matter.

To lunch with B. & A. at Claverham yesterday. B. was surly from the start. A. a little spotty. Also nervous. I got a little solitary gossip in the chimney corner. But its not the old family ease. B. suspects the family influence. B. dislikes the house. No room to swing a cat in he grumbled. â€œBut I rather like the country.â€ I, of course, at once saw the country as something I envied. We lost our way. Up a lane we went to a tree shadowed house, with a pond; & a swan; & a curious thatched barn, with small Gothic windows. I waited in the car. Such antiquity all gone to pieces. Some old farm waggons, some ploughs; a battered car in the yard. L. was wrongly directed. I knocked again; & an old buck in riding breechesâ€”blue eyed, nair netted, munching her solitary lunch, came out. I noticed the ancient bits, walking sticks; & also the very fine panelled door. Câ . farm house is in the fields. It has a pond. Long tracks of grass. Red plumed woods in the distance. And four hollow trees. Also a barn. I cd have fancied living there; it has a marble bath & W.C.: many rooms; thick walls; tiled passages; central heating. But they said it was betwixt & between: nothing in itself. When I think of Monks House when we took itâ€”when I think of the Eâ arth Closetâ  in the garden; & the cane chair over a bucket, & the dogs barking; & how I hated the villageâ€”which has now become familiar & even friendlyâ€”arent I on the Cttee of the WIâ€”dont I go to a meeting on Monday?â€”then I wd have given my eyes to live in Claverham, with the fields, & the green paths, & the farm horses ploughing. L. however saw none of this. In fact, A.â€™s position, with B. as her mentor, struck us both as almost grotesqueâ€”a distortion: a dream; for how can she endure Bottom. And when will she wake? So we drove back to the civilisation of Lewes, & I bought my cream separator: a sieve with which you skim the milk.

The flood is less todayâ€”as Q. & Elizabeth Watson lunch tomorrow to see it. No word from John. The L.T. article starred in a Lit. Sup. leader. Am I again in favour? Yesterday a raider came popping over the hill: L. saw a smoke rise. In fact it was shot down at Tarring Neville. Louie says the country people â€œstompedâ€ the heads of the 4 dead Germans into the earth.
