### Sunday 8 December

I have only five minutes after a struggle with Ellen Terry to say that the warâ€”yes I have left only 5 minutes to fill in that omissionâ€”the war goes on; In ten years I shall ask, what was happening to the war? It is better. The Greeks are driving the Italians out of Albania. Perhaps this is the turning point in the war. But it dribbles out in such little drops. One cant always catch them. The war slowly enacts itself on a great scene: round our little scene. We spend 59 minutes here; one minute there. Badoglio has resigned. And if we beat Italy we beat Germany. It is a cold windy winter day.
