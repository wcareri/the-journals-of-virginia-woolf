### Sunday 15 September

No invasion yet. Rumours that it was attempted, but barges sunk with great loss. Via Maynard, via Major Gardner & Percy. Raids over Brighton this afternoon. Hornets (our own) swarmed over my head on the marsh. Sheep frightened. Its difficult to see the English white circle. Mabel goes tomorrow; so pray God the Church bells dont ring tonight. Domestically, a great relief & peace, & expansion, itâ€™ll be tomorrow, into merry kitchen harum scarum ways. Now we go to our last Cook cooked dinner for I dont know how long. Could it be the end of resident servants for ever? This I pray this lovely fitful evening, as well as the usual Damn Hitler prayer. Carried wood; bowls; asked for Sara Coleridge, as tho the New Statesman were immortal.
