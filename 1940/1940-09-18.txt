### Wednesday 18 September

â€œWe have need of all our courageâ€ are the words that come to the surface this morning; on hearing that all our windows are broken, ceilings down, & most of our china smashed at Meck. Sq. The bomb exploded. Why did we ever leave Tavistock?â€”whats the good of thinking that? We were about to start for London, when we got on to Miss Perkins who told us. The Pressâ€”what remainsâ€”is to be moved to Letchworth. A grim morning. How can one settle into Michelet & Coleridge? As I say, we have need of courage. A very bad raid last night on London. Waiting for the wireless. But I did forge ahead with PH all the same.
