### Friday 7 June

Just back this roasting hot evening. The great battle which decides our life or death goes on. Last night an air raid here. Today brittle hard sparks. Up till 1.30 this morning, Kingsley, diffusing his soft charcoal gloom. Question of suicide seriously debated among the 4 of usâ€”R. Macaulay the otherâ€”in the gradually darkening room. At last no light at all. This was symbolic. French are to be beaten; invasion here; 5th Coin active; a German pro-Consul; Engsh Govt in Canada; we in concentration camps, or taking sleeping draughts. The menace now is Ireland. K.M. gives us about 5 weeks before the great attack on Engld begins. I will continue tomorrow when less sleepy. Saw Stephen, Sybil, John, Morgan, Judith, Raymond, K.M. Rose Macaulay, finally W. Robsonâ€”but cant discriminate
