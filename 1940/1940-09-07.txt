### Saturday 7 September

An air raid in progress. Planes zooming. No, that oneâ€™s gone over, very quick & loud. Cdnt see if it were English.

Ben Nicolson for the night. A very tall red faced obstinate tongue tied apprehensive gentle but obdurate not very clever, slow indeed, serious however; reminding us of Vita (to look at) then Harold, then a touch queerly incongruously of Eddy. Very well mannered wh. perhaps increases difficulty. Very diffident. Coming from a large world. But speechless: till after dinner: when he developed his charge against Roger: that he didnâ€™t personify artists, & by omitting biography, intellectualised: so didnt reach the masses, â€œdidnt show that Leonardo was thinking of a tree.â€ I guess B.â€™s got hold of a crooked stick; & will produce (come peace) rather formless, many worded, literary books. Dressed as a private in big boots this morning.

More planes over the house, going I suppose to London, which is raided every night. A fight no doubt in Kent.
