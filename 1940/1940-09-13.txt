### Friday 13 September

A strong feeling of invasion in the air. Roads crowded with army wagons: soldiers. Just back from half day in London. Raid, unheard by us, started outside Wimbledon. A sudden stagnation. People vanished. Yet some cars went on. We decided to visit lavatory on the hill; shut. So L. made use of tree. Pouring. Guns in the distance. Saw a pink brick shelter. That was the only interest of our journeyâ€”our talk with the man woman & child who were living there. They had been bombed at Clapham. Their house unsafe. So they hiked to Wimbledon. Preferred this unfinished gun emplacement to a refugee over crowded house. They had a roadmans lamp; a saucepan & cd boil tea. The nightwatchman wdnâ€™t accept their tea; had his own. Someone gave them a bath. In one of the Wimbledon houses there was only a caretaker. Of course they cdnâ€™t house us. But she was very niceâ€”gave them a sit down. We all talked. Middle class smartish lady on her way to Epsom regretted she cdnt house the child. But we wdnâ€™t part with her, they saidâ€”the man a voluble emotional Kelt, the woman placid Saxon. As long as sheâ€™s all right we dont mind. They sleep on some shavings. Bombs had dropped on the Common. He a house painter. Very friendly & hospitable. They liked having people in to talk. What will they do? The man thought Hitler wd soon be over. The lady in the cocks hat said Never. Twice we left. More guns. Came back. At last started, keeping an eye on shelters & peoples behaviour. Reached Russell Hotel. No John. Loud gunfire. We sheltered. Started for Meck. Sqre: met John, who said the Sqre still closed; so lunched in the hotel. Decided the Press emergencyâ€”to employ Garden City Pressâ€”in 20 minutes. Raid still on. Walked to Meck. Sqre. Refused admittance. John told us the story of Monday night. Bombs whistle, if they fall near. He heard two whistles. Looked out. A great blaze in Guilford St. Gas main struck & the Foundling shelter opposite Stephen hit. He decided heâ€™d take shelter. Then an explosion. He went into Square & saw a tree where Byron Court had been. Also a great cloud of thick grey dust. Also a man walking slowly in his pyjamas. Then they were told to leave the Square. Later he met several young women at some Bar with hair, he thought, powderedâ€”really the dust of the house. Some saved by an iron bar in the basement. Some its thought killed. They became merry. He rather white & shaky. Left him with distant guns firingâ€”Started back. All clear in Marylebâ one High St.
