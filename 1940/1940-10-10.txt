Rather flush of ideas, because I have had an idle day, a non-writing dayâ€”what a relief once in a wayâ€”a Vita talking day. About what? Oh the war; bombs; which house hit, which not; then Benâ€™s attack; then our booksâ€”all very ample easy & satisfying. She has a hold on life, knows plants & their minds & bodies, lunches with Prince Bernhart, makes a curtsey to the wrong man â€œI am Robert of Austriaâ€â€”washes up with R. of A. & is generally slack & abundant & wholly without the little artists back kitchen smell, so perceptible in Helen, large & tolerant & modest, with her hands loosely upon so many reins: sons; Harold; garden; farm. Humorous too, & deeply, I mean awkwardly, dumbly affectionate. Iâ€™m glad that our love has weathered so well. She drove us to Lewes; a great storm; car incommoded; siren sounded as we left her at the crossroads. A wave of her hand; she drives off in her leggings brown velvet coat & yellow shirt grown, I suppose people wd. say, rather heavy & blowsy; her eyes less lustrous; her cheeks spreadâ€”but so careless of it all, it dont matter. So we walked home across the marsh. How free, how peaceful we are. No one coming. No servant. Dine when we like. Living near to the bone. I think weâ€™ve mastered life rather competently.

I was thinking of Mabelâ€™s history. Her friend has died. Could I write it, how profoundly succulent it wd be. The cold pear shaped woman: her suppressed country childhood: no its her life with Charles that interests me. He was â€˜on his own.â€™ Did a good deal of shady dealing I imagine. Lived in lodgings kept by an old lady near Elephant & Castle. Used to eat raw tripeâ€”being from Yorkshire. A typical underworld card. He made a good deal at dog races. He wd take Mabel to race after race. How did they meet? He was life & romance to her. Why didnt they marry? Had he a wife? Every spare day I wd find him a solid red face grizzled man in his shirtsleevesâ€”perhaps helping to wash up. His other passion was the Opera. He knew them all by heart. For hours they wd stand in a queue, at the Old Vic &c. She knew all the tunes. What a queer relationshipâ€”she so dumb & passive yet following him; maternally proud of him, to races, to plays: following the form of horses; always with something on. I gave him 3 lemons; but I also made her come down here, when he was illâ€”Lord, the bloodless servitude of the domestic poor! Now sheâ€™s been â€œas near death as can beâ€â€”the flats toppling on to their shelter. It is something like an Arnold Bennett novel the life of the bastard woman; her subterranean London life, with this â€˜friendâ€™ as she called him. Charles Stanford I think his name wasâ€”Charles will doâ€”or wont doâ€”She thought of him as of a small impetuous boy. Now his life is over; & no one will know more than I do about Charles & Mabel.
