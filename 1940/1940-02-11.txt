### Sunday 11 February

By way of postponing the writing of chequesâ€”the war, by the way, has tied up my purse strings again, as in the old days of 11/- a week pocket moneyâ€”I write here: & note that the authentic glow of finishing a book is on me. Does this mean its good; or only that I have delivered my mind successfully? Anyhow, after shivering yesterday, today I made a stride, & shall I think finish this week at 37. Its tight & conscientious anyhow. So, walking this mildish day, up to Telscombe I invented pages & pages of my lecture: which is to be full & fertile. The idea struck me that the Leaning Tower school is the school of auto-analysis after the suppression of the 19th Century. Quote Stevenson. This explains Stephenâ€™s autobiography; Louis MacNeice &c. Also I get the idea of cerebration: poetry that is not unconscious, but stirred by surface irritation, to which the alien matter of politics, that cant be fused, contributes. Hence the lack of suggestive power. Is the best poetry that which is most suggestiveâ€”is it made of the fusion of many different ideas, so that it says more than is explicable? Well thats the line; & it leads to Public Libraries: & the supersession of aristocratic culture by common readers. Also to the end of class literature: the beginning of character literature; new words from new blood; & the comparison with the Elizabethans. I think thereâ€™s something in the psycho-analyâ sâ is idea: that the L.Tower writer couldnâ€™t describe society; had therefore to describe himself, as the product, or victim: a necessary step towards freeing the next generation of repressions. A new conception of the writer needed: & they have demolished the romance of â€˜geniusâ€™ of the great man, by diminishing themselves. They havenâ€™t explored, like H. James, the individual: they havent deepened; theyve cut the outline sharper. And so on.

L. saw a grey heraldic bird: I only saw my thoughts. No news from Charleston, but so absorbed in all this, Iâ€™m indifferent.
