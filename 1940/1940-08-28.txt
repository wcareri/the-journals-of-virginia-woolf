How I should like to write poetry all day longâ€”thats the gift to me of poor Ann, who never reads poetry because she hated it at school. She stayed from Tuesday to Sunday night, to be exact; & almost had me down. Why? Because (partly) she has the artists temperament without being an artist. Sheâ€™s temperamental, but has no outlet. I find her charming; individual; honest, & somehow pathetic. Her curious obtusity, her slatiness of mind, is perceptible to her. And she hesitates. Ought one to make up? Richard says yesâ€”I say no. The truth is she has no instinct for colour; no more than for music or pictures. A great deal of force & spirit & yet always at the leap something balks her. I can imagine her crying herself to sleep. So, having brought no rations, or book, she floundered on here. I called her, to mitigate her burden, My good dog, my Afghan houndâ€”with her long too thick legs, & her long body; & the shock of wild unbrushed hair on top. Iâ€™m glad Iâ€™m so nice looking she said. And she is. But well it taught me, that week of unintermittent interruptions, bowls, tea parties & droppings in, what public school is likeâ€”no privacy. A good rub with a coarse towel for my old mind no doubt. And Judith & Leslie are about to play bowls. This is why, my first solitary morning, after London, & the protracted air raidâ€”from 9.30 to 4amâ€”I was so light so free so happy I wrote what I call PH poetry. Is it good? I suppose not, very. I should say, to placate V.W. when she wishes to know what was happening in Aug. 1940â€”that the air raids are now at their prelude. Invasion, if it comes, must come within 3 weeks. The harrying of the public is now in full swing. The air saws; the wasps drone; the sirenâ€”its now Weeping Willie in the papersâ€”is as punctual as the vespers. Weâ€™ve not had our raid yet, we say. Two in London. One caught me in the L. Library. There I sat reading in Scrutiny that Mrs W. after all was better than the young. At this I was pleased. John Buchanâ€”â€œV.W is our best critic since M. Arnold & wiser & justerâ€”â€ also pleased me. I must write to Pamela. Sales a little better.

28th Aug. P.S. to the last page. We went out on to the terrace, began playing. A large two decker plane came heavily & slowlyâ€”L. said a Wellesley something. A training plane said Leslie. Suddenly there was pop pop from behind the Church. Practising we said. The plane circled slowly out over the marsh & back, very close to the ground & to us. Then a whole volley of pops (like bags burst) came together. The plane swung off, slow & heavy & circling towards Lewes. We looked. Leslie saw the German black cross. All the workmen were looking. Its a German; that dawned. It was the enemy. It dipped among the fir trees over Lewes & did not rise. Then we heard the drone. Looked up & saw 2 planes very high. They made for us. We started to shelter in the Lodge. But they wheeled & Leslie saw the English sign. So we watchedâ€”they side slipped glided swooped & roared for about 5 minutes round the fallen plane as if identifying & making sureâ€”then made off towards London. Our version is that it was a wounded plane, looking for a landing. â€œIt was a Jerry sure enoâ€™â€ the men said: the men who are making a gun hiding by the gate. It wd have been a peaceful matter of fact death to be popped off on the terrace playing bowls this very fine cool sunny August evening.
