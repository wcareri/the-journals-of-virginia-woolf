Now we are in the war. England is being attacked. I got this feeling for the first time completely yesterday. The feeling of pressure, danger horror. Vita rang up at 6 to say she cdnâ€™t come. She was sitting at Sâ issinghurst. the bombs were falling round the house. Theyd been fighting all day. Iâ€™m too jaded to give the feelingâ€”of talking to someone who might be killed any moment. Can you hear that? she said. No, I cdnt. Thats another. Thatâ€™s another. She repeated the same thingâ€”about staying in order to drive the ambulanceâ€”time after time, like a person who cant think. Sheâ€™d heard that Christopher Hobhouse was killed by a bomb: that Cynthia Northâ€”so lovely like a young colt she was killed by a bomb she trod on. It was very difficult talking. She said it was a comfort to talk. She broke offâ€”Oh how I do mind this, & put the telephone down. I went & played bowls. A perfect quiet hot evening. Later the planes began zooming. Explosions. We were talking to Leslie & Judith & Pat Trench. To bed. Planes very close: explosions. Nessa says today there was a great blaze at Ripe. A tinkling sound in the field. Bomb cases found today. A great raid on London last night. Today quiet here. When I rang up St. after dinner, someone cut in with a call to Maldon. â€œRestricted service. Things very bad there just now.â€ The feeling is that a battle is going onâ€”a fierce battle. May last 4 weeks. Am I afraid? Intermittently. The worst of it ones mind wont work with a spring next morning. Of course this may be the beginning of invasion. A sense of pressure. Endless local stories. Noâ€”its no good trying to capture the feeling of England being in a battle. L. has just driven Judith & Leslie to the station. At last we shall be alone. Molly wont come. I daresay if I write fiction & Colâ eridge & not that infernal bomb article for USA, I shall swim into quiet water. L. sleeps sound all through it every night.
