### Friday 29 November

Many many deep thoughts have visited me. And fled. The pen puts salt on their tails; they see the shadow & fly. I was thinking about vampires. Leeches. Anyone with 500 a year & education, is at once sucked by the leeches. Put L. & me into Rodmell pool & we are sucked suckedâ€”sucked. I see the reason for those who suck guineas. But lifeâ€”ideasâ€”thats a bit thick. Weâ€™ve exchanged the clever for the simple. The simple envy us our life. Last night L.â€™s lecture attracted Suckers. Gwen Thompsett is a sucker. (L. is getting logs so I cant write). From this to manners:â€”a thought to keep for my book.

John has writtenâ€”wobbly: wants lime light & bouquets. 3rd imp. of Roger: & I not told.

Very busy this last week. To London: Bella & Tom. The last of 37 as a residence: furniture arrives on Monday. Leech Octavia asks to come. B. & A. tomorrow. Now I must read Ellen Terry.
