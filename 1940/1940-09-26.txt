### Thursday 26 September

A rather strained talk on the phone with Nessa. She hasnâ€™t forgiven the Anrep conversation;â€”damn Helen for once more moving herself into an impregnable position. However, Nessa held the Trump card. â€œBoth our studios have been destroyed. The roofs fallen in. Still burning. Pictures burnt.â€ So I had to pipe low. My fallen ceilings a trifle. Helen a mares nest. Our strategy was to invite the A.s & the B.s to the same tea. The A.s accept rapturously. So therell be 3 very unpleasant hours on Saturday. I must prepare my behaviour. Think of things to say. Gathering apples all the afternoon. German raider comes over. Shots fired at Asheham. Bombs towards Seaford. Writing to Ld Ponsonby I remain unmoved. Only a German bomber? Oh thats allâ€”No I didnâ€™t look outâ€”Consider this remark last yearâ€”still more, 10 years, still more 50 years ago. In flush with PH. thank God: & The Listener suggests a review. So Iâ€™m nose to the grindstone; the perfect antidote to Anreps.

I never mentioned Ken Sheppard, the unknown soldier. But must return to Michelet.
