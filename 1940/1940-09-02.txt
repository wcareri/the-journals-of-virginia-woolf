### Monday 2 September

There might be no war, the past 2 days. Only one raid warning. Perfectly quiet nights. A lull after the attacks on London. At Charleston yesterday a skeleton Memoir Club. We sat in the sun. It was hot. The apples hung red. Not a sound. Angelica & B. produced a sense of strain. Maynard what I call unredeemed Maynard, rather severe, snubbing, truculent. Talk about lives. Mine of Roger I gather is called by Maynard â€œThe official lifeâ€. â€˜Why not write the real life for the Memoir Club?â€™ (thats why I thought him morose & savage.) Bunny said Biographies will always interest. Morgan said not to the next generation. The sensitive like ourselves wont interest them. I said autobiographies are their line. M. interested came over to me. We discussed Hugh. I said he was a prostitute. Q. said Derain was a prostitute. I read my Dreadnought notes, not very well. Lydia wdnâ€™t come. â€œShe feels this is not the time for brainsâ€ said Maynard. Tired after bowls & writing my USA War article my mind jibs at recording. Yet talk is interesting. Nessa said artists always did what they could. Maynard said thereâ€™d be no change after the war. We shd. go back to where we were. Morgan lost his spectaclesâ€”found them in a book. Clive had been on Firle Tower & saw the flash at sea when the explosion came. Said it was a German big gun firing across Channel. Q. denied this. Bunny A. & Maynard walked off. I told Morgan how Iâ€™d tried being honest with Hugh. Hugh had snubbed Morgan. Talk about Penguins. Argument as to whether theyâ€™re read.

So lovely an evening that the flat & the downs looked as if seen for the last time. No raid. Slept over Sara Coleridge. Letters from Ben (R. absorbing) from Bessie T. (a great biography). Letters I shd be answering instead of scribbling here. It is perfect summer weather. A man stopped on the bank with all its battlements to say so. Mr Freeth showed me the fire engine: danger of incendiary bombs. Will Jansen paint the iron shed? Heâ€™s a matter of fact chap. I urged camouflage if only on artistic grounds. And so this page is perhaps unnecessarily filled
