### Wednesday 7 February

(Motherâ€™s birthday: Nessaâ€™s wedding day.) Oh I had such a profound reflection on the tip of my tongue, L. being downstairs, chiming in with Bradfieldâ€™s lecture. It was to the effect that now, no longer in the movement, & remote in this water sogged country, nowâ€™s the time to see if the art, or life, creed, the belief in something existing independently of myself, will ~~weather the/stand the~~ hold good. These hesitations signify that Iâ€™ve been titivating R.: how spell Fr Bartolomeo?

Well, if it dont stand like a flagstaff, then its been a washout, (word chosen in deference to the new movement.) John for the night; & he plunges us in new this & that. Very niceâ€”so eager & â€˜boyishâ€™ as the old women say: pulling up his shirt to show his rash. We had the Gardners to tea. The old wispy red veined blue eyed pussy purring Major. Very courteous, rather rambling, & inclined to dodder off into moralities about the Crab. That is why the crab is so small, & walks sidewaysâ€”an old Indian story. The children bolt eyed & transfixed, partly in fear of what Papa might say. And John rather Prince Consort. So a fair beat up talk about poetry, about communism. John obviously bored, but chivalrous. And then out with his documents, & his plans. Radiant hope for the New Writing; for the young. Clearly his metier to go ringing his cowbell in advance. Inclined to write about Wm Morris. Oh & all the doings of the boys. Peter Watson sponged upon by Connolly, Guardsmen & Hamilton. The sink of buggery. Berkeley Square houses the whole hive. Stephen fallen into vice again; sentimentalising with Freud & another; Bleeding his heart all over the place; & J. half hurt, half scornful. Its a queer little eddy, just below the surface;â€”& familiar of old, thoâ€™ not so highly organised. So I drivel longing for the meeting to be over. I will copy the days headlinesâ€”Towards a Settlement with Japan. The next phase in India; Red rout in Finland. 5,000 killed & no room for the rest.
