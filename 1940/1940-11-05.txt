### Tuesday 5 November

The haystack in the floods is of such incredible beauty â€¦ When I look up I see all the marsh water. In the sun deep blue, gulls caraway seeds: snowberriesâ : atlantic flier: yellow islands: leafless trees: red cottage roofs. Oh may the flood last for everâ€”a virgin lip; no bungalows; as it was in the beginning. So we showed it to Mary & Mrs Hamilton (an Italian; formerly married to Franchetti). Now its lead grey with the red leaves in front, our island sea. Caburn is become a cliff.

I was thinking: the University fills shells like H.A.L.F. & Trevelyan. They are their product. Also: never have I been so fertile. Also: the old hunger for books is on me: the childish passion So that I am very â€˜happyâ€™ as the saying is: & excited by PH. This diary shorthand comes in useful. A new styleâ€”to mix.

Yvonne knew Rezia. She now dreads germs. Covers her hands to shake hands. A very dull life in the Palazzo Corsini. Nerino a doctor. Was with the Huxleys & Sullivan when Ott & Pip came. Ott bathing in pink tights with a great hat. I liked her when I found she was Italian. Mary like a jennetâ€”a mare with ears laid back. I liked her. Jimmy Sheehan drinks. All the young English drink spirits. I like wine. Air raids much less. Greeks holding out. Prospect more hopeful. A crybaby letter from John. Doing the work of 3 men for 2$â€”all our fault. This his reaction to his own folly in poaching Auden. Auden has cried offâ€”taking Johnâ€™s Â£100. Hamish Hamilton a publisher. Publishes Mrs Thirkell. Mr Hanna arrives with L.â€™s armlet: violet silk with gold letters. Oh the black out wh. nips me in the bud. Miss Pound out with the Canadian. The Canadian playing a game in the road as I ordered dinner. Estimate from Carvills for bringing furniture Â£25. No lettersâ€”only Denny. And so to read George Trevelyan the perfect product of the Universities.
