### Friday 19 January

I cant say that this after tea system has been good for this large page. But Sussex has been sociable. Aâ ngelicaâ€™s 21st birthday party, & its legacy of Lewises; then Flora; then Morgan; then London, from which we came back this after noon to frozen pipes. Dean is flaring away at the spare room at this instant, & this gives me an excuse for not nailing my brain to some solid bookâ€”an essay of Bertieâ€™s say. My London technique is improving. A concert at Nat Gal; Hugh & Wm Plomer to dinner, Sybil to teaâ€”all accomplished. And last night The Importance of Being Earnest, a thinnish play, but a work of art; I mean, its bubble dont break. And I took about 60 pages to be typed.

By way of a brain graph, I record that for 5 days I could do nothing but improvise my WEA lectureâ€”syllabled it in the bath, on walks; wrote a sketch nefariously. Now its spent, that fever, & I shall attack the Omega with appetite tomorrow. Why this sudden pressure on the brain? Its uncontrollable.

Hugh is rather like the winter sunâ€”his ruddy edges slightly blurred. He wore a red flower. Wm. in a buff waistcoat, but sharpened, disappointed,â€”life unsatisfactory; embitteredâ€”no blur, rather a chopping block. I diagnose some sense of defeat & strain, part private, part war. A man in painâ€”on the stretch; so that some string gives a discord. No, thats not quite it. Looks dissipated, with work, with dull & dreary work; & no creativeness; but a standard, which dear old Hugh (he wrote to thank â€œDearest Virginiaâ€ this morning) has forced down. I suppose a little second rate. At dinner when I told him that Maynard had read Sea Tower, he looked like a small boy tippedâ€”an endearing bashfulness. We talkedâ€”if I could face the labour of inverted commasâ€”about Horizon: Stephen condemned; & about Humbert Wolfe; dead of overwork; about Frankau (his memoirs as chirpy as a robinâ€”honest, edited of course, rasping, & with the real life profusion which only the shelly & tough skinned can stand) & then Hugh told us the story of the Conrads, told it very well: about C. sizing up the sod. masseur at tea; withdrawing, shrieking; & Miss Hallows & Jessie, who wouldnt ask Miss Hallows for the salt; & C. shut up alone with her; & Jessie growing fat on the sofa with her bad leg; about Boris & his forgery; so to diaries, his own left to Rupert Hart Davis; & so to Dickens; & the Vn hypocrisy, Thackeray haling a prostitute in the street opposite the Garrick; Dickens & his mistress; (all spoken as if they were old friendsâ€”so they areâ€”if youre in the Hugh tradition, but Wm. & I arent)â€”so to Trollope; & defamation of Wells; a mere scribbler; compare him with Conrad. What then is an artist? A question Iâ€™d like to solve. A bitter cold night & they stayed till 12.30: then went into the moonlight, & left the door open.

Here I change pens: my hands are so cold; & my brains cold, yes, very like Janiceâ€™s cheap car, which wont start. One should have a piece of porous paper to press on the brain when its hot, instead of chafing it to work, as I do now, from idleness, from distraction. Oh I made up a little of P.H. at 37, & think Iâ€™ve tapped something perhapsâ€”a new combination of the raw & the lyrical; how to slide over. I think 2 years at Roger may have filled the cistern.

Then Sybil. I was touched. Her cheeks were so cold when she came in. Why did she think it worth coming? Vanity was flattered. After working off all our graces & pacesâ€”Hugh to dineâ€”oh Hugh wrote to me this morningâ€”we got warmer about the past. She never liked George. Used to meet him at the Wards. He patronised her. He broke hearts. Dorothy Ward was in loveâ€”passionately. G. didnâ€™t care. An arch snob. Old Gerald, the greedy, the vulgar, far more to him. The young intellectuals at the Savile liked him; disliked George. So I sketched our family life. She was more humanâ€”asked me to dine at the Ordinary. & went out into the bitter black & white square.
