### Thursday 17 October

Our private luck has turned. John says Tavistock Sqre is no more. If thats so, I need no longer wake in the night thinking the Wolves luck has taken a downward turn. For the first time they were rash & foolish. Second, an urgent request from Harpers Bazaar for an article or story. So that tree, far from being barren, as I thought, is fruit bearing. And Iâ€™ve spent I dont know how much brain nerve earning Â£30 gs. with 3 little articles. But I say, the effort has its reward; for Iâ€™m worth, owing to that insect like conscience & diligence, Â£120 to the USA.

A perfect dayâ€”a red admiral feasting on an apple day. A red rotten apple lying in the grass; butterfly on it, beyond a soft blue warm coloured down & field. Everything dropping through soft air to rest on the earth. The light is now fading. Soon the Siren; then the twang of plucked strings â€¦ But its almost forgettable still; the nightly operation on the tortured London; Mabel wants to leave it. L. sawing wood. The funny little cross on the Church shows against the downs. We go up tomorrow. A mist is rising; a long fleece of white on the marshes. I must black out. I had so much to say. I am filling my mind slowly with Eâ lizabeâ thans, that is to say letting my mind feed like the Red Admiralâ€”the Siren, just as I had drawn the curtains. Now the unpleasant part begins. Whoâ€™ll be killed tonight? Not us, I suppose. One doesnâ€™t think of thatâ€”save as a quickener. Indeed I often think our Indian summer was deserved: after all those London years. I mean, this quickens it. Every day seen against a very faint shade of bodily risk.

But to continueâ€”Ly Oxford writes a crude grasping letter. Ethel, having done her usual trickâ€”sympathy, I must have sympathyâ€”forgets & owns sheâ€™s alive, in fact, bustling; so why be taken in by the extroverts ever again? They scream to rouse an echoâ€”like Hugh, Ethel must must be heard. Vita sent a broken po, & Jacobs sheep wool. Not an extrovert. And I returned to PH today; & am to transfer my habitual note taking I thinkâ€”what I do on odd daysâ€”to Random reading. The idea is, accumulate notes. Oh & Iâ€™ve mastered the iron curtain for my brain. Down I shut when Iâ€™m tied tight. No reading no writing. No claims, no â€˜mustâ€™. I walkâ€”yesterday in the rain over, the Piddinghoe downâ€”a new line.
