### Wednesday 2 October

Ought I not to look at the sunset rather than write this? A flush of red in the blue; the haystack in the marsh catches the glow; behind me, the apples are red in the trees. L. is gathering them. Now a plume of smoke goes from the train under Cabum. And all the air a solemn stillness holds. till 8.30 when the cadaverous twanging in the sky begins; the planes going to London. Well its an hour still to that. Cows feeding. The elm tree sprinkling its little leaves against the sky. Our pear tree swagged with pears; & the weathercock above the triangular church tower above it. Why try again to make the familiar catalogue, from which something escapes. Should I think of death? Last night a great heavy plunge of bomb under the window. So near we both started. A plane had passed dropping this fruit. We went onto the terrace. Trinkets of stars sprinkled & glittering. All quiet. The bombs dropped on Itford Hill. There are two by the river, marked with white wooden crosses, still unburst. I said to L.: I dont want to die yet. The chances are against it. But theyre aiming at the railway & the power works. They get closer every time. Caburn was crowned with what looked a settled moth, wings extendedâ€”a Messerschmitt it was, shot down on Sunday.

I had a nice gallop this morning with Coleridgeâ€”Sara. Iâ€™m to make Â£20 with 2 articles. Books still held up. And Spiras free, & Margot writes to say â€˜I did itâ€™ & adds, â€œa long letter all about yourself & what you believe.â€ What do I? Cant at the moment remember. Oh I try to imagine how oneâ€™s killed by a bomb. Iâ€™ve got it fairly vividâ€”the sensation: but cant see anything but suffocating nonentity following after. I shall thinkâ€”oh I wanted another 10 yearsâ€”not thisâ€”& shant, for once, be able to describe it. Itâ€”I mean death; no, the scrunching & scrambling, the crushing of my bone shade in on my very active eye & brain: the process of putting out the light,â€”painful? Yes. Terrifying. I suppose soâ€”Then a swoon; a drum; two or three gulps attempting consciousnessâ€”& then, dot dot dot
