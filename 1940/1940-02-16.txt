This diary might be divided into London diary & Country. I think there is a division. Just back from the London chapter. Bitter cold. This shortened my walk, which I meant to be through crowded streets. Then the darkâ€”no lighted windows, depressed me. Standing in Whitehall, I said to my horses â€œHome Johnâ€, & drove back in the grey dawn light, the cheerless spectral light of fading evening on housesâ€”so much more cheerless than the country eveningâ€”to Holborn, & so to the bright cave, wh. I liked better, having shifted the chairs. How silent it is thereâ€”& London silent; a great dumb ox lying couchant. The people I saw were, Margery Fry: 2 or 3 hours: a touching soft furred bundle; red nosed, or cheeked, with so many thorns in her softness. I remember: â€œPeople are divided into lovers & friendsâ€â€”to justify her lack of love. So we rummaged in old memories, & revived whats been said so often about Rogerâ€™s loves & character. She is off to France, & pricked my apathy by suggesting that I should comeâ€”& made me deplore my spineless acquiescence; she so mobile.

Dinner party: Tom & Saxon: Clive in afterwards. Saxon a pink plump hoarse oldish man: in his raucous sudden mood: complete silence; then raps out some statement, as hard as a walnutâ€”no sequence, no suggestiveness. Tomâ€™s great yellow bronze mask all draped upon an iron framework. An inhibited, nerve drawn; dropped faceâ€”as if hung on a scaffold of heavy private brooding; & thought. A very serious face. & broken by the flicker of relief, when other people interrupt. But our talk?â€”it was about Civilization. All the gents, against me. Said very likely, more likely than not, this war means that the barbarian will gradually freeze out culture. Nor have we improved. Tom & Saxon said the Greeks were more thoroughly civilised. The slave was not so much a slave as ours are. Clive also pessimisedâ€”saw the light going out gradually. So I flung some rather crazy theories into the air. Then to Humbert Wolfe, striking odd little sparks from Tomâ€™s â€˜geniusâ€™ vanity. Thats refreshing, his innocent seriousness about himself as a writer. About H.W. Clive told a storyâ€”how at the Ivy he received his death blow from E. Bibesco, who read him 30 pages: so he went home & died. That led to Tomâ€™s saying he used commas at the beginning of a line; so I added, & no capitals. Then we searched for an old book to trace capital letters. Saxon emitted some scholars facts. What else? It lasted till 12, so there must have been other sayings: John Buchan, I suppose. Yes, he died, & I havenâ€™t yet written to poor black Susie, whoâ€™s unhappy I suspect, clinging to her John as lightning conductor. Tom talked about Stephenâ€™s diary. Pages of S.â€™s conversation â€œfor I cant remember what T.S.E. saidâ€â€”were sent to T.S.E. Heâ€™s benevolent & tolerant of the young. Oh & Yeats. Tom said Turner had made up to Yeats; who was an ill read man; & Dotty successfully imitated himâ€”hence her trumpeting. A good deal of cold weather talkâ€”Tomâ€™s landlady providing one jug of water, & Tom bathing at Fabers. Oh & Sydney Waterlow. â€œI never knew them (S. & Dawks) in the moment of eâ cstasyâ€â€”Tom said with his sly smile. & I thought the same of Tom & Vivienne. S. says Saxon feels himself on the shelf, & so digs hard. This is more or less an accurate specimen of talk in the winter preceding the Spring of 1940.

I had Ciliaâ€™s Finnish letter. People suddenly become grave: forget gossip; remember what at least they ought to be feeling. She wrote to me, out of the blue, about the death, or immortality of Finland. How little that means, at 37 â€¦ no: it means something, but what?â€”Then I suffered from my clothes complex acutely buying 2 new sets of clothes, & being persuaded into a blue striped coat by an astute & human woman at Lewises. â€œBut I want you to have thisâ€”I dont want you just because youâ€™re in the country, to fling on anything. Youâ€™ve got to think of othersâ€ .. as if she guessed all my private lifeâ€”queer: she seemed genuine. Of course I looked a shaggy dowdy old woman. Then to Desire under the Elms: disappointing; flat; elemental situation bare of words; like a scaffold. And B.L. not exciting: & the streets tunnels of gloom.
