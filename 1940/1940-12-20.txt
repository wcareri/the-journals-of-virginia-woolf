### Friday 20 December

Is there a difference of temperature between the morning mind & the evening? If so, it will be detected in the pages that come before this, the morning pages. We have been shopping in Brighton. It is a raw cold day, with the wind rising now. And I am mooning over my Shre. chapter in Râ eading at Râ andom trying to find some clue: some transition from the home to the host and hostess. Biblical prose I am thinking is not colloquial. But I wont work it out: rather give it an hour or so of dumb blind life & trust it will come to the top tomorrow. We bought a duck for our Xmas luncheon. We bought some buns & a wedge of cheese. I bought Eileen Power for 6d & regret not buying a new cigarette holderâ€”mine being foul. Yesterday we went to the village school. They make things. If Raymond had been shown the spindly striped animals he wd have said they were prehistoricâ€”invaluable Mycenean toys. I sat beside the flushed & cushioned Mrs Jansen; also beside Mrs Hanna, & invited Mrs Ebbs to tea, for she has a picture of the Dreadnought.
