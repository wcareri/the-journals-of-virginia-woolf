### Tuesday 12 November

Chamberlain is dead: & if we hold on till March we have broken the back (or whatever the phrase is). These two facts sum up the papers. I could add about Greece â€¦ Hitlerâ€™s speech â€¦ no: time goes so heavy & slow, that nothing marks the days. A bomb fell at lunch yesterday. There is nothing new. Eastbourne bombed. London. I am shirking, in these semi public utterances, the Talbot character. I had it on the tip of my tongue.
