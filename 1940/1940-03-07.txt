### Thursday 7 March

A fortnightâ€”well on Saturday it will be a fortnightâ€”with influenza. Up today for the first time. So it shows my inveterateâ€”whats the word for love of writing?â€”that I open this. Head a white vapour: legs bent candles. All hope abandoned. I think that was the main current, lying in bed. Too feverish in London to abandon hope. Had to scribble down my Lecture, until that was abandoned; & correct the last script of R. Then back on Saturday to bed: with a throat like plates of rough iron, which cracked when I swallowed. Oh & before getting into bed that bitter afternoon I read my epitaphâ€”Mrs W. died so soon, in the N.S. & was pleased to support that dismissal very tolerably. A firm conviction somewhere in my survival power. Yet there I lay abandoned. And read all Havelock Ellis, a cautious cumulative, teased & tired book; too pressed down with that very common woman, Edith: so I judged her; but she was life to him: he lacked life; lacked all quick response: & she was stirring; farmed; preached; at last leapt out of a window. And loved women. Heâ€™s honest & clear but thick & too like the slow graceful Kangaroo with its cautious soft leaps. But thats much due to influenza. Nessa yesterday. Out on terrace today. Spring smellsâ€”clean, sharp, varied. Crocuses out & snowdrops. L. making rock garden. All sounds of human life stilled. Robins & Smyth bag unattended. Some nice person, wanting to hear me lecture, sent me violets. A calm convalesence. But how now can we bring out R.? And does it matter? Anyhow finished. And my brain neednt run on. The lecture can run itself. And â€¦ & â€¦ I forget. Oh its the spring thats come while I was illâ€”birds chirping. Pâ . spraying apple trees; blue crocuses with snowdrops. Yes: enoâ€™ to try my hand on is done.
