### Friday 9 February

For some reason hope has revived. Now what served as bait? A letter from Joe Ackerley approving my Corelli? Not much. Tom dining with us? No. I think it was largely reading Stephenâ€™s autobiography: thoâ€™ it gave me a pang of envy, by its youth & its vigour, & some good novelists touchesâ€”I cd. pick holes though. But its oddâ€”reading that & South Riding both mint new, give me a fillip after all the evenings I grind at Burke & Mill. A good thing to read oneâ€™s contemporaries, even rapid twinkling slice of life novels like poor W.Â H.â€™s. And then, Iâ€™ve polished off, to the last gaiter button, the 3 dâ€”d chapters for London on Monday; & got my teeth I think firm into the last Transformations; & though of course I shall get the black shivers when I reread let alone submit to Nessa & Margery, I cant help thinking Iâ€™ve caught a good deal of that iridescent man in my oh so laborious butterfly net. I daresay Iâ€™ve written every pageâ€”certainly the lastâ€”10 or 15 times over. And I dont think Iâ€™ve killed: I think Iâ€™ve brisked. Hence an evening glow Yet the wind cuts like a scythe: the dining room carpet is turning to mould; & John Buchan has fallen on his head & is, apparently, dying. I have already composed a letter to Susie, who, poor goose, will be crying her eyes out, over there in the great carpeted Palace that she hated so. I think she â€œadoredâ€ him: that is being a goose, believed poor prolific John to be a kind of Providence. I remember all the MSS bound in blue moroccoâ€”scarcely correctedâ€”a kind of genius, she saidâ€”wistfully looking for some corroboration. Indeed, she flattened me out with Johnâ€™s biographies, inscribed by John. Monty Shearman is also dead; & Campbell, L.â€™s absurd nice old Parson friendâ€”his bachelor Buffy friend.

Now the wind rises; something rattles, & thank God Iâ€™m not on the North Sea, nor taking off to raid Heligoland. Now Iâ€™m going to read Freud. Yes, Stephen gave me 3 hours of continuous illusionâ€”& if one can get that still, thereâ€™s a worldâ€”whats the quotationâ€”Thereâ€™s a world outside? No. From Coriolanus?
