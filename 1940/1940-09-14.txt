### Saturday 14 September

A sense of invasionâ€”that is lorries of soldiers & machinesâ€”like cranesâ€”walloping along to Newhaven. An air raid is on. A little pop rattle wh. I take to be machine guns, just gone off. Planes soaring & roaring. Percy & L. say some are English. Mabel comes out & looks. Asks if we want fish fried or boiled. As the result of a friendly cool talk, sheâ€™s going to ask Flossie about plans. They may set up outside the raid area. Anyhow, its settled, I think that she leaves here. A great relief. I like being alone in our little boat. I like provisioning & seeing alls shipshape & not having dependants. And must now write to Harry Stephen before bowlsâ€”a warm letter, couched in Stephenese, about Roger. Distant popsâ€”a rapid little patter of sound over Newhaven way. Workmen on the hanger haystackâ€”disguising a gunâ€”said â€œWish I were as sure of a thousand pounds as of winning the war.â€ Complete confidence. Buck Palace bombed. Altar exposed; & in Eastbourne yesterday a church ruined & organ thrown on road. The BBC become rather sanctimonious over this.

The great advantage of this page is that it gives me a fidget ground. Fidgets: caused by losing at bowls & invasion; caused by another howling banshee, by having no book I must read; & so on. I am reading SevignÃ©: how recuperative last week; gone stale a little with that mannered & sterile Bussy now. Even through the centuries his acid dandified somehow supercilious well what?â€”cant find the wordâ€”this manner of his, this character penetrates; & moreover reminds me of someone I dislike. Is it Logan? Theres a ceremony in him that reminds me of Tom. Theres a parched artificial cruelty &â€”oh the word! the word!â€” Am I oversensitive to character, in writing? I think we moderns lack love. Our torture makes us writhe. But I cant go into thatâ€”a phrase that brings in old Rose, to whom I mean to write. One always thinks theres a landing place coming. But there aint. A stage, a branch, an end. I dislike writing letters of thanks about Roger. Iâ€™ve said it so many times. I think I will begin my new book by reading Ifor Evans, 6d Penguin. And whatever happens I will settle & sun on the moment. 58â€”not so many more. This is quite possible, in any condition. I sometimes think about violent death. Whoâ€™s whistling in the churchyard? The Major says there was a landing, repulsed, at Bournemouthâ . Keep out the war from this page, now & then. Iâ€™m reading Henry Williamson. Again I dislike him.
