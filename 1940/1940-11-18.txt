These queer little sand castles, I was thinking; I was finishing Herbert Readâ€™s autobiography this morning at breakfast. Little boys making sand castles. This refers to H. Read; Tom Eliot; Santayana; Wells. Each is weathertight, & gives shelter to the occupant. I think I can follow Readâ€™s building; so far as one can follow what one cannot build. But I am the sea which demolishes these castles. I use this image; meaning that owing to Readâ€™s article on Roger, his self that built the castle is to me destructive of its architecture. A mean, spiteful Read dwells outside. What is the value of a philosophy which has no power over life? I have the double vision. I mean, as I am not engrossed in the labour of making this intricate word structure I also see the man who makes it. I should say it is only word proof not weather proof. We have to discover the natural law & live by it. We are anarchists: We take the leap (glory that is) from what we know to the instinctive. This is his defence of romanticism, of sur-realism. His selection from literature is: Flaubert, Henry James, Blake, Wordsworth. All we at the moment can do is to make these selections: like dogs seeking the grass that cures us. But of course, being a tower dweller, Read then walls them in, others out. Plato of course did not write reviews for The Spectator. I can thus endow him with a purity that is impossible when I know that little Read attacks Roger. Little Read is the image in the face of a pasty boardschool boy. Is this word â€œlittleâ€ inevitable of the living? I am carrying on, while I read, the idea of women discovering, like the 19th century rationalists, agnostics, that man is no longer God. My position, ceasing to accept the religion, is quite unlike Readâ€™s, Wellsâ€™, Tomâ€™s, or Santayanaâ€™s. It is essential to remain outside; & realise my own beliefs: or rather not to accept theirs. A line to think out.
