### Tuesday 24 December

I note with some dismay that my hand is becoming palsied. Why I cant say. Can I make clear straight lines any more? It seems not. I write this by way of an experiment, indeed its less palsied this morning, but then Iâ€™ve been copying my Ms. of P.H., & am word druggedâ€”but wont go into that. And must go in & wash & dress for the Anreps & our rather forced lunch party.

24th Dec. Christmas Eve, & I didnt like to pull the curtains so black were Leonard & Virginia against the sky. We lunched with Helen; & again â€œI could have fancied living thereâ€. An incredible loveliness. The downs breaking their wave, yet one pale quarry; & all the barns & stacks either a broken pink, or a verdurous green; & then the walk by the wall; & the church; & the great tithe barn. How England consoles & warms one, in these deep hollows, where the past stands almost stagnant. And the little spire across the fields â€¦ We sat in a ground floor garden room, untidy, littered, with the 2 oaves; & they had a spread for us. So back through Lewes. And I worshipped the beauty of the country, now scraped, but with old colours showing.

L. is now cutting logs, & after my rush of love & envy for Alciston farm house, we concluded this is the perfect place. L. says it is exactly right, for we neednâ€™t be cumbered with possessions here. Which reminds me. We are very poor; & my hoard is 450: but must not be tapped again. So I must write. Yes, our old age is not going to be sunny orchard drowse. By shutting down the fire curtain, though, I find I can live in the moment; which is good; why yield a moment to regret or envy or worry? Why indeed?

Yesterday Octavia came with milk & cream; & Lady Oxford sent her car down with the bust of Voltaire on a book. Very heavy. An extravagant gesture on her part. And we saw the Keynes; & I cowered beneath his pugnacious positive puritan waysâ€”A blank wall of disapproval; till I kissed him, on wh. he talked of Lydia, having a book about the ballet, in his eager, stammering way. Questions of peace remains only, he says: our victory certain. Churchill addressed the Italians.
