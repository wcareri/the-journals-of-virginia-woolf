### Thursday 19 December

1940 is undoubtedly coming to an end. The shortest day comes this week: then the days draw out. It wd be interesting if I could take today, Thursday, & say exactly how the war changes it. It changes it when I order dinner. Our ration of margarine is so small that I cant think of any pudding save milk pudding. We have no sugar to make sugar puddings: no pastry, unless I buy it ready made. The shops donâ€™t fill till midday. Things are bought fast. In the afternoon they are often gone. Meat ration diminishes this week. Milk is so cut that we have to consider even the cats saucer. I spent an hour making butter from our skim of creamâ€”a weekâ€™s takings provides about Â½lb. Petrol changes the day too. Nessa can only come here when she goes to Lewes shopping. All prices rise steadily. The screw is much increased since the summer. We buy no clothes but make do with the old. These are inconveniences rather than hardships. We dont go hungry or cold. But luxury is nipped off, & hospitality. It takes thought & trouble to feed one extra. The post is the most obvious inconvenience perhaps. It takes 2 days to get a London letter: 4 to get a parcel. Turkeys impossible. The pinch is said to be worse than last war. If it increases much we shall be hungry, I suppose. Economy on Mabel means less variety in food, more dusting & L. tidying. I bicycle to Lewes instead of driving. Then the black outâ€”thats half an hour daily drudgery. We cant use the dining room after dark. These mornings L. breakfasts in the parlour by electric light. We dip into our great jars for pickled eggs & pretend they dont taste differently. We are of course marooned here by the bombs in London. This last week the raids are so few that we forget to listen for a siren. That used to come at 6.30 punctually. No bombs fall most nights. Beaverbrook warns us that early in Feb. not only raids but invasion will come. The Germans are said to be sending troops to occupy the recumbent Italy. Whats Hitler got up his sleeve next?â€”we ask. A certain old age feeling sometimes makes me think I cant spend force as I used. And my hand shakes. Otherwise we draw breath as usual. And its a day when every bough is bright green & the sun dazzles me.
