Which of our friends will interest posterity most? Maynard? So that if I had any regard for the future I would use this hour to record what he said. About his parents. Lying extended on the sofa the other night with the two fog lamps burning, & Lydia a sort of fairy tale elf in her fur cap. We were talking of my legacy; of Leonardâ€™s mother. And L. said how she had lived in a dream world. So that he made her cry. Upon which M. said his parents had always let him alone: now they reaped the benefit. The old Dr plays Bridge; Mrs, his mother has M.â€™s temperament. â€œBut not ruthless as you can beâ€ said Lydia. M. hesitates, gulps & all his words come out in a rush. He is now supreme, mounted on his sick throne, a successful manâ€”farmer, bursar, a man of business, he called himself, applying for petrol. A heavy man with a thick moustache. A moralist. As interested in Patsy the black dog with the bald patch as in Europe. He was sayingâ€”odd how hard it is to rememberâ€”he was telling us about salt; water; heat & cold & their effect on the urine. About Roger. â€œCan I mention erection?â€ I asked. Lydia â€œWhat?â€ M. â€œStiffâ€ (their private word). No you cant. I should mind your saying it. Such revelations have to be in key with their time. The time not come yet. Sodomy & the WC disinfected. Is he right, or only public school? All is now so ordered, so royally arrayed, that we had to go that Wednesday, because otherwiseâ€”â€œNo Maynard says it is not convenientâ€ Lâ . on the telephone. But words are soon lost. I am writing this, the dâ€”d party, the dark drive in prospect & L. glooming, in order to have a free fling.

So tight & tortured of a morning, but enough of that. Can I descend to the spontaneous populous strata â€¦ after living so long above ground? An obituary: Humbert Wolfe. Once I shared a packet of choc, creams with him, at Eileen Powerâ€™s. An admirer sent them. This was a fitting tribute. A theatrical looking glib man. Told me he was often asked if I were his wife. Volunteered that he was happily married, though his wife livedâ€”Geneva? I forget; remember thinking, why protest? whats worrying you? Oh it was the night Arnold Bennett attacked me in the En Standard. Orlando? I was going to meet him at Sybilâ€™s next day. There was a queer histrionic look in him, perhaps strain in him. Very self assured, outwardly. Inwardly lacerated by the taunt that he wrote too easily; & deified satire; thats my salvage from an autobiography of himâ€”one of many, as if he were dissatisfied & must always draw & redraw his own picture. I suppose the origin of many of the new middle-aged autos. A kind of self psychoanalysis; oh & Viola Garvinâ€”a fume rises from the old cabbage pail of literary gossipâ€”was in love with him; a fact she expressed in a review of Requiem that positively split its sides, ripped open like a balloonâ€”the pressure of praise in it was so terrific. Requiem Vita had with her at Oxford when I lectured once. How rotten, I said, looking at it, as it lay on the dressing table in the Inn. And she was glad she said, owning with her usual simplicity what I, should I?â€”have hidden. So the inspirer of these vague winter night memoriesâ€”he who sends for the last time a faint film across my tired headâ€”lies with those blackberry eyes shut in that sulphurous cavernous face. (If I were writing I should have to remove either lies or eyes. Is this right? Yes, I think for me; nor need it spoil the run. Only one must always practise every style: its the only way to keep on the boil: I mean the only way to avoid crust is to set a faggot of words in a blaze. That phrase flags. Well, let it. These pages only cost a fraction of a farthing, so that my exchequer isnt imperilled.)

Mill I should be reading. Or Little Dorrit, but both are gone stale, like a cheese thats been cut in & left. The first slice is always the best. Mr Gwynnâ e caught me at Piddinghoe on the down yesterdayâ€”a nobleman: lean, sporting, dried, with little wet pebble eyes; a severe man. I smiled. He I think apprehended some incongruity: I was scrambling under the barbed wire in my wool helmet. â€œWhere dâ€™you come from?â€ â€œOnly taking a walkâ€. â€œThis is private.â€ â€œHope Iâ€™m not spoiling your sport?â€ â€œNot at all. You can go onâ€¦â€ Heâ€™ll ask his wife, what odd looking woman lives at Rodmell. Sheâ€™ll guess, Mrs Woolf. Heâ€™ll say â€¦ Louie says heâ€™ll say he dont hold with the Labour Party. He had a row with Paul about the wood on his down. The villagers mustnâ€™t steal it. Paul said they had a right. Story dwindles off. The idiot boy has pneumonia, should die but of course, wont.
