### Friday 26 July

I think I have taken, say a good second, judging from the Lit Sup review. No Morgan. Times say it takes a very high place indeed among biogs: Times say I have a genius for the relevant: Times (art critic I gather) goes on to analyse R.â€™s tones &c. Times intelligent, but not room for more.

Its a nice quiet feeling now. With my Coleridge beneath me, & this over, as it really very nearly (how I hate that clash) is, Iâ€™m aware of something permanent & real in my existence. By the way, Iâ€™m rather proud of having done a solid work. I am content, somehow. But when I read my post its like putting my hand in a jar of leeches: Spira asking this; Douie soliciting books; John my Lâ eaning Tâ ower article; & so Iâ€™ve a mint of dull dreary letters to write. But its an incredibly lovelyâ€”yes lovely is the wordâ€”transient, changing, warm, capricious summer evening. Also I won two games.

A large hedgehog was found drowned in the lily pool; L. tried to resuscitate it. An amusing sight. 2/6 is offered by the Govt. for live hedgehogs. Iâ€™m reading Ruth Benedict with pressure of suggestionsâ€”about Culture patternsâ€”which suggests rather too much. Six vols of Aug. Hare also suggestâ€”little articles.

But Iâ€™m very peaceful, momentarily, this evening.

Saturday I suppose a no-review day. Immune is again the right word. No, John hasnâ€™t read it. When the 12 planes went over, out to sea, to fight, last evening, I had I think an individual, not communal BBC dictated feeling. I almost instinctively wished them luck. I should like to be able to take scientific notes of reactions. Invasion may be tonight or not at allâ€”thats Joubertâ€™s summing up. Andâ€”I had something else to say? but what. And dinner to get ready.
