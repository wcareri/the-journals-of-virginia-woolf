### Saturday 21 September

Weâ€™ve just bottled our honey. Iâ€™m in a rage. Nessa has told those dâ€”d Anreps they can come to the cottage for a fortnight. I walked to Piddinghoe & saw a wedding The clergyman in the vestry said: This page was signed in 1542â€”almost 400 years ago. 400 years hadnt chiselled those red shy yokels into a very sharp shape. The girl was townish, in pleated purple. The man red & coltish. He was seized by a friend in the porch who stuffed a whole bag of confetti between skin & shirt. â€œTo make up for Brighton!â€ he said. Then the air raid went. I heard bombs on Brighton.

I have forced myself to overcome my rage at being beaten at Bowls & my fulminations against Nessa by reading Michelet:

As I told Ethel Smyth, one must drop a safety curtain over ones private scene. Michelet is my safety curtain. Posts still held up. No Buszard; no Times book; no answer from N.S. about Coleridge. The train only goes so far as Peckham. (Theres the all clear, I rather think). Mrs Chavasse says someone left London at 6: arrived at 2 am. We go up on Monday to salvage & see John. Mabel is said to have nailed curtains over the windows. A bomb in Gordon Sqre. All windows at 46 broken. L. has written to ask the Bedfords to remit our rent. If refused, we mean to tackle the Duke, & ventilate in the papers. Very still & warm today. So invasion becomes possible. Smoke was going up like a picture on the house over the hill in Piddinghoe. The river high; all softly blue & milky: autumn quietâ€”12 planes in perfect order, back from the fight, pass overhead. Last night I read a potted version of my USA article. Quentin very burly & male. Mrs West prefers not to have money. A woman shd. stay at home. Miss Gardner amiable & silly but handsome. Fears admitted: the wage earner keeps a perk for himself. A scattered discussion. How odd if one cd strip the flesh & see the various motives function.
