### Thursday 27 June

How difficult to make oneself a centre after all the rings a visitor stirs in oneâ€”in this case E. Bowen. How difficult to draw in from all those wide ripples & be at home, central. I tried to center by reading Freud. These rough rapid twinkling ripples spread out & outâ€”for some hours after EB is in the train. It is a disagreeable after-visit feeling. It has its connection too with too many cigarettes, with incessant knitting. A high wind was blowing; Mabel & Louie picking currants & gooseberries. Then a visit to Charleston. Threw another stone into the pond. And at the moment, with PH only to fix upon, Iâ€™m loosely anchored. Further, the warâ€”our waiting while the knives sharpen for the operationâ€”has taken away the outer wall of security. No echo comes back. I have no surroundings. I have so little sense of a public that I forget about Roger coming or not coming out. Those familiar circumvolutionsâ€”those standardsâ€”which have for so many years given back an echo & so thickened my identity are all wide & wild as the desert now. I mean, there is no â€˜autumnâ€™ no winter. We pour to the edge of a precipice â€¦ & then? I cant conceive that there will be a 27th June 1941. This cuts away something even at tea at Charleston. We drop another afternoon into the millrace. Clive sullen, & effort ridden. Duncan patched & peeled like an onion. He fell down stairs. Then Bunny as bluff & burly & beefy as a Farmer lurches in with Angelica. A clock ticks somewhere. Nothing said.

And so, in this high wind, we reach the present moment; & I find it difficult to centre. I think I must force a C.R. essay into being. E.â€™s stammer also had a disintegrating effect: like a moth buzzing round a flowerâ€”her whirr of voice as she cant alight on a wordâ€”a whirr of sound that makes the word quiver & seem blurred. We talked howeverâ€”& very on the whole congenially. But having spent my words on analysing the central, & being apprehensive that Judith will come & smash me again, I do not record what we said. A very honourable horse faced, upper class hard constricted mind.
