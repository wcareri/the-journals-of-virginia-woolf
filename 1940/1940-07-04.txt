### Thursday 4 July

Again, back from London. But its here that the events take place. Louie, toothless, but all agog: yesterday at 5 pm. pop, pop pop out over the marshes. She was picking fruit. Backfiring she thought. Told by someone it was a raid. So she went in. They bombed the train at Newhaven: the driver died this morning. Passengers lay under seats. Rails wrecked. Today a planeâ€”oursâ€”crashed at Southease. So, the Germans are nibbling at my afternoon walks. The French fleet has been seized & sunk. All Lewes listening to the wireless. Mr Uridge, of whom I bought butter, says the PM â€œmade a strong speech. Now weâ€™re getting to businessâ€. Indeed the fleet capture is the first good news sinceâ€”Narvik? In London K.M. decreed that Tuesday, or today, Thursday, was fixed for invasion. London very safe & solid in feeling. Pink brick fortressesâ€”for ammunition?â€”in main streets. Wire mazes in Whitehall &c. We passed strings of ambulances coming down tagged with boughs. Canadians swarmâ€”want to see Buck Palace. Theres dinner: so private life must be postponed.
