### Sunday 20 October

The mostâ€”what?â€”impressive, no, thats not itâ€”sight in London on Friday was the queue, mostly children with suitcases, outside Warren St tube. This was about 11.30. We thought they were evacuees, waiting for a bus. But there they were, in a much longer line, with women, men, more bags & blankets, sitting still at 3. Lining up for the shelter in the nights raidâ€”which came of course. Thus, if they left the tube at 6 (a bad raid on Thursday) they were back again at 11. So to Tavistock Sq. With a sigh of relief saw a heap of ruins. Three houses, I shd. say gone. Basement all rubble. Only relics an old basket chair (bought in Fitzroy Sqre days) & Penmans board To Let. Otherwise bricks & wood splinters. One glass door in the next door house hanging. I cd just see a piece of my studio wall standing: otherwise rubble where I wrote so many books. Open air where we sat so many nights, gave so many parties. The hotel not touched. So to Meck. All again litter, glass, black soft dust, plaster powder. Miss Talbot & Miss Edwards in trousers, overalls, & turbans, sweeping. I noted the flutter of Miss T.â€™s hands: the same as Miss Perkins. Of course friendly & hospitable in the extreme. Jaunty jerky talk. Repetitions. So sorry we hadnt had her card â€¦ to save you the shock. Its awful â€¦ Upstairs she propped a leaning bookcase for us. Books all over dining room floor. In my sitting room glass all over Mrs Hunterâ€™s cabinetâ€”& so on. Only the drawing room with windows almost whole. A wind blowing through. I began to hunt out diaries. What cd we salvage in this little car? Darwin, & the Silver, & some glass & china. Then, I on my chair hunting, Mabel came. As discreet & matronly as ever. Rather finer & sadder. I arranged that she shd. come here for a fortnight. She too almost, in her very trained servant way, overcome. Our house, she said, like a monkeys house. Hadnt had her clothes off since she left. And going to the hospitalâ€”here she paused. â€œYou hear them whistling round you, you wonder is it our turn next?â€ The flats had fallen on top of her shelter. Anxious of course to sweep to recover my fur coat. I worked with her in the kitchen packing Duncanâ€™s glasses, Nessaâ€™s plates. Very friendly, devoted, her training as helper uppermost. Offered her fare. She refused. (And she hasnt come, greatly to our reliefâ€”Oh the pleasure of the empty houseâ€”of the ship in wh. weâ€™re the crew â€¦) Then lunch off tongue, in the drawing room. John came. I forgot the Voyage of the Beagle. No raid the whole day. So about 2.30 drove home. L. says Â£10 wd cover our damage. Cheered on the whole by London. Damage in Bloomsbury considerable. 3 houses out in Caroline Place: but miles & miles of Hyde Park, Oxford & Cambridge Terrace, & Queens Gate untouched. Now we seem quit of London.

Plans for buying a house in Lewes & storing our furniture. Perhaps hiring rooms for our books at the Rectory. Exhilaration at losing possessionsâ€”save at times I want my books & chairs & carpets & bedsâ€”How I worked to buy themâ€”one by oneâ€”And the pictures. But to be free of Meck, wd now be a relief. Almost certainly it will be destroyedâ€”& our queer tenancy of that sunny flat over â€¦ In spite of the move & the expense, no doubt, if we save our things, we shall be cheaply quitâ€”I mean, if weâ€™d stayed at 52 & lost all our possessions. But its oddâ€”the relief at losing possessions. I shd like to start life, in peace, almost bareâ€”free to go anywhere. Can we be rid of Meck thoâ€™?

Nessa to tea yesterday. Talk of a farmhouse at Chalverton?â€”for A. & B. I at once long to buy itâ€”Checked by L. Tomorrow we go to Lewes & house agents.

I must add that today is as hot as August: walked on downs; heard gunfire at Dover?â€”shelling Calais; summer clothes; L. cleaning beds. Too hot for fire. Mist rising, must black out.
