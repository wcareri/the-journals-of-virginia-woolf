### Tuesday 29 October

Rather than wash my head I will here record (it has taken me 10 minutes to fit new sheets into this book) a London day. Up by train. Saying a chill early morning good bye to Mabel, whoâ€™s gone to Isabel Fry. Train luxurious & fast. Bus 18 waiting. Very little new damage. City looked untouched. The flat wind swept. So walkedâ€”all our part pitted & scarred. At 52 we saw the panels still pendantâ€”3 at least. The scavenger talked to us about Sallyâ€”L.â€™s old fine trusty crone. To buy wool. So round the squares home. Cold sausages in the cold room. Salvaged a few books off the floor. Pritchard had his gardener up with a spade. Much lamented our carpet inches deep in plaster & glass. L. to the Fabians. I by some hanky panky on part of my watch so lateâ€”5 to the Â½ hour in Piccadillyâ€”had to jump into a taxi. St James Church a shell; also the shop opposite. Ruins in Leicester Sqre. Crater in front of the Palace. Willie & L. standing outside Fabians, to Victoria. Air raid sounded. Sat there for Â¾ hour. No guns. So home. And how happyâ€”several lettersâ€”one from the woman gardener, who has never read anything so disgusting as p. 34 in R.F.; book (E.F. Benson) from Times: wood fire & thats all. Today I cycled to Newhavenâ€”City of the Dead. Sepulchred shops empty; silent, dour men. Baker boasted of the raidâ€”at 5.30 yesterday 25 Germans descended: dropped 25 bombsâ€”houses ruinedâ€”little girl killed. â€œAnd not a Spitfire any where near ..â€ The gloomy self consequence of the newly bombed. Home by Tarring Neville. The loveliest of low views.
