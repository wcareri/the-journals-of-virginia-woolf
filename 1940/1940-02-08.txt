### Thursday 8 February

~~Frau~~ Drâ€”yes, she wasnâ€™t Frau though she looked itâ€”& her name? Hinder? Hinckel?â€”I never caught it so to speak firmly,â€”has just gone. This murky February day in which is concealed some flower, some little gesture, of springâ€”how does one feel that? how say it. The light that comes in a London streetâ€”more widely here; she has gone, back to London, to her house with its lounge & its modern Swedish furniture, in Hampstead Garden suburb. She saw her two babies off to Liverpool this morning to stay with their grandmother. And her husband is a doctor, & they are about to spend two weeks in Bath,â€”Oh to have a knapsack & go tramping! she said, being a swarthy hooknosed red cheeked racy Jewess. At least that phase lasted out lunchâ€”We discussed races; she was born in South Africa. Natives smell she said. Native servants rooms smell very strong. We discussed how nice ordinary people are. Then why are they so repulsive in the mass? A question hot solved, partly because the landslip at Redhill had made her so late that lunch (roast chicken; apple amber;) lasted till 2.30. After that she & L. retired to the library to discuss a Fabian treatise on South Africa, wh. she is to undertake, & he to supervise; & I in rubbers & great coat plunged into the marsh, which was, as Iâ€™ve said, veiling, oh very effectively, for the wind blew, our unopened Spring. Here I stop to insert a remark often occurring: how weâ€™re being led to the altar this spring: its flowers will I suppose nod & yellow & redden the garden with the bombs fallingâ€”oh, its a queer sense of suspense, being led up to the spring of 1940â€”So I came back, & had to offer tea. Now at tea she shrivelled in a hard high hat into the common, the lemon on steel acid vulgarity of the obvious, the cheap hard Jewess, which at lunch I hadnâ€™t seen. Confronted with Nessaâ€™s carpet Duncanâ€™s table she could only remember her Hampstead lounge; a transition which made me think of the future: & whatâ€™ll it be, ruled & guided by these active & ambitious & after all competent, & I suppose able, Fabiansâ€”oh why dont they any of them embrace somethingâ€”but what? Poetry, I suppose, the sensuous, the musical? Why must they always stress the ugliness of life; & yet be themselves so vital? And feeling chilled & put in my little compartment, I posted my letters & met poor dying Botten, & stopped L. on the high road & so have arrived here.
