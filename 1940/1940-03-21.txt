### Thursday 21 March

Here is the Good Friday festival beginning. How one can sense that in a garden, with flowers & birds only, I cant say. Now for me begins the twilight hour, the emerging hour, of disagreeable compromise. Up to lunch. In the sitting room for tea. You know the dreary, messy, uncomfortable paper strewn, picking at this & that frame of mind. And with R. hanging over me. Walk out as soon as possible, & keep on reading Herveyâ€™s memoirs. And so come to the top slowly. Iâ€™m thinking of some articles. Sidney Smith. Madame de Stael. Virgil. Tolstoy, or perhaps Gogol. Now Iâ€™ll get L. to find a life of Smith in the Lewes Library. A good idea. Poor L.â€”who looks like an Elizabethan, the picture of Charles Lamb, with his green velvet collar standing round his neckâ€”& so bothered with fetching & carrying, & so serious, & with the old roadmenders bucket of red coal smouldering in him. Iâ€™ll ring up Nessa about sending Helen that chapter, & establish an engagement.

I read Tolstoy at Breakfastâ€”Goldenweiser, that I translated with Kot in 1923 & have almost forgotten. Always the same realityâ€”like touching an exposed electric wire. Even so imperfectly conveyedâ€”his rugged short cut mindâ€”to me the most, not sympathetic, but inspiring, rousing; genius in the raw. Thus more disturbing, more â€˜shockingâ€™ more of a thunderclap, even on art, even on lit.re than any other writer. I remember that was my feeling about W. & Peace, read in bed at Twickenham. Old Savage picked it up. â€œSplendid stuff!â€ & Jean tried to admire what was a revelation to me. Its directness, its reality. Yet heâ€™s against photographic realism.

Sally is lame & has to go to the vet. Sun coming out. One bird pierces like a needle. All crocuses & squills out. No leaves, or buds on trees.

Iâ€™m quoted, about Russian, in Lit sup leader oddly enough.
