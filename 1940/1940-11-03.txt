### Sunday 3 November

Yesterday the river burst its banks. The marsh is now a sea with gulls on it. L. (recovered) & I walked down to the hanger. Water broken, white, roaring, pouring down through the gap by the pill box. A bomb had exploded last month; old Thompsett told me it took a month to mend. For some reason (bank weakened Everest says by pill box) it burst again. Today the rain is tremendous. And gale. As if dear old nature were kicking up her heels. Down to the hanger again. Flood deeper & fuller. Bridge cut off. Water made road impassable by the farm. So all my marsh walks are goneâ€”until? Another break in the bank. It comes over in a cascade: the sea is unfathomable. Yes, now it has crept up round Bottenâ€™s haystackâ€”the haystack in the floodsâ€”& is at the bottom of our field. Lovely if the sun were out. Medieval in the mist tonight.

Tâ€™other night cooking alone, Freeth came. Light showing. A plane overhead (It was bright starlight). Later, P.C. Collins. Here I observed the official bully. So â€˜rudeâ€™: so rasping; the working man male dressed up. Gave me a dressing down. Threatened. Scolded. What a chance to give a lady a bit of his mind! When theyre not respectful, theyve no â€œmannersâ€ to fall back on: only originalâ€”well not savagery, nor brutality: bully is the fittest. Every night you show a light. No other house does. Next timeâ€”prison, fine, indicated. I tried my lady battery on him. No good. Mr Woolf in bedâ€”thats why. No good. So I took notes of him too: useful this breach in the bank of class manners. Anyhow we spent 4 hours stitching curtains yesterday. L. still hanging. And Mary H. on the phone, asking to bring Franzetti tomorrow. I am happy, quit of my money making; back at P.H. writing in spurts: covering, Iâ€™m glad to say, a small canvas. Oh the freedomâ€”
