### Saturday 12 October

I would like to pack my day rather fuller: most reading must be munching. If it were not treasonable to say so, a day like this is almost tooâ€”I wont say happy: but amenable. The tune varies, from one nice melody to another. All is played (today) in such a theatre. Hills & fields; I cant stop looking; October blooms; brown plough; & the fading & freshening of the marsh. Now the mist comes up. And one things â€˜pleasantâ€™ after another: breakfast, writing, walking, tea, bowls, reading, sweets, bed. A letter from Rose about her day. I let it almost break mine. Mine recovers. The globe rounds again. Behind itâ€”oh yes. But I was thinking I must intensify. Partly Rose. Partly Iâ€™m terrified of passive acquiescence. I live in intensity. In London, now, or 2 years ago, Iâ€™d be owling through the streets. More pack & thrill than here. So I must supply thatâ€”how? I think book ~~making~~ inventing. And thereâ€™s always the chance of a rough wave: no, I wont once more turn my magnifying glass on that. Scraps of memoirs come so coolingly to my mind. Wound up by those 3 little articles (one sent today) I unwound a page about Thoby.

Fish forgotten, I must invent a dinner. But its all so heavenly free & easyâ€”L. & I alone. We raised Louieâ€™s wages to 15/- from 12/- this week. She is as rosy & round as a small boy tipped. Iâ€™ve my rug on hand too. Another pleasure. And all the clothes drudgery, Sybil drudgery, society drudgery obliterated. But I want to look back on these war years as years of positive something or other. L. gathering apples. Sally barks. I imagine a village invasion. Queer the contraction of life to the village radius. Wood bought enoâ€™ to stock many winters. All our friends are isolated over winter fires. Letters from Angelica & Bunny &. Chance of interruption small now. No cars. No petrol. Trains uncertain. And we on our lovely free autumn island. But I will read Dante, & for my trip throâ€™ English lit book. I was glad to see the C.R. all spotted with readers at the Free Library to wh. I think of belonging.
