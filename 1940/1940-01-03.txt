### Wednesday 3 January

Monks House, Rodmell

This very large sheet which I bought at Baxterâ€™s two days ago begins a new year, on a new system. Evening over the fire writing, instead of end of the morning scrambling. Thus I hope to write a better hand, &, if it werenâ€™t that Iâ€™ve just heated my head over Roger, the PIP (a bad chapter) more solidly. For unless I can put a little weight into this book, itâ€™ll have no interest, even for an old woman, turning the pages. I have just put down Millâ€™s autobiography, after copying certain sentences in the volume I call, deceptively, the Albatross. We have been out in Janiceâ€™s car, looking for skating. Its a long bitter winter frostâ€”I forget how many degrees of a nightâ€”I think 22 below freezing. Figure an Italian sun yesterday; & hard white snow; & the street like glass; the village treat to Brighton; chains round the wheels; the butcher saying heâ€™d had enough of it, which, as he has to be in the shop cutting joints at 6, I can follow.

I am oppressed & distracted with all my ideas. All the little cuckoos shoving the old birdâ€”Rogerâ€”out of the nest. A book on Wâ omen & peaceâ€”& hereâ€™s L. down from his book.
