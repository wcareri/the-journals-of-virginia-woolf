### Saturday 13 April

â€œThe first crunch of the warâ€â€”thats how Winston puts it. The Gs. have invaded Norway. Battles are going on. News leaks out. Some say this is Hitlerâ€™s downfall. I must make this record, for in fact it gives the old odd stretch to the back curtain of the mind. A fine spring day in front; daffodils luminous groups along the terrace. Aeroplanes overhead. Mine fields laid, apparently to let us land our army. I write, because it is a crunch; after the long lapse; also that Iâ€™m maggoty with lecture writing. Must ease my head. These are my motives. And Nessa rings up about the Roger pictures. Herbert Fisher was knocked senseless, had arm & ribs & skull fractured 2 days ago by a lorry. On Tuesday, London: perhaps Sybil Tom & Desmond. No letters. Mrs Chavasse to tea about the play on Monday. Walking up the violet bank this afternoon. Reading Sydney Smith. Damn this running in the head that comes of lecture writingâ€”cant think why I bother: why I let myself run onâ€”is it suppressed jealousy? partly. Also Iâ€™m interested. But surely its excessive to go on making up, when its only 20 old ladies in black bonnets I shall make up for. Dinner in the oven. Meat bad & scarce. Eggs for dinner. Fish for L. maccaroni. And its time
