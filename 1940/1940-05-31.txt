Scraps, orts & fragments, as I said in PH. which is now bubblingâ€”Iâ€™m playing with words; & think I owe some dexterity to finger exercises hereâ€”but the scraps: Louie has seen Mr Westmacotâ€™s man: â€œIts an eyesoreâ€â€”his description of fighting near Boulogne. Percy weeding: â€œI shall conquer â€™em in the end. If I was sure of our winning the other battleâ€¦â€ Raid, said to be warned, last night. All the searchlights in extreme antennal vibration. They have blots of light, like beads of dew on a stalk. Mr Hanna â€˜stood byâ€™ half the night. Rumour, very likely: rumour wh. has transported the English in Belgium who, with their golf sticks ball & some nets in a car coming from Flanders, were taken for parachutists: condemned to death, released; & returned to Seaford. Rumour, via Percy, transplanted them to â€œsomewhere near Eastbourneâ€ & the villagers armed with rifles, pitchforks etc. Shows what a surplus of unused imagination we possess. Weâ€”the educatedâ€”check it: as I checked my cavalry on the down at Telscombe & transformed them into cows drinking. Making up again. So that I couldnt remember, coming home, if Iâ€™d come by the mushroom path or the field. How amazing that I can tap that old river again; & how satisfying. But will it last? I made out the whole of the end; & need only fill in; the faculty, dormant under the weight of Roger, springs up. And to me its the voice on the scent again. â€œAny waste paper?â€ here I was interrupted by the jangling bell. Small boy in white sweater come, I suppose, for Scouts, & Mabel says they pester us daily at 37, & make off with the spoils. Desperate fighting. The same perorations. Coming through Southease I saw Mrs Cockell in old garden hat weeding. Out comes a maid in muslin apron & cap tied with blue ribband. Why? To keep up standards of civilisation? I also heard a pick-pick as I passed Mount Misery, & crouched low under the thick hedge of cow parlsey & saw the scrubâ€”Leeâ€”risked rudeness, & marched on. Land girls weeding in the field by the river. One elegant in blue trousers & green head band; the other a dumpy elderly spinster, with a vast bottom in knickerbockers. Two more, with hairdressed hair, among the Dedman, Wests & Thompsett men. Began Balzac, Vautrin.
