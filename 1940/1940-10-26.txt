â€œThe complete Insiderâ€â€”I have just coined this title to express my feeling towards George Trevelyan; who has been made Master of Trinity: whose history of England I began after tea (throwing aside Michelet vol. 15 with a glorious sense of my own free & easiness in reading now). Herbert Fisher is another. So (with a â€˜perhapsâ€™) is Maynard. They are Romans not Greeks. I like outsiders better. Insiders write a colourless English. They are turned out by the University machine. I respect them. Father was one variety. I dont love them. I dont savour them. Insiders are the glory of the 19th century. They do a great service like Roman roads. But they avoid the forests & the will o the wisps.

Rather a harassed day yesterdayâ€”Leslie Humphreys: carrying the bust of Sir James. He climbs. Heâ€™s agile. Heâ€™s communicative. But a boreâ€”or will beâ€”a garrulous bore. At the same time he part touched, part flattered me by his little private talk about Judith. How she refers â€œthings to you & Leonard. Youâ€™ve got hold of something worth having.â€ He pools his Bank balance with her: is proud, worshipping, of her; says she suffers, from a sense of guilt. Provides her I suppose with confidence & the normal. But he irritated L.: & Mabel has trod on L.â€™s spectacles; & the Frys will have her. Too cold for more.
