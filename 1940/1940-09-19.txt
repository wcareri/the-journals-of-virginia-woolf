### Thursday 19 September

Less need of courage today. I suppose the impression of Miss P.â€™s voice describing the damage wears off. Another loud night Another bad raid. Oxford Street now smashed. John Lewis, Selfridge, Bâ  & Hâ , all my old haunts. Also British Museum forecourt. A gale & rain here. I picked blackberries, & became absorbed in my LP speechâ€”dearâ€”10 minutes talkâ€”but how difficultâ€”for tomorrow. No letters yet from Mâ . Sâ . No parcels. Pippin wont come. Iâ€™m relieved. Percy is up to some swindle about honey. It costs us about 5/- a comb at this rate. He tervisagates in the usual way. Also has stolen wood.
