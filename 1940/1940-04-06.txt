### Saturday 6 April

Whom did we meet in London this week? Bonamy DobrÃ©e the very moment we arrived. Spick & span, clipped, grey, with a rainbow of medal ribbons across his breast. Training cadets at Filey. Keen unconscious young men, very good at their jobs: instinctively patriotic; the rest â€˜Bolshiesâ€™â€”I mean the intellectuals. Asked his professional opinion about the war, B. said it might last years. No one can afford to attack. So, unless driven by some goad, there we shall sit: until perhaps food or other shortage drives Hitler to sting. No sign of it so far. All quiet save for spasmodic raids. So, having little to add, we planed down on to civilisation talk: about books, the young, the growth of classes, the origin of biography; Tomâ€™s last poem â€œdidacticâ€, & he left thanking us for civilisation. Also he mentioned Valentine, & her house keeping; & how her child is in America; & how we all descend the rungs of lady & gentlemanhood. Has inherited from his odd Pawnbroking banking forefathers a great chest of Vâ â n Silver.

Then a day in bed with headache. Then to my task againâ€”Thurs; lunch with John: met Worsley; a round mild spectacled brown young man, rubbed, smoothed. No relation of GTâ€™s: now at the N.S: where he tidies Raymondâ€™s table. As we talked we hacked thick steak; Oh said John my woman has a dodge for getting rations. No wonder. Some Bloomsbury cabhorse; & for the first time in my lunching out, I had to exchange for a steak that I could cutâ€”And that with difficulty. Then L. was riddled & needled by Miss Robins for 2 hours. A French clock left by Sir Hugh Bell went on striking. She uncovered her secret after the man from Frodsham had mended itâ€”to leave us the MS of Raymond in her will. I spent one afternoon at the Lâ ondon Library looking up quotes. Another buying silk for vests. & we did not dine with the Hutchinsons to meet Tom & Desmond, & how glad I was of the drowsy evening. And so, at 12.45 yesterday handed L. the 2 MSS & we drove off as happy as Bank holiday clerksâ€”Thats off my shoulders! Good or badâ€”done. So I felt wings on my shoulders: & brooded quietly, till the tire punctured: we had to jackal in mid road; & I was like a stalk, all crumpled, when we got here. And its a keen spring day; infinitely lit & tinted & cold & soft: all the groups of daffodils yellow along the bank; lost my 3 games, & want nothing but sleep. Still, other ideas prick; & Watkins offers Â£400 (about) for an essay on a character. Brace shies at Roger though â€œno interest in him in the USAâ€.

Two days holiday before I begin my lecture. Knitting ties. Reading Sydney Smith. Odd feeling to have done (temporarily) a book. And is it good or dull? And whatâ€™ll the old friends say? Never mind that for 3 weeks.
