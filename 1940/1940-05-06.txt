### Monday 6 May

Nessa has just been & told us a â€˜very tiresome piece of family newsâ€™â€”A.â€™s affair with B. (I keep to the discretion of initials). A most astonishing piece of news. Today they set off for 2 months alone in Yorkshire. Pray God she may tire of that rusty surly slow old dog with his amorous ways & his primitive mind. It makes one feel oddly old: even to me comes the emptiness that Nessa feels, as I can guess. A. off alone in love, passionately, with someone old enoâ€™ to be her father. How curiously without youth & laughter; Julianâ€™s death renewedâ€”And what can she be feeling, in the train to Yorkshire this sullen May night? All the nightingales singing from that rusty canine jaw? And the future? I prognosticate an excuse to return in 5 weeks from now. A scene with B.: then a happy summer here, half repentant, as when she gave up the stage.

This blocks the way to my crowded London diary, & reduces it to fribble & patter. Cliveâ€™s night: the police; & Maryâ€™s visit; the Duke of Devonshire & his midnight daffodils; Cliveâ€™s unshaven cheeks; Desmond next dayâ€”all this I leave like torn scraps in a wastepaper basket. Item my tea with Hugh; the fall of Fatty Rogersâ€™ picture; Hart Davis fresh from Peter Fleming; the sulphurous vista of the Green Park; the traffic; Hughâ€™s sodomitic confession of affection; our intimacy interrupted; then Raymond; & little soft round Worsleyâ€™s discourse on the youngâ€”which should bring in my lecture; 200 about there; Robinsâ€™ carnations; no fear on my partâ€”& so home, last Friday, jaded & jangled, with my proofsâ€”& this evenings work blown up, by this explosion of love; & the dream of the Yorkshire moors, & those two setting the supper in order, & retiring to the couch. Nothing will induce her to marry. So the land recedes from my ship which draws out into the sea of old age. The land with its children.

And we have withdrawn from Norway. The first defeat of the war. Hawhaw has it all his own way. Nessa advises us to prognosticate about that. Compare Maynardâ€™s optimism 3 weeks ago. War practically over â€¦ Kingsley of course croaks in triumph. Another lull.

In London we had Wogan & Stephen: then Stephen again with his last poems at 12 am. His book sneered at; I praised it. Johnâ€”well, Mrs Lâ . has broken her thigh. The cold is such I shall have my wood fire. Wrote to GBS this evening.

The worst year weâ€™ve ever had in the Press, I gather.

An old tramp comes to grind scissors. I give him 2, & then reflectâ€”should I spend 1/8 on scissors? This money anxiety contracts & loosens. Oh & Iâ€™ve forgotten I think Vitaâ€™s visit, & can only assure whoever may read this page that weâ€™ve seen & talked a great deal, & Iâ€™ve laboured over my wretched book, unable to strangle my conscience or to write one line as I write hereâ€”for the 2 weeks that have passed since I described Herbertâ€™s deathâ€”about which Mary, by the way, was highly philosophic. But thereâ€™s no Angelica to hoard gossip for.

Its odd how much I thought of that lecture, & now its all forgottenâ€”the agony & the sweat & the old man praising me, & the tea at Fullers, & the man in tweed with the whore, so L. called her.
