### Thursday 5 September

Hot, hot, hot. Record heat wave, record summer if we kept records this summer. At 2.30 a plane zooms; 10 minutes later air raid sounds; 20 later, all clear. Hot, I repeat; & doubt if Iâ€™m a poet. HP hard labour. Brain wâ€”no, I cant think of the wordâ€”yes, wilts. An idea. All writers are unhappy. The picture of the worâ ld in books is thus too dark. The wordless are the happy: women in cottage gardens: Mrs Chavasse. Not a true picture of the worâ lâ d; only a writers picture. Are musicians, painters happy? Is their world happier.

Now, in my nightgown, to walk on the marshes.
