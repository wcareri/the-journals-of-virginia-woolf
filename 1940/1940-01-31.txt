### Wednesday 31 January

To that rapid noteâ€”how odd that I still feel I cant leave a new sight undescribedâ€”there is nothing much to add today. It is thawing. Theres a rush, like a mattress falling, as the snow slides off the roof. We walked on the marsh, & saw a half devoured hare. Dabs of blood on the snow, & such a scrape of a wind, & such hobbling & tumbling over frozen tussocks into the snow that I cut the walk, & came home to type out my ten guinea Corelli. Vita is offered Â£1,850 for a 25,000 word story. My righteous backbone stiffens. Then what about my Â£200 dog story? Ah, but I wouldnâ€™t for any money write 25,000 words. I think Iâ€™ve proved that to be true in this way: the humiliation, that is the obstinate refusal of the brain to comply & oneâ€™s drubbings, & re-writings, & general despondency, even for 2,000 words, make it not so much morally, as physically, intellectually a torture. But its interesting to take the moral temperature now & then. A little quick article I enjoy.

Settled in for another 2 weeks, & only village meetings & books; which however are very â€˜realâ€™â€”I like Burke. I think with luck I may concentrate & sweat out R.â€™s last Transformations. True, I should have enjoyed a wander, but old Mabel reports streets all ice & so on. And I cling to my tiny philosophy: to hug the present moment (in which the fire is going out).
