### Monday 16 September

Well, weâ€™re alone in our ship. A very wet stormy day. Mabel stumped off, with her bunions, carrying her bags at 10. Thank you for all your kindness, she said the same to us both. Also wd I give her a reference? â€œI hope we shall meet againâ€ I said. She said Oh no doubtâ€”thinking I referred to death. So that 5 years uneasy mute but very passive & calm relation is over: a heavy unsunned pear dropped from a twig. And weâ€™re freer, alone. No responsibility: for her. The house solution is to have no residents, but Iâ€™m stupid; have been dallying with Mr Williamsonâ€™s Confessions, appalled by his ego centricity. Are all writers as magnified in their own eyes? He cant move an inch from the glare of his own personalityâ€”his fame. And Iâ€™ve never read one of those immortal works.

To Charleston this afternoon, after provisioning for our siege in Lewes. Last night we saw tinsel sparks here & there in the sky over the flat. L. thought they were shells bursting from the London barrage. Great air traffic all nightâ€”some loud explosions. I listened for Church Bells, thinking largely I admit, of finding ourselves prisoned here with Mabel. She thought the same. Said that if one is to be killed one will be killed. Prefers death in a Holloway shelter playing cardsâ€”naturallyâ€”to death here.
