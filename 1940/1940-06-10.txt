### Monday 10 June

A day off. I mean one of those odd lapses of anxiety which may be false. Anyhow they said this morning that the line is unbrokenâ€”save at certain points. And our army has left Norway & is going to their help. Anyhowâ€”its a day offâ€”a coal gritty day. L. breakfasted by electric light. And cool mercifully after the furnace. Today, too, I sent off my page proofs, & thus have read my Roger for the last time. The Index remains. And Iâ€™m in the doldrums; a little sunk, & open to the suggestion, conveyed by the memory of Leonardâ€™s coolness, enforced by Johnâ€™s silence, that its one of my failures. Reading it as closely as I did, I couldnâ€™t generalise the whole. I think it has a certain completeness; but I also think there are patches of anal; too much quotation; sometimes its cramped & poky. Thats about all I can lay hands on at the moment. The after book stage is on me.

Now to record a funny littleâ€”what shall I call it?â€”snag in my Elizabeth Bowen relationship. I decided, as my October letter went unanswered, & as Rose said sheâ€™d seen her, to take that little bull by the horns & telephone; she was out. So I sent a card, asking if we could meet. No answer today. If thereâ€™s no answer at all, then that friendships over. But why? Cant conceive. But as I cant go on writing, over it must be. And indeed, its not so petty a snag; for I was fond of her; & I think she of me. And we could talk seriously. And sheâ€™s the only one of the younger generation of women â€¦ But whats the use of asking what can have happened? Some gossip? Some mischief making? But as I never said a word, or saw any go between,â€”again, whats the use? If sheâ€™s dumb, one of these days Iâ€™ll ask David Cecil. Thats my little snag.

Now I must at once forage, & busy myself. Raymond, who is leaving the NS for the M. of Information, sends me Haryo. Iâ€™m not in the mood for memoirs. What next? Darwin? Mme de Stael? It must be solid, yet short. I must put my head to the gallop, so as to cover these weeks. PH can be finished. And my Sketch of the Past continued. Some experiment I think. The old book of critical excursion, perhaps â€¦ Yes, an experiment not a drudge.
