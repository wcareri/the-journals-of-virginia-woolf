### Sunday 9 June

I will continueâ€”but can I? The pressure of this battle wipes out London pretty quick. A gritting day. As sample of my present mood, I reflect: capitulation will mean all Jews to be given up. Concentration camps. So to our garage. Thats behind correcting Roger, playing bowls. One taps any source of comfortâ€”Leigh Ashton at Châ arlestoâ n yesterday for instance. But today the line is bulging. Last night aeroplanes (G?) over: shafts of light following. I papered my windows.

Another reflection: I dont want to go to bed at midday: this refers to the garage. What we dread (its no exaggeration) is the news that the French Govt. have left Paris. A kind of growl behind the cuckoo & tâ€™other birds: a furnace behind the sky. It struck me that one curious feeling is, that the writing â€˜Iâ€™, has vanished. No audience. No echo. Thats part of oneâ€™s death. Not altogether serious, for I correct Roger: send finally I hope tomorrow: & could finish P.H. But it is a factâ€”this disparition of an echo.
