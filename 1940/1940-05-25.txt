### Saturday 25 May

Then we went up to what has been so far the worst week in the war. And so remains. On Tuesday evening, after my freshener, before Tom & Wm. P. came, the BBC announced the taking of Amiens & Arras. The French PM told the truth & knocked all our â€œholdingâ€ to atoms. On Monday they broke through. Its tedious picking up details. It seems they raid with tanks & parachutists: roads crammed with refugees cant be bombed. They crash on. Now are at Boulogne. But it also seems these occupations arent altogether solid. What are the great armies doing to let this 25 mile hole stay open? The feeling is weâ€™re outwitted. Theyre agile & fearless & up to any new dodge. The French forgot to blow up Bridges. The G.s seem youthful, fresh, inventive. We plod behind. This went on the 3 London days. The party (Tuesday) agreed to ignore. William told a story about Mrs Hyde Colvilleâ€™s camellia hat being burnt as a wreath at a cremation. Tom, I thought, is ossifying (after Desmondâ€™s geniality) into that curious writers egotism. â€œColeridge & I â€¦ people read only our best poems. They ignore all the rest of me. It is difficult, when lecturing, to leave out oneself. Yet poor man if this complacency gives him a shell, no doubt it protects him from suffering. A very self centred, self torturing & self examining man, seen against Desmondâ€™s broad beam, & Mooreâ€™s candid childs eyes.

Then I had Sybil: & noted herâ€”what in another would be heroism: her son at Arras: she working all day: yet has so much fluid worldliness, & something hard at bottom that one doesnt credit her with enough of her courage. â€œWeâ€™re all in itâ€ she said; simply; yet then curled & shrivelled, because we had had D. & M. & she had been talking to the respectable Cynthia Asquith. Envy writhes at once. Then there was the mad Kot: all his hair brushed up; heavy, yellow, bloodshot. To begin with he told us the story of a Tolstoy. It struck me he lives in what he reads: makes it do instead of living. Then fabricates what he calls a theology. From that he turned to Gertler: his suicide. Has become opinionated & violent. But his madness was about the war. He seemed raving. He seemed almost drunk. All the old rage with Murry is now with Fascists. All Germans are devils. We must kill every one. Then some hare brained scheme. Smoking his expensive cigarettes. And his handshake as crushing as everâ€”as positive. But something gone queerâ€”a screw loose. He gets up at 6 to listen to the BBC at 7. is obsessedâ€”brooding alone at Acacia Road. Does his own housework, & denounces, lays down the law. Had lectured Gertler about his son.

Rodmell burns with rumours. Are we to be bombed, evacuated? Guns that shake the windows. Hospital ships sunk. So it comes our way.

Todays rumour is the Nun in the bus who pays her fare with a mans hand.
