### Friday 29 March

What shall I think of thatâ s liberating & freshening? Iâ€™m in the mood when I open my window at night & look at the stars. Unfortunately its 12.15 on a grey dull day, the aeroplanes are active, Botten is to be buried at 3: & Iâ€™m brain creased after Margery, after John & his John after Q.. But its the little antlike nibblings of M. that infest meâ€”ants run in my brainâ€”emendations, tributes, feelings, datesâ€”& all the detail that seems to the non-writer so easy (â€œjust to add this about Joan &câ€) & to me is torture. Thumbing those old pagesâ€”& copying onto the carbon. Lord lord! And influenza damped. Well I recur what shall I think of? The river. Say the Thames at London bridge; & buying a notebook; & then walking along the Strand & letting each face give me a buffet; & each shop; & perhaps a Penguin. For weâ€™re up in London on Monday. Then I think Iâ€™ll read an Elizabethanâ€”like swinging from bough to bough. Then back here Iâ€™ll saunter â€¦ oh yes & weâ€™ll travel our books round the Coastâ€”& have tea in a shopâ€”& look at antiques, & thereâ€™ll be a lovely farmhouseâ€”or a new laneâ€”& flowersâ€”& bowls with L. & reading very calmly for C.Rs. but no pressure. & May coming & asparagus, & butterflies. Perhaps Iâ€™ll garden a little oh & print, & change my bedroom furniture. Is it age, or what that makes life here alone, no London no visitors seem a long trance of pleasureâ€”or might be, could I be quit of Helen A. & R.

Iâ€™m inducing a state of peace & sensation feelingâ€”not idea feeling. The truth is weâ€™ve not seen spring in the country since I was ill at Ashehamâ€”1914â€”& that had its holiness in spite of the depression. I think Iâ€™ll also dream a poet-prose book, perhaps make a cake now & then. Now, nowâ€”never any more future skirmishing or past regrettingâ€”relish the Monday & the Tuesday & dont take on the guilt of selfishness feeling: for in Gods name Iâ€™ve done my share, with pen & talk, for the human race. I mean young writers can stand on their own feet. Yes, I deserve a springâ€”I owe nobody nothing. Not a letter need I write (there are the poems in MS all waiting) nor need I have week-endersâ€”For others can do that as well as I can, this spring. Now being drowned by the flow of running water, I will read Whymper till lunch time.
