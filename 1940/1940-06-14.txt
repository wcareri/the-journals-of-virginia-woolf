### Friday 14 June

Paris is in the hands of the Germans. Battle continues. We spent the day seeing Penshurst with Vitaâ€”picnicked in the park. Gwen in military dressâ€”V. in trousers. Very fine & hot. The house of yellowish Oxford stone. Banqueting hall: disappointing furniture, like heavy & over ornamental Tot Court Rd. only made 1314â€”Q. Elizth dancingâ€”tilted up by Essex? Ladies & gents all sitting on the benches laughing. Elizabeth herself in another picture, delicate skinned red haired, aquiline. Then the shell of Lady Pembrokeâ€™s luteâ€”like half a fig. Then Sidneyâ€™s shaving glass. Then some very ugly tables â€¦ a long panelled room with soft veined panels. Out into the garden, which has certain trim lawns, & long grass walks, then lapses into wilderness. Sidneys very poorâ€”given up weeding. A great lily pond; the goldfish making an odd subacqueous tapping as they moved among reeds. Then through old pink courtyards, with the Boar & the broad arrow to the car: but the butler came & said his. Lordship wanted to see us. Vita wentâ€”we stayed. Then were summoned. Ld. de Lisle & Dudley is like a very old liver & white Sussex spanielâ€”heavy pouched, both eyes with cataract, 87 but looks younger, waistcoat undone. Glad of company. Easy going at his ease, loose limbed, twinkling. â€œDo you mind if I say itâ€”but the statue of the Q. outside Buck Palace is like a lady on a close stoolâ€”Showed that (Q. Charlotte) to Queen Mary. She didnt like it when I said it was like her.â€ Padded us into a small room; made us look at pictures said to be goodâ€”one, skied, of A. Sidney. Then a reputed Rembrandt. Can only keep a few rooms open. And those like seaside lodging roomsâ€”There we left him alone, blind, with his shilling box of cork tipped cigarettes, some patience or other game, a few novels, & the photographs of his nephew â€œâ€”a very nice boyâ€ & his grey lady the only signs of youth, on a side table. Vita said heâ€™d told her he was so poor he couldnt have people to stay: whole place run by 2 maids & a boy & butler; is aloneâ€”but dâ€™you mind being alone? she asked. â€œHate itâ€ he said. Twice a week he goes to Tonbridge & plays Bridge. There this old snail sits in the corner of his tremendous shell. The taste of the present Sidneys is all for carved tables & yellow varnish. He had hardly any fingers when we shook hands, each thanking him, & he was anxious to give us tea. But I must get back for my fire practice Gwen said. Whats the use? he remarked. Odd to have seen this Elizabethan great house the first day that invasion becomes serious. But I like MH better.
