### Sunday 17 November

I observe, as a curious trifle in mental historyâ€”I shd like to take naturalists notesâ€”human naturalists notesâ€”that it is the rhythm of a book that, by running in the head, winds one into a ball: & so jades one. The rhythm of PH. (the last chapter) became so obsessive that I heard it, perhaps used it, in every sentence I spoke. By reading the notes for memoirs I broke this up. The rhythm of the notes is far freer & looser. Two days of writing in that rhythm has completely refreshed me. So I go back to PH tomorrow. This I think is rather profound.

Butter stolen yesterday; Louie says â€œYou are too well liked for any villager to take itâ€”Had it been Mr Coatesâ€¦â€ This flatters us. A fight over Knotts Bushes. 6 little companies of exclamation marks. Supposed to be the shrapnel after the air gun shell. Two loud explosions. A great chase, & all the farm out watching. Dumb Thompsett making wild attempts at comment. Flood even higher. And the plumes of the sky in the waterâ€”& the wild birdsâ€”& L. cut down the rusty funereal trees today. And I lost the saw. I cannot fix my mind to details. The butter disappeared when we were playing bowls. A mans voice heard, & the card of St Dunstanâ€™s found in the door. Assumption then that the voluntary Collector took it.

A Canadian soldier stole Peterâ€™s bicycle pump. Two Miss Pounds left the house holding nothing in their hands. Mrs Chavasseâ€”Iâ€™m a lone womanâ€”always sleeps in her shelterâ€”a cellar, dripping wetâ€”Lord!â€”
