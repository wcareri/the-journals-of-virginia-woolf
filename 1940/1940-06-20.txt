London diary: just back; & dinner so close & events so crowded that I must abstract. Monday lunch: John. The French stopped fighting: whats to become of me? Offered a Roumanian bookshop. Then what about Press? KM. after dinner. Now we suffer what the Poles suffered. Fight in our fortress: are conquered: I have my morphia in pocket. Tuesday, dine with Adrian. They both off to air raid rehearsal at Middlesex hospl. Adrian promises us a prescription. Châ urchiâ ll broadcasts. Reassuring about defence of England; not all claptrap. Now weâ€™re fighting alone with our back to the wall. Bombs first, then invasion. Ethel Smyth tea. Oh of course we shall fight and win. Then Wednesday. Mrs Nicholls & daughter fled from air raid at Thetford. Tea with her & Eth Bowen. In comes L.: air raid practice at H. of C. Those are the skeleton facts of our 3 London days. Monday ended in charcoal gloom. KM. says we must & shall be beaten. He says perhaps 4 more numbers of NS will come out.

Here, as soon as we begin bowls, Louie comes agog. Harry came back on Monday. It pours outâ€”how he hadnt boots off for 3 days; the beach at Dunkirkâ€”the bombers as low as treesâ€”the bullets like moth holes in his coatâ€”how no English aeroplanes fought; how the officer told them to take their shoes off & go past a pill box on all fours. Then went himself with a grenade & blasted it. At Dunkirk many men shot themselves as the planes swooped. Harry swam off, a boat neared. Say Chum Can you row? Yes, he said, hauled in, rowed for 5 hours, saw England, landedâ€”didnt know if it were day or night or what townâ€”didnt askâ€”couldnâ€™t write to his motherâ€”so was despatched to his regiment. He looted a Belgian shop & stuffed his pockets with rings, which fell out in the sea; but 2 watches pinned to his coat survived: one is chased, & chimes. Mrs Everest has them. He saw his cousin dead on the beach; & another man from the street. He was talking to a chap, who showed him a silk handkerchief bought for his joy lady. That moment a bomb killed him. Harry took the handkerchief. Harry has had enoâ€™ war, & is certain of our defeatâ€”got no arms & no aeroplanesâ€”how can we do anything?
