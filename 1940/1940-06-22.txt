Is Harry the real animal behind the brave, laughing heroic boy panoply which the BBC spreads before us nightly?â€” a natural human being, not made for shooting men, but for planting potatoes, And is he, as I suspect, the average sample? I gather heâ€™d shoot himself rather than go to France again. And he hates the French, who gabble & become hysterical & run mad; & yet dont give him little loaves for nothing like the nice Belgian woman. So it was at Waterloo I suppose. And the fighting goes on in France; & the terms arenâ€™t yet public; & its a heavy grey day, & Iâ€™ve been beaten at bowls, feel depressed & irritated, & vow Iâ€™ll play no more, but read my book.

My book is Coleridge; Rose Macaulay; the Bessborough lettersâ€”rather a foolish flight inspired by Hary-o; I would like to find one book & stick to it. But cant. I feel, if this is my last lap, oughtnâ€™t I to read Shakespeare? But cant. I feel oughtnâ€™t I to finish off P.H.: oughtnâ€™t I to finish something by way of an end? The end gives its vividness, even its gaiety & recklessness to the random daily life. This, I thought yesterday, may be my last walk. On the down above Bugdean I found some green glass tubes. The corn was flowing with poppies in it. And I read my Shelley at night. How delicate & pure & musical & uncorrupt he & Coleridge read, after the left wing group. How lightly & firmly they put down their feet, & how they sing; & how they compact; & fuse, & deepen. I wish I cd invent a new critical methodâ€”something swifter & lighter & more colloquial & yet intense: more to the point & less composed; more fluid & following the flight, than my C.R. essays. The old problem: how to keep the flight of the mind, yet be exact. All the difference between the sketch & the finished work. And now dinner to cook. A role.
