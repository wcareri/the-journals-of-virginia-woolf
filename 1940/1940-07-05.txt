### Friday 5 July

Why should I be bothering myself with Coleridge I wonderâ€”Biog. Lit. & then with fatherâ€™s essay on Coleridge, this fine evening, when the flies are printing their cold little feet on my hands? It was in order to give up thinking about economy; whether to give up Mable. I wanted to think myself up into calmness. Economy, means that I must make money: thus when Dotty offers me Â£50 for an essay upon fiction, 10,000 words, I cut it up into articles, & reckon; no: thats poor pay. Iâ€™d better finish Pointz Hall.

I took my Times order to the post & there met Mrs Ebbs. â€œSo Mr Woolf has seen Monks House again!â€ she said. I of course said, â€œbut youâ€™ve been having fighting here.â€ Then she told me how the cups rattled in her hand, at tea, at Seaford, when the raider was fired at, & brought down at sea. â€œThe poor fellow, the engine driver was killed between Newhaven & Seafordâ€ she said. Also that the silly fellow who crashed his plane on the marsh, tipped its nose over the brook: He didnt know about the brooks. So I walked down & saw itâ€”a little gnat, with red & white & blue bars; a tent keeping guard. Louie said that Audrey Hubbard who was in the pea field ran to give first aid. The man had a face like two faces. She made him write his name on a cigarette card: he was taken to Lewes, & has lockjaw. But this is rumourâ€”rumour, via Percy, has it that the streets of Newhaven were machine gunned. L. gets annoyed with Percy. I see the imaginationâ€”that should have turned a wheel, running to waste & foam instead. L. back from the Library with a great volume of Giffordâ€™s Laws. So to bowls. The French Fleet fought: Petain cuts off diplomatic relations. So shall we be at war with our ally? Last month indissolubly determined to fight to the end.

If someone comes in one writes differently: now, having been beaten at bowls, in a high wind, hearing planes above,â€”I note: to remember: the circular walk at the Tower with the hollyhocks; & the little 1870 girl in white with bands of black looking out of the window in its deep wall, as Eth Bowen & I sat talking. We walked from 37 through Temple, along river, up Thames Street, to the Tower, talking talking about what? her going to Ireland on a Govt mission; leaving Clarence Terrace; writing, it was my â€˜greatnessâ€™ as we circled the town. No, I dont think it was only flattery I wanted. Something warmer. On top of bus, we talked againâ€”a good idea; talking in many changing scenes: it changes topics & moods, battling among the Billingsgate porters with their shelly fishy hats; then stopping: crossing: running up bus steps.

I forgot to record my idiotic anguish, the night the Hutchesâ€”J., M. & Jeremy dined, about my dress. How queer that wave of agony: about 2 in the morning: so overpowering & irrational. Next day I found Jeanne in Judd Street to alter it & recovered serenity, & even had, once more, the bright inspiration that Jeanne of Judd Streetâ€”a small brown moth of a womanâ€”who succeeded the old improper Frenchwomanâ€”shall make all my clothes in future, beautifully, & for nothing.
