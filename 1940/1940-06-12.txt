### Wednesday 12 June

Black news. French apparently withdrawing but only guarded news. Maurois begging for help last night. Percy says the little boats all summoned again, as if to fetch off more troops. Mrs Richardson (Lady Readingâ€™s gardeners wife) told me of a friend of her husbands dead on the beach at Dunkirkâ€”not a woundâ€”shock. The West boy writes heâ€™s hunting his battalionâ€”no clothesâ€”wonâ€™t go back he says; but gives no word of his wounds. Some say hes the only survivor of his regiment. Landed in a sailing boat at Ramsgate. Twined in with all thisâ€”& the fine weatherâ€”& the drill & drone of the planes at nightâ€”& Mabel hereâ€”& my long long Index makingâ€”twined in is E. Bowen: who dont answer, & is I suspect to be written off henceforth. Why? Is she a touchy? Is she a lover of rows? Really I dont know her well enough to diagnose. And how soon anger & sternness & complete disregard for this sort of twittering triviality come to oneâ€™s help. Iâ€™m not wounded in my vanity, for I cant play those games. So have drafted a letter, & shall send it on Fridayâ€”for Iâ€™m almost sure, in my bones, as L. wd say, that sheâ€™s set on a break. If the Index is finished tomorrow, thats the very last load home. Whether we publish or not, Iâ€™m quit.

No letters of any sort: & no Times book: but all the same I feel decks cleared & scrubbed, & can set to, in a jiffyâ€”oh dear, Iâ€™ve not thanked Shawâ€”yes, Iâ€™ll write all my letters tomorrow. I was asked to write a life of Margaret Bondfieldâ€”I forgot to say: also to contribute to some Womens Symposium in USA; and Judith is the only one to get a First.
