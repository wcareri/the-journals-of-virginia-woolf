### Easter Sunday 24 March

A curious sub-life has set in, rather spacious, rather leisured, & secluded & content. Still sleep in L.â€™s room; then I slowly bath & dress & sit in the sitting room, quietly, entering Mâ â 's corrections. Not much bothered really, though Iâ€™ve so short a time. I cant help thinking, in spite of L., that its interesting: & I can I think liven & improve. And Iâ€™m buoyed up by M. & N. & D. And feel in one fortnight I shall be quit (oh no, thereâ€™ll be proofs). This is an egg shell lifeâ€”so gingerly do I step to avoid rousing my temp: which was 99 pt 4 & is again a little up: but if I dont walk in the wind I think I can refrigerate, & yet keep my brain calm for the morning. Wobbly like one of the spring lambs in my legs. Mabel increases comfort 100 fold. And its refreshing & rejuvenating to see the gold thick clumps of crocuses, & the unopened green daffodils, & to hear my Asheham rooks dropping their husky caws through the gummy air. Birds are having a trial. L. works all the afternoon in his blue shirt making the rock garden. Old Botten is dying. Mabel & Louie have gone to church at Southease, & the Lambs bleat.

Iâ€™m beginning Sense & Sensibilityâ€”& reading about Apes. That reminds meâ€”to do a Câ . Râ . on Darwin. V. of the Beagle one section: Downe the other. So when Iâ€™m quit of R. & of the WEA I shall do little articlesâ€”& oh the relief of not having the whole building of a book on my shoulders! Of course thereâ€™ll be the wave splash in June, if we bring it out; but Iâ€™m fortified beforehandâ€”thats odd. The first book thats been read first by others. Dear me, thoâ€™, Iâ€™ve many paragraphs to rewrite, & thereâ€™s the end, & Helen still to comment. All the birds are sitting up in L. & V. The twig carrying has begun, & this goes on while all the guns are pointed & charged & no one dares pull the trigger. Not a sound this evening to bring in the human tears. I remember the sudden profuse shower one night just before war wh. made me think of all men & women weeping.
