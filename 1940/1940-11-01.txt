### Friday 1 November

A gloomy evening, spiritually: alone over the fireâ€”L. in bed with influenza cold: caught off Percy. So I am alone; & by way of conversation, apply to this too stout volume.

My Times book this week is E.Â F. Bensonâ€™s last autobiographyâ€”in which he tried to rasp himself clean of his barnacles. I learn there the perils of glibness. I too can flick phrases. He said â€œOne must discover new depths in oneself.â€ Well I dont bother about that here. I will note, thoâ€™, the perils of glibness. And add, considering how I feel in my fingers the weight of every word, even of a review, need I feel guilty?

The relics of my distracted morningâ€”I had to ring up Miss Talbotâ€”who was to come tomorrowâ€”&c &c, were spent tightening that wretched Â£150 story, The Legacy. Well, I combed & tidied itâ€”so far as â€˜itâ€™ has any hair on its head. Then dipped into my memoirs: too circuitous & unrelated: too many splutters: as it stands. A real life has no crisis: hence nothing to tighten. It must lack centre. It must amble on. All the same, I can weave a very thick pattern, one of these days, out of that pattern of detail. Then I carried L.â€™s lunch. Then I pumped my bicycle. Then I rode to Lewes. I saw a chocolate velvet Bradfield, & slid past. Early in the morning Annie came, asked me to stand for W.I. Cttee. â€œNoâ€ I cried too violently. The poor dont understand humour. I repented; went round later & found her in the sunny parlour with all the sistersâ  artificial carnations, & said I would. For I could see, by the pleasure she felt when I offered to nominate her, that she takes this infernal dull bore seriously: its an excitement. Two white Penfold brats. They run out like dogs she said chasing them. If one lives in a village, one had better snatch its offerings. Miss Talbot rang up. Sister too shy to come. Arranged both will comeâ€”oh dearâ€”next week. And the raid was bad last night. At 3 am. a bomb dropped 2 doors offâ€”seriously hurt a man. She said it was an English shell, unexploded. The Italians, she says, are practising: nosing in the darkâ€”as they did tâ€™other night here. This very simple self-conversation had better end with the pageâ€”paper being scarce, & so on.

I forgot to say that I heard of Hilda Mathesonâ€™s death today from Ethel. But she calls up no image.
