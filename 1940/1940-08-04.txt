Just time, while Judith & Leslie finish their game, to record oh a great reliefâ€”Desmondâ€™s review really says all I wanted said. The book delights friends & the younger generation say Yes, yes we know him; & its not only delightful but important. Thats enough. And it gave me a very calm rewarded feelingâ€”not the old triumph, as over a novel; but the feeling Iâ€™ve done what was asked of me, given my friends what they wanted. Just as Iâ€™d decided Iâ€™d given them nothing but the materials for a book I hadnt written. Now I can be content: neednâ€™t worry what people think: for Desmond is a good bell ringer; & will start the othersâ€”I mean, the talk among intimates will follow, more or less, his lines. Herbert Read & MacColl have bit their hardest; put their case; now only Morgan remains, & perhaps a poisoned dart from W. Lewis. I thought Iâ€™d mentioned Read: polite to me; very mean & spiteful about R.
