### Tuesday 22 October

Mabel has come. I thought I heard a rat gnawing when I came in from the marsh. Strode into the kitchen & found her there. So all our solitude is gone. There she is, passive, dependant. And how to make a move? Seems impossible. The old weight of respectable damp despair is on me. L. says sheâ€™s positively cheered by Charlesâ€™ deathâ€”after an operation at Tooting. â€œI could envy himâ€ she said to me this morning. â€œThey say Iâ€™ve grown fatterâ€”sitting doing nothingâ€

To Lewes. Asked the rent of Yew Tree houseâ€”Â£110, with a view to buying & storing. Denny Botten has rooms. Mrs Ebbs has a stable. Mrs Ebbs always reads â€œyour wifeâ€™s books. But doesnâ€™t understand themâ€”for the beautiful English.â€ I wish I didnâ€™t play bowls, & cd. settle in & write calmly or read. As it is, in I rush, having irritated L. who said he had bad luck; I won the 2nd gameâ€”too hasty to do more than black out before dinner.

Mable somewhere secretively observant. The vast ideas that float are never caught. I thought: how L. sees people in the mass: I singly. I thought biography is like the rim of sea anemones left round the shore in Gosseâ€™s Father & Son: I thought Beresford, Ruthâ€™s father, has been killed by a bomb: I thought, I will write supports & additions for my old TLS articles; a good deal about manners, & our class; about my rug (L. sneezes in the wc. I jump;) about a prayer for the Vâ ictorian scene in P.H.; no reply from Harpers. Gramophone mended but bad; if I wait the thought may return; a lovely almost a red admiral & apple day; 24 vols of diary salved; a great mass for my memoirs. The lazy talk of pregnant womenâ€”to wit, Mrs Cruttenden in the bakers shop; louâ nged out & stood in the sun; & now I will light the fire, as L. comes in with the logs. And so, rug, reading, music, bed.
