### Wednesday 20 March

Yes, another attackâ€”in fact 2 other attacks: one Sunday weekâ€”101 with Angelica there to put me to bed; tother last Friday, 102 after lunch. So to bed up here in L.â€™s room, & Dr Tooth, who keeps me in bed (where I sit up with L. reading proofs) till tomorrow. Thats the boring history. What they call recurring with slight bronchitis. Yes. And the Bookâ€™s read & cd. I write out my chart, it wd. be interesting. One Sunday (the 101 Sunday) L. gave me a very severe lecture on the first half. We walked in the meadows. It was like being pecked by a very hard strong beak. The more he pecked the deeper, as always happens. At last he was almost angry that Iâ€™d chosen â€œwhat seems to me the wrong method. Its merely analâ ysis, not history. Austere repression. In fact dull to the outsider. All those dead quotations.â€ His theme was that you cant treat a life like that: must be seen from the writers angle, unless the liver is himself a seer, wh. R. wasnt. It was a curious example of L. at his most rational & impersonal: rather impressive; yet so definite, so emphatic, that I felt convinced: I mean of failure; save for one odd gleam, that he was himself on the wrong tack, & persisting for some deep reasonâ€”dissympathy with R.? lack of interest in personality? Lord knows. I note this plaited strand in my mind; & even while we walked & the beak struck deeper deeper had this completely detached interest in L. character. Then Nessa came; disagreed: Margeryâ€™s letter â€œvery alive & interestingâ€; then L. read the 2nd half thought it ended on the doorstep at Bernard St.; then N.â€™s note â€œIâ€™m crying cant thank youâ€â€”then N. & D. to tea up here; forbid me to alter anything; then Margeryâ€™s final letterâ€”â€œIts him â€¦ unbounded admirationâ€. There I pause. Well, I think I re-write certain passages, have even in bed sketched them, but how in time for this spring? That I shelve till tomorrow. Great relief all the same. Its a slippery floor this: great flower pots; L. walking on his rubber soles; a plan to make this my bedroom: have a bath in cupboard. Yes, its a great relief. Suppose all the first half were to do againâ€”as Iâ€™d decidedâ€”3 months grind .. And Lord to be quit of it & freeâ€”& Lord to have given Nessa back her Roger, lost since Julian died. Also Iâ€™m rather proud of my tenacity & conscience in that book: & want toâ€”I suppose to increase my reputation, as biographer, when its sunk as novelist: want to be winging off on small articles & stories. Dog story brought in Â£170 today; a translation Â£20; & then Chaâ mâ brun says Harpers wants an essay on Ly Hester Stanhope: the book I read that Christmas at Lelant, & finished too soon, & put Lytton on the scent of. Yes; so Iâ€™m set up: & had a letter from Vita, who says weâ€™re out of touch, & she minds. Not on my side I reply. She dont answer. I write to say why dont you answer â€¦ I think thats a fair though fuggy & frowsty annal (hows it spelt?) of the past 2 weeks. Cold blue & white weather from my window. Mabel here. Suavity & capacity itself, thoâ€™ the usual strain with L. & Louie. War thought to be beginning. Peace with Finns. The G.â€™s raid Scapa. A disgrace. So we raid them. This may prelude a general attack. But why waste even this half inch upon these blaring & boring politics? Even Tooth, the red haired Dr whose name shd. be Hector told me he had no kind or sort of enthusiasm for this warâ€”yet had craved for the last. Yet we must stick it out he said. An average decent opinion.
