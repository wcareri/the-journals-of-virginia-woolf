### Friday 2 February

Met Nessa outside Uridges today so the frost of isolation is over. It was broken by a meeting though, at which I gossiped with Mrs Funnell & said Iâ€™d find her a dachshund. â€œDasshundâ€ she called it, being lower class.

I wish I could conglobulate reflections like Gide. Half of his are daily jottings. Then something solid forms. And they occur at breakfast, or when Iâ€™m up to my knees in mud. The lost thoughtsâ€”a fine covey theyâ€™d make if ever hivedâ€”the thoughts Iâ€™ve lost on Asheham down, & walking the river bank. Yesterday a smart car stopped: a glowing lady gave me a lift; burnished & aquiline like Bobo; said to be Mrs Drawbell of the hated house. The snow remains, slightly pocked, but the road is clear. The cream woman slipped another Â½lb of butter into my bag; the Coops, inserted a lb. of sugar instead of sago into our groceries. And Iâ€™m asked not only to write, combatively on peace, for The Forum, but they want to reprint Reviewing. So, what with the Statesman & The Listener, no doubt I could grind out a good many Guineas: & I enjoy the friction: keeps my mind warm, thinking lost thoughts.

Mabel coming (alas) tomorrow. Then London.

I forget to make extracts from the papers, which boom, echoing, emptily, the BBC. Hitlerâ€™s speechâ€”Churchillâ€™sâ€”a ship sunkâ€”no survivorsâ€”a raft capsizedâ€”men rowing for 10 or 12 or 30 hours. How little one can explode now, as perhaps one would have done, had it been a single death. But the Black Out is far more murderous than the war. Prices rise by 2d then 3d. So the screw tightens gradually; & I cant even imagine London in peaceâ€”the lit nights, the buses roaring past Tavistock Square, the telephone ringing, & I scooping together with the utmost difficulty one night or afternoon alone. A reminder to use the present astonishing space for Burke &c. Only the fire sets me dreamingâ€”of all the things I mean to write: the break in our lives from London to country is a far more complete one than any change of house. Yes, but I havent got the hang of it altogether. The immense space suddenly becomes vacant; then illuminated. And London, in nips, is cramped & creased. Odd how often I think with what is love I suppose of the City: of the walk to the Tower: that is my England; I mean, if a bomb destroyed one of those little alleys with the brass bound curtains & the river smell & the old woman reading I should feelâ€”well, what the patriots feelâ€”L. & Sally arrive.
