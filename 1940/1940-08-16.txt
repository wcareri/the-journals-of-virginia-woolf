Third edition ordered. L. said, at 37 on Wednesday â€œIts booming.â€ The boom is dulled by our distance. And why does a word of tepidity depress more than a word of praise exalts? I dont know. I refer to Waley: I dont refer to Pamelaâ€”great work of art &c. Well, Its taking its way. Its selling. Its done. And Iâ€™m writing PH. wh. leaves a spare hour. Many air raids. One as I walked. A haystack was handy. But walked on, & so home. All clear. Then sirens again. Then Judith & Leslie. Bowls. Then Mrs Ebbs &c to borrow table. All clear. I must make a stop gap for the last hour, or I shall dwindle, as Iâ€™m doing here. But PH. is a concentrationâ€”a screw. So I will go in, & read Hare & write to Ethel.

Very hot. Even out here.

They came very close. We lay down under the tree. The sound was like someone sawing in the air just above us. We lay flat on our faces, hands behind head. Dont close yr teeth said L. They seemed to be sawing at something stationary. Bombs shook the windows of my lodge. Will it drop I asked? If so, we shall be broken together. I thought, I think, of nothingnessâ€”flatness, my mood being flat. Some fear I suppose. Shd we take Mabel to garage. Too risky to cross the garden L. said. Then another came from Newhaven. Hum & saw & buzz all round us. A horse neighed on the marsh. Very sultry. Is it thunder? I said. No guns, said L. from Ringmer, from Charleston way. Then slowly the sound lessened. Mabel in kitchen said the windows shook. Air raid still on, distant planes. Leslie playing bowls. I well beaten.

My books only gave me pain, Ch. BrontÃ« said. Today I agree. Very heavy dull & damp. This must at once be cured. The all clear. 5 to 7. 144 down last night.
