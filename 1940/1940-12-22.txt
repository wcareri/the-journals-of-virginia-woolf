### Sunday 22 December

How beautiful they were, those old peopleâ€”I mean father & motherâ€”how simple, how clear, how untroubled. I have been dipping into old letters & fathers memoirs. He loved herâ€”oh & was so candid & reasonable & transparentâ€”& had such a fastidious delicate mind, educated, & transparent. How serene & gay even their life reads to me: no mud; no whirlpools. And so humanâ€”with the children & the little hum & song of the nursery. But if I read as a contemporary I shall lose my childs vision & so must stop. Nothing turbulent; nothing involved: no introspection.
