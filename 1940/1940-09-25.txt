### Wednesday 25 September

It must have been the next day that the Anrep crisis happened. They had taken the cottage, Nessa told me, indefinitely: Helen & the 2 oafs. Then I lost my temper, more than for years. Sure enough they came on Monday. Had I time I would detail my great philosophic scheme for organising emotions for the length of their stay. Every fortnight a decorous tea. A letter to Helen explaining â€¦ & so on. Then, like a Star arising, Nessa wrote (we are cold & distant, after our wrangle) that they stay only a week. Wellâ€”I cannot now dissect my maneuvres. All dayâ€”Mondayâ€”in London I was composing my attitude; in the flat; dark; carpets nailed to windows; ceilings down in patches; heaps of grey dust & china under kitchen table; back rooms untouched. A lovely Septr dayâ€”tenderâ€”three days of tender weatherâ€”John came. We are moved to Letchworth. The Garden City was moving us that day. Roger surprisingly sells. The bomb in Brunswick Sqre exploded. I was in the bakers. Comforted the agitated worn women. Then letters, from Arthur Ponsonby & Lord Bicester & Christabel from the choked maw of the post office. So home. And now, constricted by the Anreps in the village, I plan a tea say Saturday; clench my teeth, shut my eyes; & after that, to the peace of this empty house, & renewed country. Invasion again withdraws.
