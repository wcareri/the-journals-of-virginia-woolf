### Wednesday 26 February

My â€˜higher lifeâ€™ is almost entirely the Elizabethan play. Finished Pointz Hall, the Pageant: the Playâ€”finally Between the Acts this morning. Flora & Molly have just gone; leaving me to ask this bitter bright spring day, why they came?

Yesterday in the ladies lavatory at the Sussex Grill at Brighton I heard:

Sheâ€™s a little simpering thing. I dont like her. But then he never did care for big women. (So to Bert) His eyes are so blue. Like blue pools. Soâ€™s Gertâ€™s. They have the same eyes, only her teeth part a little. He has wonderful white teeth. He always had. Its fun having the boys â€¦ If he dont look out heâ€™ll be court martialed.

They were powdering & painting, these common little tarts, while I sat, behind a thin door, pâ€”ing as quietly as I could.

Then at Fullerâ€™s. A fat, smart woman, in red hunting cap, pearls, check skirt, consuming rich cakes. Her shabby dependant also stuffing. Hudsonâ€™s van unloading biscuits opposite. The fat woman had a louche large white muffin face. Tâ€™other was slightly grilled. They ate & ate. Talked about Mary. But if sheâ€™s very ill, youâ€™ll have to go to her. Youre the only oneâ€¦. But why should she be?â€¦.. I opened the marmalade but John doesnt like itâ€”And we have two pounds of biscuits in the tin upstairsâ€¦. Something scented, shoddy, parasitic about them. Then they totted up cakes. And passed the time oâ€™ day with the waitress. Where does the money come to feed these fat white slugs? Brighton a love corner for slugs. The powdered the pampered the mildly improper. I invested them in a large house in Sussex Sqre. We cycled. Irritated as usual by the blasphemy of Peacehaven. Helen has fallen through, I mean the house I got her with Enid Jones, the day Enid lunched here, with Vita; & I felt so untidy yet cool; & she edgy & brittle. No walks for ever so long. People daily. And rather a churn in my mind. And some blank spaces. Food becomes an obsession. I grudge giving away a spice bun. Curiousâ€”age, or the war? Never mind. Adventure. Make solid. But shall I ever write again one of those sentences that gives me intense pleasure? There is no echo in Rodmellâ€”only waste air. I spent the afternoon at the school, marbling paper. Mrs D. discontented. & said, Theres no life in these children, comparing them with Londoners, thus repeating my own comment upon that long languid meeting at Chavasses. No life: & so they cling to us. This is my conclusion. We pay the penalty for our rung in society by infernal boredom.
