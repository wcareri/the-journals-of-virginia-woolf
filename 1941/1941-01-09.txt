### Thursday 9 January

A blank. All frost. Still frost. Burning white. Burning blue. The elms red. I did not mean to describe, once more, the downs in snow; but it came. And I cant help even now turning to look at Asheham down, red, purple, dove blue grey, with the cross so melodramatically against it. What is the phrase I always rememberâ€”or forget. Look your last on all things lovely.

Yesterday Mrs Dedman was buried upside down. A mishap. Such a heavy woman, as Louie put it, feasting spontaneously upon the grave. Today she buries the Aunt whose husband saw the vision at Seaford. Their house was bombed by the bomb we heard early one morning last week. And L. is lecturing & arranging the room. Are these the things that are interesting? that recall; that say Stop you are so fair? Well, all life is so fair, at my age. I mean, without much more of it I suppose to follow. And tâ€™other side of the hill thereâ€™ll be no rosy blue red snow. I am copying P.H. I am economising. I am to spend nothing. One day, 11 years ago I spent Â£2.2 on glass jars. That was the loosening of the purseâ€”& I said it was difficult. Is it difficult now to string tight? The great change isnt that but the change to the country. Miss Gardner instead of Elizabeth Bowen. Small beer. But, space, silence; & time. I can sit down to a book. This I havent done since 1924, I suppose when we went to 52: & the scrimmage began. Oh but Iâ€™m so tormented by the evening beauty, & I assure you Asheham down is purple pink. And the smoke, rolling like a convolutedâ€”should I dare to say bowel?â€”is incandescent. Juliette has a boy. Elaine has the measles; & to conclude the marsh is of the colour & substance of an opaque emerald. Many mad letters from adoring women. I never like or respect my admirers, always my detractors. Desmondâ€™s book has come. Dipping I find it small beer. Too Irish, too confidential, too sloppy & depending upon the charm of the Irish voice. Yet Iâ€™ve only dipped, I say to quiet my critical conscience, which wont let me define things so easily. Bardia taken.
