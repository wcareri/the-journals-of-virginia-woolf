### Friday 7 February

Why was I depressed? I cannot remember.

We have been to Charlie Chaplin. Like the milk girl we found it boring. I have been writing with some glow. Mrs Thrale is to be done before we go to Cambridge. A week of broken water impends. Cambridge; then Elizabeth Bowen; then Vita & Enid Jones. Helen has repaid me Â£25. Do I like her better for it? I think so. The snow came back. Marshes in the thaw a swamp. We were in London, & had to come home, owing to a bomb, by Dorking; the car was locked at Martinâ€™s; we dined at the White Hartâ€”poor soup & oxtail; London streets are very emptyâ€”Oxford Street a wide grey ribbon. My red purse bag stolen & L. gave me another. At Charleston Clive was stockish, like a Bell. I said â€œWhat a risk Nessa ran marrying him!â€ The Sitwells are proving their existence as poets in the Law Courtsâ€”This is despicable but delightful. And what else? Terry appears today in the N.S. The Italians are flying. The 3rd week in March is fixed for invasion. Now black out, & perhaps write to Mary. No I think readâ€”what? I must tune up for my Elizabethans.
