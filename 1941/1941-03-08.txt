### Saturday 8 March

Just back from L.â€™s speech at Brighton. Like a foreign town: the first spring day. Women sitting on seats. A pretty hat in a teashopâ€”how fashion revives the eye! And the shell encrusted old women, rouged, decked, cadâ averous at the tea shop. The waitress in checked cotton.

No: I intend no introspection. I mark Henry Jamesâ€™s sentence: Observe perpetually. Observe the oncome of age. Observe greed. Observe my own despondency. By that means it becomes serviceable. Or so I hope. I insist upon spending this time to the best advantage. I will go down with my colours flying. This I see verges on introspection; but doesnâ€™t quite fall in. Suppose, I bought a ticket at the Museum; biked in daily & read history. Suppose I selected one dominant figure in every age & wrote round & about. Occupation is essential. And now with some pleasure I find that its seven; & must cook dinner. Haddock & sausage meat. I think it is true that one gains a certain hold on sausage & haddock by writing them down.

Last night I analysed to L. my London Library complex. That sudden terror has vanished; now Iâ€™m plucked at by the H. Hamilton lunch that I refused. To right the balance, I wrote to Stephen & Tom: & will write to Ethel & invite myself to stay; & then to Miss Sharp who presented me with a bunch of violets. This to make up for the sight of Oxford Street & Piccadilly which haunt me. Oh dear yes, I shall conquer this mood. Its a question of being open sleepy, wide eyed at presentâ€”letting things come one after another. Now to cook the haddock.
