### Wednesday 1 January

On Sunday night, as I was reading about the great fire, in a very accurate detailed book, London was burning. 8 of my city churches destroyed, & the Guildhall. This belongs to last year. This first day of the new year has a slice of a windâ€”like a circular saw. Leslie H. came to lunch; said um-um so often I nearly goggled; he was discussing the foundations of communism, having come chiefly to pick L.â€™s brain. Gossip in between; then old Octavia came, with her market womans basket. Great white bottles of milk & cream. L. looking at the comet. Rather a strong moon, & so cant identify the constellation. Mrs Coleridge Taylor tapped at the door; about a concert. And now its close on cooking time. This book was salvaged from 37: I brought it down from the shop, with a handful of Elizabethans for my book, now called â€œTurning a Pageâ€. A psychologist would see that the above was written with someone, & a dog, in the room. To add in private: I think I will be less verbose here perhapsâ€”but what does it matter, writing too many pages. No printer to consider, no public.
