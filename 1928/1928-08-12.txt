Shall I now continue this soliloquy, or shall I imagine an audience, which will make me describe?

This sentence is due to the book on fiction which I am now writingâ€”once more, O once more. It is a hand to mouth book. I scribble down whatever I can think of about Romance, Dickens &c. must hastily gorge on Jane Austen tonight & dish up something tomorrow. All this criticism however may well be dislodged by the desire to write a story. The Moths hovers some where at the back of my brain. Janie & Julian have just gone. Julian a little in the style of Jem, only so much saner: broad browed, wavy haired, vast, fat, powerful, good-tempered. He still laughs a great deal; but perhaps less than he did. Perhaps he is sticking his pitchfork in the ground. Janie is a little lapdog girl; like those pug faced prominent eyed wrinkled nosed little dogs that women carry about the streets; intelligent, vivacious, opening her mouth wide & snapping it shut; on one side a carpenters granddaughterâ€”on the other a Strachey. Perhaps a little common do I mean? But Clive yesterday at Charleston said that there were no class distinctions. We had tea from bright blue cups under the pink light of the giant hollyhock. We were all a little drugged with the country: a little bucolic I thought. It was lovely enoughâ€”made me envious of its country peace: the trees all standing securelyâ€”why did my eye catch the trees? The look of things has a great power over me. Even now, I have to watch the rooks heating up against the wind, which is high. & still I say to myself instinctively â€œWhats the phrase for that?â€ & try to make more & more vivid the roughness of the air current & the tremor of the rooks wing (deep breasting it) slicingâ€”as if the air were full of ridges & ripples & roughnesses; they rise & sink, up & down, as if the exercise (pleased them) rubbed & braced them like swimmers in rough water. But what a little I can get down with my pen of what is so vivid to my eyes, & not only to my eyes: also to some nervous fibre or fan like membrane in my spine. Janie Julian Leonard & I sat in the orchard till the wind got too strong, & I made them come out on the marsh & was sorry the river was low, or they might have praised it. And (irrelevantly) Miss Ritchie praises Orlando, & I was pleased till I thought, perhaps this is gratitude for our Â£20. Yet I dont think much either way about Orlando. Odd, how I feel myself under orders; always marching on a definite stage with each book, thoâ€™ it is one I set myself. And Duncan at Charleston was a little too aloof & supercilious seeming.
