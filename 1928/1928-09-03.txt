### Monday 3 September

The battle of Dunbar, the Battle of Worcester, & the death of Cromwellâ€”how often it seems to me I said that to my father (â€œmyâ€ father, not â€˜fatherâ€™ any more) at St Ives; standing bolt upright in the dining room at Talland House. And it is a perfect 3rd of September day. Leonard gave me the blue glass jug today, because he was cross when I slapped his nose with sweet peas, & because I was nice to his mother; & when I went into luncheon I saw it on the table. Indeed, I almost cried. He went to Brighton to get it for me. â€œI thought of it just as I was getting into the carâ€ he said. Perhaps I have analysed his motives wrongly.

Seldom have I felt as tired as I did last night. This shaky ramshackle old lady of 76 wore us out. Her talkâ€”I have written it for Nessa so cannot repeatâ€”never stops; never follows a line; is always about people; starts anywhere; at any moment; breaks into a Schubert trio: did you know Len that Mr Harris lives in Gordon Sqre? So on to his daughters; how she met one playing bridge &c. What makes it difficult is that she divines states of feeling to some extent, & would say pointedly â€œYou must often think of your writing when you are not writing, Virginiaâ€, when through exhaustion I became silent. I had one moment of peculiar & acute discomfort this morning, when she became â€˜intimateâ€™, & said how much she had been touched when I sat beside her in the car yesterday. Why did I hate it so? I felt the horror of family life, & the terrible threat to oneâ€™s liberty that I used to feel with father, Aunt Mary or George. It is an emotion one never gets from any other human relationship. She had the right to exact this on my part; & would feel pleasure & pain irrationally, & somehow put her claws in me. These feelings are as violent as any. And there was the sentimental, yet very vain & almost insanely selfish discourse about her love for her children; how theyâ€”these dull plain serviceable Jews & Jewessesâ€”were all splendid men & women; at which my gorge rose. How strangely she made everything commonplace, ugly, suburban, notwithstanding a charm too: something fresh & vital such as old women have, & not, I think, old men. But to be attached to her as daughter would be so cruel a fate that I can think of nothing worse; & thousands of women might be dying of it in England today: this tyranny of mother over daughter, or father; their right to the due being as powerful as anything in the world. And then, they ask, why women dont write poetry. Short of killing Mrs W. nothing could be done. Day after day oneâ€™s life would be crumpled up like a bill for 10 penâ ce 3 farthings. Nothing has ever been said of this.
