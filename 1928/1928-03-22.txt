### Thursday 22 March

There are the last pages at the end of Orlando, & it is twenty five minutes to one; & I have written everything I have to write, & on Saturday we go abroad.

Yes its doneâ€”Orlandoâ€”begun on 8th October, as a joke; & now rather too long for my liking. It may fall between stools, be too long for a joke, & too frivolous for a serious book. All this I dismiss from a mind avid only of green fields. The sun; wine; sitting doing nothing. I have been for the last 6 weeks rather a bucket than a fountain; sitting to be shot into by one person after another. A rabbit that passes across a shooting gallery, & oneâ€™s friends go pop-pop. Heaven be praised, Sibyl today puts us off, which leaves Dadie only, & a whole days solitude, please Heaven, tomorrow. But I intend to control this rabbit shooting business when I come back. And money making. I hope to settle in & write one nice little discreet article for Â£25 each month; & so live; without stress; & so readâ€”what I want to read. At 46 one must be a miser; only have time for essentials.

But I think I have made moral reflections enough, & should describe people, save that, when seen so colourlessly, by duty not wish, oneâ€™s mind is a little slack in taking notes. Morgan & Desmond were here to tea. Morgan more of the blue butterfly than ever. Unless I talk, he says nothing. And any shadow sends him flitting. Desmond comes in, round as a billiard ball; & this is true of his dear bubbling lazy mind; which has such a glitter & lustre now from mere being at ease in the world that it puts me into a good temper to be with him. He describes, analyses, narrates; does not actually talk. All his blandishments are now active to get articles for â€œLife & Lettersâ€ which comes out in May. I am scarcely flattered now to be asked; yet of course dashed a little when I refuse Mrs van Dorenâ€™s Â£120 & she takes no notice. And a little dashed, too, not to get the Femina prizeâ€”partly because Iâ€™ve been exhibited as a competitor & people will think me dashed: which Iâ€™m not, innately.

Roger & Helen, Ka & Will, the other night. Roger malicious a little, & vain. â€œI am the most read critic in England, & yet I have nowhere to write.â€ Analysed, this amounts to the fact that The Nation only pays him Â£5, & Konody gets more, & the pages of the Burlington are more thumbed at his articles than at MacCollâ€™s. There is an innocence in this vanity which is likeable; but I am touchy for the reputation of Bloomsbury. I thought I could see Ka & Will comparing us, & being glad we were not impeccable. They compare us with the political world: we them with our own. Will lay with his eyes shut, & I was rather sorry for him. He knows what Roger thinks of his pictures, & what I donâ€™t thinkâ€”for I dont look at them; but he has the generosity to praise my books. We middleaged people now scarcely covet each others good opinion very seriously: are content to be different.

Watery blowy weather; & this time next week we shall be in the middle of France.
