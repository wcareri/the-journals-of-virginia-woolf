### Friday 4 May

And now theres the Femina prize to record before I go off this brilliant summer day to tea with Miss Jenkins in Doughty Street. I am going dutifully, not to snub the female young. But I shall be overpowering I doubt not. But it is a wonderful day.

The prize was an affair of dull stupid horror: a function; not alarming; stupefying. Hugh Walpole saying how much he disliked my books; rather, how much he feared for his own. Little Miss Robins, like a red breast, creeping out. I remember your motherâ€”the most beautiful Madonna & at the same time the most complete woman of the world. Used to come & see me in my flat (I see this as a summer visit on a hot day). She never confided. She would suddenly say something so unexpected, from that Madonna face, one thought it vicious. This I enjoyed: nothing else made much impression. Afterwards there was the horror of having looked ugly in cheap black clothes. I cannot control this complex. I wake at dawn with a start. Also the â€˜fameâ€™ is becoming vulgar & a nuisance. It means nothing; & yet takes oneâ€™s time. Americans perpetually. Croly; Gaige; offers:

We have seen an endless number of peopleâ€”Eddie, Lytton, Miss Ritchie, Francis, Vita,â€”& now the minute Jenkins.
