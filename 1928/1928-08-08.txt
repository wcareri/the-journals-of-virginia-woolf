### Wednesday 8 August

Eddy has just gone, leaving me the usual feeling: why is not human intercourse more definite, tangible: why arenâ€™t I left holding a small round substance, say of the size of a pea, in my hand; something I can put in a box & look at? There is so little left. Yet these people one sees are fabric only made once in the world; these contacts we have are unique; & if E. were, say killed tonight, nothing definite would happen to me; yet his substance is never again to be repeated. Our meeting isâ€”but the thread of this idea slips perpetually; constantly though it recurs, with sadness, to my mind: how little our relationships matter; & yet they are so important: in him, in me, something to him, to me, infinitely sentient, of the highest vividness, reality. But if I died tonight, he too would continue. Something illusory then enters into all that part of life. I am so important to myself: yet of no importance to other people: like the shadow passing over the downs. I deceive myself into thinking that I am important to other people: that makes part of my extreme vividness to myself: as a matter of fact, I dont matter; & so part of my vividness is unreal; gives me a sense of illusion. Eddy says he thinks â€œWhat impression am I making?â€ constantly & is agitated: as a matter of fact, he is probably making no impression: his agitation is about nothing: he is mistaken.

But, superficially speakingâ€”for fundamentally I was thinking a thousand other thoughts; his presence was only I suppose a light on the surface of my mindâ€”something green or iron-coloured or greyâ€”while the water itself rushed on, in its old fierce wayâ€”thoughts about my writing; & about old age; & about buying the field (we bought it this morning) & about the children being noisy; & if I had bought Southease. All this went on sub-cutaneously. Yet his presence somehow checked the flow of sub-cutaneous life. I was always having to think what comes next? How am I to break into this other life which is 6 inches off mine in the deck chair in the orchard? So that my own thoughts could not flow deep or rapid, as they are doing now that Eddy is on his way to Tunbridge Wells. And what remains of Eddy is now in some ways more vivid, though more transparent, all of him composing itself in my mind, all I could get of him, & making itself a landscape appropriate to it; making a work of art for itself.

I am, as I write, wherever I come to a stop, looking out of the lodge window, at our field; & the little cottage boys with the cursed shrill voices, playing cricket half way down it; & as usual I am sentimental & worried. Children playing: yes, & interrupting me; yes & I have no children of my own; & Nessa has; & yet I dont want them any more, since my ideas so possess me; & I detest more & more interruption; & the slow heaviness of physical life, & almost dislike peoples bodies, I think, as I grow older; & want always to cut that short, & get my utmost fill of the marrow, of the essence.

I write thus partly in order to slip the burden of writing narrative, as for instance; we came here a fortnight ago. And we lunched at Charleston & Vita came & we were offered the field & we went to see the farm at Lime Kiln. Yet no doubt I shall be more interested, come 10 years, in facts; & shall want, as I do when I read, to be told details, details, so that I may look up from the page & arrange them too, into one of those makings up which seem so much truer done thus, from heaps of nonassorted facts, than now I can make them, when it is almost immediately being done (by me) under my eyes. It was a fine day, last Monday I rather think; & we drove through Ripe; & there was a girl & her feller at the gate in a narrow lane; & we had to interrupt them to turn the motor. I thought how the things they had been saying were dammed, like a river, by our interruption; & they stood there half amused, yet impatient, telling us to go to the left, but the road was up. They were glad when we went; yet gave us a flash of interest. Who are these people in their motor car: where are they going?â€”& then this sunk beneath the mind, & they forgot us completely. We went on. And then we reached the farm. The oasts had umbrella spokes poking out at the top: all was so ruined & faded. The Tudor farm house was almost blind; very small eyebrowed windows; old Stuart farmers must have peered out over the flat land, very dirty, ill-kempt, like people in slums. But they had dignity: at least thick walls; fireplaces; & solidity whereas now the house is lived in by one old, weedy pink faced man, who flung himself in his armchair. Go where you likeâ€”go anywhere, he said, loose jointed, somehow decayed, like the hop oasts; & damp like the mildewed carpets, & sordid, like the beds with the pots sticking out under them. The walls were sticky; the furniture mid Victorian; little light came through. It was all dying, decaying; & he had been there 50 years, & it will drop to pieces, since there is not enough beauty or strength to make anyone repair it.
