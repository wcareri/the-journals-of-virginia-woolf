### Monday 17 September

I have precisely 5 minutes before dinner. Quentin has swallowed those precious two hours in which I was to have read Dorothy Osborne: Quentin grown elegant & self conscious, liking to use French words; very sophisticated, showing in every movement now the shadow of our faults, as a set; uneasy, I doubt not; quick, sensitive; but wanting something of Julianâ€™s force & simplicity. So they change parts, growing, changing, turning from fat to thin. The drawing room smells with his paintsâ€”the gramophone like Moby Dick is white. Rachel came in with Angelica. She has quicksilver eyes, mended stockings, all the charm & dexterity of a poor clever manâ€™s child, whose wits are kept brushed, who mends her stockings, who lives on her adventures.

Desmond was here, talking the other day: intimate again, & yet too urbane, perhaps; or do I think this from the letter that so annoyed meâ€”speaking of my paperâ€™s â€œbutterfly lightnessâ€â€”how angry I was, how depressed I became. Leonard agrees that he has a complex, which leads him to belittle & fondle thus.
