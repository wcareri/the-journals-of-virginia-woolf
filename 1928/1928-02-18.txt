### Saturday 18 February

I am happy to say I have still a few pounds in the Bank, & my own cheque book too. This great advance in dignity was made in the autumn. Out of my Â£60 I have bought a Heal bed; a cupboard, a fur coat, & now a strip of carpet for the hall. This financial revision has been a great success. And I pan out articles so as to write one & earn Â£30 a month. And I should be revising Lord Chesterfield at this moment, but Iâ€™m not. My mind is woolgathering away about Women & Fiction, which I am to read at Newnham in May. The mind is the most capricious of insectsâ€”flitting fluttering. I had thought to write the quickest most brilliant pages in Orlando yesterdayâ€”not a drop came, all, forsooth, for the usual physical reasons, which declared themselves today. It is the oddest feeling: as if a finger stopped the flow of the ideas in the brain: it is unsealed, & the blood rushes all over the place. Again, instead of writing O. Iâ€™ve been racing up & down the whole field of my lecture. And tomorrow, alas, we motor; for I must get back into the bookâ€”which has brightened the last few days satisfactorily. Not that my sensations in writing are an infallible guide.

We dined with Ka. She had unshaded all Nessaâ€™s lamps, & somehow commonplaced the house strangely. It was full too of those derelicts whom she collectsâ€”the earnest, the ugly, the unhappy. Never have I sat next such driftwood as Mrs Campbell. Garnett was as badâ€”an overeducated prig. So tired I cant talkâ€”three large committees this afternoonâ€”gave accurate information about cooking eggs.

Before that, there was Todd & Cliveâ€”Clive is ubiquitous. Todd like some primeval animal emerging from the swamp, muddy, hirsute. A woman who is commercialâ€”rather an exception in my world. She spoke of â€œgetting my money backâ€ as Gerald Duckworth might have spoken with the same look of rather hostile & cautious greed, as though the world were banded to rob her. This money-grubbing way is not attractive; but it is lightened by a shimmer of dash & â€˜chicâ€™ even. She stands on her two feet as she expresses it. She is starting a paperâ€”Iâ€™m so bored with people starting papers in May! Thereâ€™s Desmond for another. But Todd has none of his bubble & gush. She finds work very dull. She likes life. flirting with Osbert I presume. She is tapir like, & the creatures nose snuffs pertinaciously after Bloomsbury.

Dadie came in for a moment, rather drawn & white, â€˜making moneyâ€™ too. We are a little out of that, Leonard & I: L. never makes a penny; I mean tries to: & I could almost wish we were more lavish in our ways. This is occasionally in my thoughts. And what else is? I doubt that I shall ever write another novel after O. I shall invent a new name for them.

Lunch with Mary; lunch with Clive; dinner with Clive; tea with Jane, raised in bed, with her old white head lifted up, on pillows, very aged & rather exalted, able only to talk or listen for 10 minutes or so. Mary & Jack simmering with polished domestic affluence & prettiness: gay bunches everywhere; & paint, & carpets; but not much backing to it. Jack develops, before 3 strikes, the storytelling manner: by 3.30 all the stories are told. Home to shabbiness.
