### Tuesday 18 December

Here I should be pegging away at Fiction; rather an interesting little book I think; but I cannot get my mind down on to it, like a bird of prey firmly attached. I was switched off to write a eulogy of Lady Strachey, burnt yesterday with a bunch of our red & white carnations on top of her. It is odd how little her death means to meâ€”for this reason. About a year ago she was said to be dying; & at once (Adrian told me) I made up my usual visualisation; felt the whole emotion of Lady Stracheyâ€™s passingâ€”her memories & so onâ€”that night; & then she did not die; & now when she does die, not a vision, not an emotion comes my way. These little tricks of psychology amuse me.

L. has just been in to consult about a 3rd edition of Orlando. This has been ordered; we have sold over 6000 copies; & sales are still amazingly briskâ€”150 today for instance; most days between 50 & 60; always to my surprise. Will they stop or go on? Anyhow my room is secure. For the first time since I married 1912â€”1928â€”16 yearsâ€”I have been spending money. The spending muscle does not work naturally yet. I feel guilty; put off buying, when I know that I should buy; & yet have an agreeable luxurious sense of coins in my pocket beyond my weekly 13/- which was always running out, or being encroached upon. Yesterday I spent 15/- on a steel brooch. I spent Â£3 on a mother of pearl necklaceâ€”& I havenâ€™t bought a jewel for 20 years perhaps! I have carpeted the dining roomâ€”& so on. I think oneâ€™s soul is the better for this lubrication; & I am going to spend freely, & then write, & so keep my brain on the boil. All this money making originated in a spasm of black despair one night at Rodmell 2 years ago. I was tossing up & down on those awful waves: when I said that I could find a way out. (For part of my misery was the perpetual limitation of everything; no chairs, or beds, no comfort, no beauty; & no freedom to move: all of which I determined there & then to win). And so came, with some argument, even tears one night (& how seldom I have ever cried!) to an agreement with Leonard about sharing money after a certain sum; & then opened a bank account; & now, at the lowest shall have Â£200 to put there on Jan. 1st. The important thing is to spend freely, without fuss or anxiety; & to trust to oneâ€™s power of making moreâ€”Indeed, I cannot at this moment very seriously doubt that I shall earn more, this next 5 years, than ever before.

But to return to Max Beerbohm. I met him at Ethelâ€™s the other night. As I came in a thick set old man (such was my impression) rose, & I was introduced. No freakishness, no fancy about him. His face is solidified; has a thick moustache; a red veined skin, heavy lines; but then his eyes are perfectly round, very large, & sky blue. His eyes become dreamy & merry when the rest of him is well groomed & decorous in the extreme. He is brushed, neat, urbane. Halfway through dinner he turned to me & we began a â€˜niceâ€™, interesting, flattering, charming kind of talk; he told me how he had read an article on Addison at Bognor during the war; when literature seemed extinct; & there was his own name. I daresay V.W. catches your eye as M.B. does mine. And nothing has encouraged me more. So I said, as I think, that he is immortal. In a small way, he said; but with complacency. Like a jewel which is hard & flawless, yet always changing. A charming image he said, very kind, approving, & what half flattered half saddened me, equal. Am I on that level? Virginia Woolf saysâ€”V.W. thinksâ€”how do you write? & so on: I was one of his colleagues & fellows in the art of writing; but not I hoped quite so old. Anyhow he asked me how I wrote. For he hacks every step with his pen, & therefore never alters. He thought I wrote like this. I told him I had to cut out great chunks. I wish you would send them to me, he said; simply; Indeed, he was nothing if not kind; but looked long & steadily. Looked at Lord David â€”that queer painters look, so matching, so considering apart from human intent; yet with him not entirely. After dinner, he leant on the mantelpiece & Maurice Baring & I flittered round him like a pair of butterflies, praising, laughing, extravagant. And he said he was so pleased by the praise of intelligent people like ourselves. But always he had to be led off to talk politely to this person & that; finally disappeared, very dignified, very discreet in his white waistcoat, pressing my hand in his plump firm one long; & saying what a pleasure &c. I own that I dont find much difference between the great & ourselvesâ€”indeed they are like us: I mean they dont have the frills & furbelows of the small; come to terms quickly & simply. But we got, of course, very little way. He talked of Hardy, & said he couldnt bear Jude the Obscure: thought it falsified life, for there is really more happiness than sorrow in life, & Hardy tries to prove the opposite. And his writing is so bad. Then I ran downâ€”but he reads my essays & knows thisâ€”Belloc. M.B. said that Belloc, one must remember, poured out ten books a year on history poetry &c. He was one of those full unequal people who were never perfect, as he, M.B., might be called perfect in a small way. But he was glad I didnt like him. Charles Lamb had the most beautiful things in him & then he spoilt them. He had never read a book except Pendennis & Tess of the dâ€™Urbervilles till he left Oxford. And now at last, at Rapallo, he reads. He is taking back Elizabeth & Orlando (pronounced in the French way) to read; treats he looks forward to.

Among others were present â€¦ Mrs Hammersley, Lord David, Hutchinsons, &c.

And we dined last night with the Hutchinsons & met George Moorâ eâ€”like an old silver coin now, so white so smooth; with his little flipper hands, like a walruses; & his chubby cheeks, & little kneesâ€”yet always saying the thing that comes into his head; fresh, juvenile almost for that reason; & very shrewd. Gave a description of Riceyman Stepsâ€”the ferns covered in dust, the man with cancer marrying the woman with fitsâ€”Not what one calls a distinguished mindâ€”& what a subject to choose! It seems as if he attaches much importance to subject. He was always praising or altering ways of treating stories. He is writing some Greek novel now, dictating to a charming lady, who has every virtue, save that she is not forthcoming & therefore will not marry. He dictates, & this gives him something to bite upon: then he re-dictates. He never writes. There are no mss of his in existence. Perhaps the dictated style is a true account of his style & Hâ enry Jâ amesâ€™s & accounts for their fluidity, their verbosity. And what it comes to is that the great are very simple; quick to come to terms with; reserved; & dont pay any attention to other peoples books (Moore throws scorn on them allâ€”Shawâ€”a shriek of vulgarityâ€”poisoned with vulgarityâ€”never wrote a good sentence in his lifeâ€”Wellsâ€”I spare myself Wellsâ€”& Galsworthyâ€”) & live in an atmosphere very serene, bright, & fenced off: for all that they are more to the point than ordinary people; go to the heart of things directly. Moore toddled off & got quickly into a cab, Jack said, for all his look of an old silver coin.
