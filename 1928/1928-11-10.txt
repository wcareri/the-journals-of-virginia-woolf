### Saturday 10 November

This unexampled fluency here is due to the fact that I should be reading Miss Jewsbury, answering letters (Lady Cunard to dine alone with George Moore) or correcting Hardy & Gissing. All these tasks are unworthy the sacred morning hours. Phrase tossing can only be done then; so I toss them privately here, feeling relieved not to be making money, once in a while. Shall I say that Bennett in the Evâ ening Standard hurt me less than Squire in the Observer? Not at all, I think;â€”an odd thing, though, how I am praised & abused: & what a sting I am in the flanks of Squires & Bennetts.

What is more interestingâ€”& Lord knows this is trueâ€”I am speaking coolly & faithfullyâ€”is the trial yesterday at Bow Street. We were all packed in by 10.30: the door at the top of the court opened; in stepped the debonair distinguished magistrate; we all rose; he bowed; took his seat under the lion & the unicorn, & then proceeded. Something like a Harley St. specialist investigating a case. All black & white, tie pin, clean shaven, wax coloured, & carved, in that light, like ivory. He was ironical at first: raised his eyebrows & shrugged. Later I was impressed by the reason of the law, its astuteness, its formality. Here have we evolved a very remarkable fence between us & barbarity; something commonly recognised; half humbug & ceremony thereforeâ€”when they pulled out calf bound books & read old phrases I thought this; & the bowing & scraping made me think it; but in these banks runs a live stream. What is obscenity? What is literature? What is the difference between the subject & the treatment? In what cases is evidence allowable? This last, to my relief, was decided against us: we could not be called as experts in obscenity, only in art. So Desmond who had got under the palanquin where he looked too indifferent, too calm, too completely at his ease to be natural, was only asked his qualifications & then, not allowed to answer the obscene question, was dismissed. In the hall I talked to Lady Troubridge (who used to sculpt & last time we met was a tea party, as children, in Montpelier Sqre) & Johnâ€”John lemon yellow, tough, stringy, exacerbated. Their costs run into 4 figures she said. And Leonard thinks this heralds a subscription. After lunch we heard an hour more, & then the magistrate, increasingly deliberate & courteous, said he would read the book again & give judgment next Friday at two, on the pale tepid vapid book which lay damp & slab all about the court. And I lost my little Roman brooch, & that is the end of this great day, so far. A curious brown top lighted scene; very stuffy; policemen at the doors; matrons passing through. An atmosphere quite decent & formal, of adult people.
