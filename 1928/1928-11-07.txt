And this shall be written for my own pleasure,â€”

But that phrase inhibits me: for if one writes only for oneâ€™s own pleasure,â€”I dont know what it is that happens. I suppose the convention of writing is destroyed; therefore one does not write at all. I am rather headachy, & dimly obscured with sleeping draught. This is the aftermath (what does that mean?â€”Trench, whom I open idly apparently says nothing) of Orlando. Yes, yes, since I wrote here I have become two inches & a half higher in the public view. I think I may say that I am now among the well known writers. I had tea with Lady Cunardâ€”might have lunched or dined any day. I found her in a little cap telephoning. It was not her atmosphereâ€”this of solitary talk. She is too shrewd to expand, & needs society to make her rash & random which is her point. Ridiculous little parrokeet faced woman; but not quite sufficiently ridiculous. I kept wishing for superlatives: could not get the illusion to flap its wings. Flunkeys, yes; but a little drab & friendly. Marble floors, yes; but no glamour; no tune strumming, for me at least. And the two of us sitting there had almost to be conventional & flatâ€”reminds me of Sir Thomas Browneâ€”the greatest book of our timesâ€”said a little flatly by a woman of business, to me who donâ€™t believe in that kind of thing unless launched with champagne & garlands. Then in came Lord Donegall, a glib Irish youth, dark sallow slick, on the Press. Dont they treat you like a dog? I said. â€œNo, not at allâ€ he replied, astonished that a marquis could be treated like a dog by anyone. And then we went up & up to see pictures on stairs in ballrooms & finally to Lady C.â€™s bedroom, hung entirely with flower pieces. The bed has its triangular canopy of rose red silk; the windows, looking on the square, are hung with green brocade. Her poudreuseâ€”like mine only painted & gilt stood open with gold brushes looking glasses, & there on her gold slippers were neatly laid gold stockings. All this paraphernalia for one stringy old hop oâ€™ my thumb. She set the two great musical boxes playing & I said did she lie in bed & listen to them? But no. She has nothing fantastic in that way about her. Money is important. She told me rather sordid stories of Lady Sackville never visiting her without fobbing something off on herâ€”now a bust, worth Â£5, for which she paid Â£100; now a brass knocker. â€œAnd then her talk I didnâ€™t care for itâ€¦â€ Somehow I saw into these sordid commonplace talks, & could not sprinkle the air with gold dust easily. But no doubt she has her acuity, her sharp peck at life; only how adorable, I thought, as I tiptoed home in my tight shoes, in the fog, in the chill, could one open one of these doors that I still open so venturously, & find a live interesting real person, a Nessa, a Duncan, a Roger. Some one new, whose mind would begin vibrating. Coarse & usual & dull these Cunards & Colefaxes areâ€”for all their astonishing competence in the commerce of life.

And I cannot think what to â€˜write nextâ€™. I mean the situation is, this Orlando is of course a very quick brilliant book. Yes, but I did not try to explore. And must I always explore? Yes I think so still. Because my reaction is not the usual. Nor can I even after all these years run it off lightly. Orlando taught me how to write a direct sentence; taught me continuity & narrative, & how to keep the realities at bay. But I purposely avoided of course any other difficulty. I never got down to my depths & made shapes square up, as I did in The Lighthouse.

Well but Orlando was the outcome of a perfectly definite, indeed overmastering impulse. I want fun. I want fantasy. I want (& this was serious) to give things their caricature value. And still this mood hangs about me. I want to write a history, say of Newnham or the womans movement, in the same vein. The vein is deep in meâ€”at least sparkling, urgent. But is it not stimulated by applause? overstimulated? My notion is that there are offices to be discharged by talent for the relief of genius: meaning that one has the play side; the gift when it is mere gift, unapplied gift; & the gift when it is serious, going to business. And one relieves the other.

Yes, but The Moths? That was to be an abstract mystical eyeless book: a playpoem. And there may be affectation in being too mystical, too abstract; saying Nessa & Roger & Duncan & Ethel Sands admire that: it is the uncompromising side of me; therefore I had better win their approvalâ€”

Again, one reviewer says that I have come to a crisis in the matter of style: it is now so fluent & fluid that it runs through the mind like water.

That disease began in The Lighthouse. The first part came fluidâ€”how I wrote & wrote!

Shall I now check & consolidate, more in the Dalloway Jacobâ€™s Room style?

I rather think the upshot will be books that relieve other books: a variety of styles & subjects: for after all, that is my temperament, I think: to be very little persuaded of the truth of anythingâ€”what I say, what people sayâ€”always to follow, blindly instinctively with a sense of leaping over a precipiceâ€”the call ofâ€”the call ofâ€”now, if I write The Moths I must come to terms with these mystical feelings.

Desmond destroyed our Saturday walk; he is now mouldy & to me depressing. He is perfectly reasonable & charming. Nothing surprises, nothing shocks him. He has been through it all one feels. He has come out rolled, smoothed, rather sodden rather creased & jumbled, like a man who has sat up all night in a third class railway carriage. His fingers are stained yellow with cigarettes. One tooth in the lower jaw is missing. His hair is dank. His eye more than ever dubious. He has a hole in his blue sock. Yet he is resolute & determinedâ€”thats what I find so depressing. He seems to be sure that it is his view that is the right one; ours vagaries, deviations. And if his view is the right one, God knows there is nothing to live for: not a greasy biscuit. And the egotism of men surprises & shocks me even now. Is there a woman of my acquaintance who could sit in my arm chair from 3 to 6.30 without the semblance of a suspicion that I may be busy, or tired, or bored; & so sitting could talk, grumbling & grudging, of her difficulties, worries; then eat chocolates, then read a book, & go at last, apparently self-complacent & wrapped in a kind of blubber of misty self satisfaction? Not the girls at Newnham or Girton. They are far too spry; far too disciplined. None of that self-confidence is their lot.

We paid for our dinner at the Lion. Miss Thomas & Miss â€”â€”? were relieved, not to have to part with quite so many half crowns. And they showed us the chocolate coloured corridors of Girton, like convent cells;â€”

And there was the meeting in Mr Williams Ellises studioâ€”a vast hall in Ebury street, with ostentatiously ragged chair covers. Our raggedness, as a profession, was not ostentatious alas; it is part of our souls; a dowdiness that is not ragged, however; a meticulous respectability which is not my working state; for then I am, I think, almost picturesque. As a crowd together we achieve only dinginess & something egotistic & unreserved in our faces; as for old Garnett, I felt surely someone ought to put that surly shaggy unkempt old monstrosity (certainly his nails want cutting & his coat is matted with mud & burrs) in the lethal chamber. Dâ ittâ o of his mistress: the top half Esquimaux, the bottom Maytime in Hampsteadâ€”sprigged muslin, sandals. Vita as usual like a lamp or torch in all this petty bourgeoisdom; a tribute to the breeding of the Sackvilles, for without care of her clothes she appears among them (in all the sanity & strength of a well made body) like a lampost, straight, glowing. None of us have that; or know not how to carry it.

Poor Rose Macaulayâ€”a mere chit; a waferâ€”& so on to the Hendersons in Hampstead, where my spleen & Frankieâ€™s were twin spleens: poor Frankie however kept his rattle & clapper going, hour after hour, sounding alone, while I sank in a tolerable arm chair & could say nothing; though Mrs Enfield who has read the whole of Balzac made advances with Proust. Faith, I think, saw in this languor, bad manners & conceit. She saw us despising her home & husband. She despised them herself. And she went to bed saying something bitter to Hubert, & looked back into the drawing room, wondering why all the colours were wrong. But then next morning there are the children at breakfast & she recovers somewhat but has to speak severely about Mrs Maypole, the hired help (10/- a night) who dropped the plates, & left Mr Birrell holding the ladle; & the ice was salt. Then she takes up Orlando & says, to Hubert, â€œThis is a greatly over rated bookâ€”It is far far worse than The Lighthouseâ€¦â€™ at the same time, â€˜What exciting lives these people lead! Bloomsburyâ€¦â€
