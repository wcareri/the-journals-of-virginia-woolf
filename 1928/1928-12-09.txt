### Sunday 9 December

These reflections are written on a bitter cold evening to get the taste of a sentence into my mouth again. Angelica came this morning, & every time I lifted my pen she,â€”heavenly little creature that she is, demure, witty fantastic, neatly tipped the cup upside down; like a fool I went on trying to write, & only gave up when I was in a state of exasperation, not with her, but with my book: I was beginning a new beginning to Fiction. Now it is after tea; Angus will be coming to see Leonard about a character; & I am escaped, & canâ€™t be got at; & shall read Troilus & Cressida (Chaucer) till dinner. I have again seen too many people, without much intensity. Lydiaâ€™s foolish tea party; & the Bagenalsâ€™ lunch, & Christa; & then Long Bam, & being driven up by Dotty; â€œI cant say I understand Haroldâ€”I canâ€™t really say I doâ€â€”Then Vita, making a sacrifice of her quiet evening, drove up to London & heard her broadcast & went back with her, to save me the solitary drive. This worried me, rather: for whom would I give up this evening? & then Dotty with her pecking exacting ways â€œPlease dear put the window upâ€”put the window downâ€ makes Vita seem to me pathetically gentle & kind. But none of this matters very much I agree, & Lord helping, I shall work all this weekâ€”save for the evenings. It is so cold my back is cold now, while the fire roasts my feet; fire is striking & many fire engines have rushed down Southampton Row. The King is dragging along, & the shop assistants are in fear lest they shall lose their Christmas bonus. Christmas impends. And we shall spend it alone here, I think, & go to Rodmell afterwards & plan a new room, with Kennedy. And then to Berlin we say. Meanwhile Nessa & I give our Tuesday evenings, & too many people press to come.

But why I ask â€œseeâ€ people? Whats the point? These isolated occasions which come so often. May I come & see you? And what they get, or I get, save the sense of a slide passing on a screen, I cant say.
