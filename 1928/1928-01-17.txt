### Tuesday 17 January

In half an hour or so Nessa & Duncan will look in on their way to Rogerâ€™s to say good bye. This is the true break in the year: Bloomsbury is dispersed today till May, I suppose. Clive was off to Germany this morning.

Yesterday we went to Hardyâ€™s funeral. What did I think of? Of Max Beerbohmâ€™s letter, just read; or a lecture to the Newnhamites about womenâ€™s writing. At intervals some emotion broke in. But I doubt the capacity of the human animal for being dignified in ceremony. One catches a Bishops frown & twitch: sees his polished shiny nose; suspects the rapt spectacled young priest gazing at the cross he carries, of being a humbug; catches Robert Lyndâ€™s distracted haggard eye; then thinks of the mediocrity of Squire; next here is the coffin, an overgrown one; like a stage coffin, covered with a white satin cloth: bearers elderly gentlemen rather red & stiff, holding to the corners: pigeons flying outside; insufficient artificial light; procession to poets corner; dramatic â€œIn sure & certain hope of immortalityâ€ perhaps melodramatic. After dinner at Cliveâ€™s Lytton protested that the great manâ€™s novels are the poorest of poor stuff; & canâ€™t read them. Lytton sitting or lying inert, with his eyes shut, or exasperated with them open. Lady Strachey slowly fading, but it may take years. Over all this broods for me, some uneasy sense, of change, & mortality, & how partings are deaths; & then a sense of my own fameâ€”why should this come over me?â€”& then of its remoteness; & then the pressure of writing two articles on Meredith & furbishing up the Hardy. And Leonard sitting at home reading. And Maxâ€™s letter. & a sense of the futility of it all.
