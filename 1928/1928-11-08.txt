### Thursday 8 November

Just to solace myself before correcting Hardy & Gissing, I will note that we went to Karinâ€™s party last night. The truth is the stimulus is too brisk; one rattles; & only a shout can be heard, & one must stand; & one gets caught, like a bramble on a river by some branch; & hooked up out of the eddy. An emerald green Russian talked to me of seals & then gave me a card; I am to lecture 4 times a week for 8 weeks in Americaâ€”Oh yesâ€”& she will arrange most advantageous terms. But wonâ€™t mention money in a drawing room: so we lapse upon seals again, or Annâ€™s rabbitâ€”a chinchilla animal lying languidly extended in the midst of the rumpus, exquisite, alien. Ethel Sands, fanning my vanity into a glow: yet she was downright the other night that Orlando isnâ€™t a patch on Lighthouse, with talk of luncheon parties where nothing is talked about but &c. &c.

Janet & Angus to dinner. The young man who wants a job is not amiable; poor old Angus cuts up a little rough, & launches into anxious worried explanations about his play. He will never now break through that chrysalis core of gentlemanly reserve, caution, good manners which shells him in. I think he will meditate more & more upon the glories of being a Davidson. Yet he has his scallywag side, the poor man, dancing & dining, which is to his credit. Janet in comparison seemed rapid, decided & lustrous, all in gold for Karinâ€™s party with Madgeâ€™s gold necklace, & something very like Madge now & then; but tempered with the Vaughan decision. She is an attractive woman; competent; disinterested, taking blood tests all day to solve some abstract problem.
