### Saturday 11 February

I am so cold I can hardly hold the pen. The futility of it allâ€”so I broke off; & have indeed been feeling that rather persistently, or perhaps I should have written here. Hardy & Meredith together sent me torpid to bed with headache. I know the feeling now, when I canâ€™t spin a sentence, & sit mumbling & turning; & nothing flits by my brain which is as a blank window. So I shut my studio door, & go to bed, stuffing my ears with rubber; & there I lie a day or two. And what leagues I travel in the time! Such â€˜sensationsâ€™ spread over my spine & head directly I give them the chance; such an exaggerated tiredness; such anguishes & despairs; & heavenly relief & rest; & then misery again. Never was anyone so tossed up & down by the body as I am, I think. But it is over: & put away; & Lord Sackville is dead & lies at Withyam, & I passed Knole with Vita yesterday & had to look away from the vast masterless house, without a This is what she minds most. When she left the house behind the old cart horses, she went for ever, she said, after complete rule for three days.

For some reason, I am hacking rather listlessly at the last chapter of Orlando, which was to have been the best. Always always the last chapter slips out of my hands. One gets bored. One whips oneself up. I still hope for a fresh wind, & dont very much bother, except that I miss the fun, which was so tremendously lively all October, November & December. I have my doubts if it is not empty; & too fantastic to write at such length.

For the rest, Bloomsbury today revives. Clive is back: whereupon Mary asks us to lunch: & so we return to some flicker of the snowdrop pallor of very early spring.

My pen protests. This writing is nonsense, it says. And L. is with Mâ argaret Llâ ewelyn Dâ avies Pinker has the lice.
