### Saturday 21 April

A bitter windy rainy day. There is no blue, no red, no green in this detestable spring. Furs are in the shops. I have walked across the Park with Leonard; come home; find the char in the studio; must write here instead of making, as I had meant, some carefully polished sentencesâ€”for Orlando is to tell the truth, damned rough.

Life is either too empty or too full. Happily, I never cease to transmit these curious damaging shocks. At 46 I am not callous; suffer considerably; make good resolutionsâ€”still feel as experimental & on the verge of getting at the truth as ever. Oh & Vitaâ€”to change the subject & take up the burden of factsâ€”has had a stupendous row with her motherâ€”in the course of which she was made to take the pearl necklace from her neck, cut it in two with a pocket knife, deliver over the 12 central pearls, put the relics, all running loose, in an envelope the solicitor gave her. Thief, liar, I hope youâ€™ll be killed by an omnibusâ€”so â€˜my honoured Lady Sackvilleâ€™ adressed her, trembling with rage in the presence of a secretary & a solicitor & a Chauffeur. The woman is said to be mad. Vita very gallant & wild & tossing her head & taking me to the Zoo & saying she was wild & free & wd. make her money now herself by writing.

And I find myself again in the old driving whirlwind of writing against time. Have I ever written with it? But I vow I wont spend longer at Orlando, which is a freak; it shall come out in September, though the perfect artist would revoke & rewrite & polishâ€”infinitely. But hours remain over to be filled with reading something or otherâ€”Iâ€™m not sure what. What sort of summer do I desire? Now that I have 16 pounds to spend before July 1st (on our new system) I feel freer: can afford a dress or a hat, & so may go about, a little, if I want. And yet the only exciting life is the imaginary one. Once I get the wheels spinning in my head, I dont want money much, or dress, or even a cupboard, a bed at Rodmell or a sofa.

Dined with Lydia & Maynard: two couples, elderly, childless distinguished. He & she both urbane & admirable. Grey comes at Maynardâ€™s temples. He is finer looking now: not with us pompous or great: simple, with his mind working always, on Russian, Bolshevists, glands, genealogies; always the proof of a remarkable mind when it overflows thus vigorously into byepaths. There are two royal stocks in England he says from which all intellect descends. He will work this out as if his fortune depended on it. Lydia is composed, & controlled. She says very sensible things.

We went, also, to Janeâ€™s funeral, getting â€˜thereâ€™ (somewhere out of the world where buses pass only one every 15 minutes), just as the service ended; marching into the church clamorously; but it was only barely full of the dingiest people; cousins I fancy from the North, very drab: the only male relation afflicted, with a bubbly chin, a stubbly beard, & goggly eyes. Distinguished people drag up such queer chains of family when they die. They had hired Daimlers too, which succeeded the coffin at a foots pace. We walked to the grave; the clergyman, a friend, waited for the dismal company to collect; then read some of the lovelier, more rational parts of the Bible; & said, by heart, Abide with me. The gravedigger had given him, surreptitiously, a handful of clay, which he divided into three parts & dropped at the right moments. A bird sang most opportunely; with a gay indifference, & if one liked, hope, that Jane would have enjoyed. Then the incredibly drab female cousins advanced, each with a fat bunch of primroses & dropped them in; & we also advanced & looked down at the coffin at the bottom of a very steep brazen looking graveâ€”But thoâ€™ L. almost cried, I felt very littleâ€”only the beauty of the Come unto me all ye that are weary; but as usual the obstacle of not believing dulled & bothered me. Who is â€˜Godâ€™ & what the Grace of Christ? & what did they mean to Jane?

Raymond to teaâ€”two hours animated admirable light & airy & well seasoned talk, about facts mostly: ghosts; consciousness; novels: not people much. But he has his shirts made of figured tablecloths, shiny, hard.

And what am I to read? Pinker is back. And Leonard having tea with his mother. And perhaps the old woman has sighed herself through my room, & I can go down & do that typing, & write to the little man who smacks me in public & appeals for my pityâ€”Clive I mean.
