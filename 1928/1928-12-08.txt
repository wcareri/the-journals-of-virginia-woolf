### Saturday 8 December

Here is a note barely dashed off (10 to oneâ€”just finished, very provisionally â€œPhases of Fictionâ€) after Christabel MacClaren; & her â€˜winkleâ€™ party, as I call it, the other night. I mean she picked me out with a pinâ€”about Lesbianism, & Dottyâ€”(she is not one). My note was about her attitude to men; the adoring, flattering womanâ€™s attitude, which I so seldom see so purely. Like a flame leaping up. Clive â€œthe most honourable of menâ€â€”yes but said with a devoutness, a radiancy, that made me laugh. Is this the â€˜naturalâ€™ attitude between the sexes? What Clive has, the other way round for women? So cordial, so appreciative; I could hear it kindling her voice when she said â€œThe men were bathing or writing letters or talking that was at Sherfield. The men, good delightful creatures, were so engaged while that wretched furtive creature D. pursued me. And I can see man after man, Desmond, Clive &c, Wells, Shaw, warming his hands at this natural warmth, & expanding. It amused me. The other thought I had was about the limits of luxury: how far can the human soul stretch into rugs & rooms; at what point they suffocate its force. I have seen several rich people this autumn; & thought them, perhaps, dulled, coarsened by it: Lady Cunard; two days ago Mrs Bowen & Mrs Grenfell at Lydiaâ€™s.
