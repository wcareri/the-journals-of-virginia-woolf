No I cannot read Proust at the momentâ€”

Leonard is reading Orlando, which goes to the printer tomorrow. It is very quiet at the moment. Whitsun is over. We were at Rodmell & saw the races, where the marsh used to be. And our field is sold to Allinsonâ€”who is going to build. And what then? I have no brain left over to think with. And Leonard is arguing in the basement with Dadie. What can it be about? Pinker is asleep in the chair. Angelica comes back tomorrow. I feel a kind of drought caused by the lack of Nessa, & ask how shall I manage if we are apart 6 months, not only 4? But my creed is to batter down opposition. I have seenâ€”

I daresay a good many people, Rose Macaulay, Rebecca West, Maurois flash to mind in a bunch last week, & Toddâ€™s room; rather to her credit, workmanlike; Garland pearâ lâ hung & silken; Todd as buxom as a badger. Rebecca a hardened old reprobate I daresay, but no fool; & the whole atmosphere professional; no charm, except the rather excessive charm of Garland.

Cliveâ€™s book outâ€”a very superficial one, L. says.

The sun is out again; I have half forgotten Orlando already, since L. has read it & it has half passed out of my possession. I think it lacks the sort of hammering I should have given it if I had taken longer: is too freakish & unequal. Very brilliant now & then. As for the effect of the whole, that I cant judge. Not, I think â€˜importantâ€™ among my works. L. says a satire.

Gosse is dead, & I am half reconciled to him by theyâ€™re saying in the papers that he chose to risk a dangerous operation rather than be an invalid for life. This kind of vitality always gets me. Butâ€”lies otherwise flourish round his grave, & poor dear Desmond with 3 children to keep has to be as profuse of them as anybody.

We met him yesterday in Kingsway, just as I was thinking how I should describe him if I wrote a Memoir, as Molly insists. He loomed up as if my thought had made him visible. He gave me the first number of his paper.

Rose Macaulay says â€œYes I won the prizeâ€â€”rather peevishly. I think at once that she is jealous, & test whatever else she says with a view to finding out whether she is or not. About Colefax: â€œIâ€™m the only one of all my friends who isnâ€™t asked there.â€ About work: â€˜Iâ€™ve got to work tomorrowâ€™ I say, excusing myself for not going to Raymondâ€™s party. â€œSo have we allâ€ rather sharply. & so on. This shows through a dozen little phrases, as weâ€™re talking of America, articles &c: she is jealous of me; anxious to compare us: but I may imagine it: & it shows my own jealousy no doubt, as suspicions always do. One cdnâ€™t know them if one hadnâ€™t got them. And now to Angelica with a packet of bulls eyes. I am again beginning to read.

L. takes Orlando more seriously than I had expected. Thinks it in some ways better than The Lighthouse; about more interesting things, & with more attachment to life, & larger. The truth is I expect I began it as a joke, & went on with it seriously. Hence it lacks some unity. He says it is very original. Anyhow Iâ€™m glad to be quit this time of writing â€˜a novelâ€™; & hope never to be accused of it again. Now I want to write some very closely reasoned criticism; book on fiction; an essay of some sort (but not Tolstoy for the Times). Dr Burneyâ€™s evening party I think for Desmond. And then? I feel anxious to keep the hatch down: not to let too many projects come in. Something abstract poetic next timeâ€”I dont know. I rather like the idea of these Biographies of living people. Ottoline suggests herselfâ€”but no. And I must tear up all that manuscript, & write a great many notes & adventure out into the worldâ€”as I shall do tomorrow, when I go to have my ears pierced with Vita.

June weather. Still, bright, fresh. Owing to the Lighthouse (car) I dont feel so shut in London as usual, & can imagine the evening on some moor now, or in France without the envy I used to have, in London on a fine evening. Also London itself perpetually attracts, stimulates, gives me a play & a story & a poem, without any trouble, save that of moving my legs through the streets. I walked Pinker to Grays Inn Gardens this afternoon, & sawâ€”Red Lion Square: Morrisâ€™es house; thought of them on winters evenings in the joties; thought we are just as interesting; saw the (street) Great Ormond St where a dead girl was found yesterday; saw & heard the Salvation Army making Xtianity gay for the people: a great deal of nudging & joking on the part of very unattractive young men & women; making it lively, I suppose; & yet, to be truthful, when I watch them I never laugh or criticise, but only feel how strange & interesting this is: wonder what they mean by â€˜Come to the Lord.â€™ I daresay exhibitionism accounts for some of it: the applause of the gallery; this lures boys to sing hymns; & kindles shop boys to announce in a loud voice that they are saved. It is what writing for the Evening Standard is for Rose Macaulay & I was going to say myself: but so far I have not done it.
