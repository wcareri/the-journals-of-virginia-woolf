### Saturday 22 September

This is written on the verge of my alarming holiday in Burgundy. I am alarmed of 7 days alone with Vita: interested; excited, but afraidâ€”she may find me out, I her out. I may (& theres Mabel the Bride in her white dress at the pump. The bridegroom, a carter out of work, wears white socks. Are they pure? I doubt it. They are going to spend their honeymoon near Pevensey. He was 15 minutes late & we saw her come in wearing a wreath. And I felt this is the heart of Englandâ€”this wedding in the country: history I felt; Cromwell; The Osbornes; Dorothyâ€™s shepherdesses singing, of all of whom Mr & Mrs Jarrad seem more the descendants than I am. as if they represented the unconscious breathing of England & L. & I, leaning over the wall, were detached, unconnected. I suppose our thinking is the cause of this. We dont belong to any â€˜classâ€™; we thinkers: might as well be French or German. Yet I am English in some wayâ€”)

But I was saying I should on the whole be confident about this French journeyâ€”that it will turn out well. Iâ€™m afraid of the morning most; & 3 oâ€™clock in the afternoon; & wanting something Vita does not want. And I shall spend the money that might have bought a table or a glass. What one buys in foreign travel is a series of scenes; which gradually diminish to one or two, such as I still have of Greece & Venice as I saw them when I was 24 or 5. And I shall love the freedom from hours; & looking about; & the thought of coming back; & sitting talking, & some things I shall read; & one or two views, &â€”

This has been the finest, & not only finest, but loveliest, summer in the world. Still, though it blows, how clear & bright it is; & the clouds are opalescent; the long barns on my horizon mouse coloured; the stacks pale gold. Owning the field has given a different orient to my feelings about Rodmell. I begin to dig myself in & take part in it. And I shall build another storey to the house if I make money. But the news of Orlando is black. We may sell a third that we sold of The Lighthouse before publicationâ€”Not a shop will buy save in 6es & 12es. They say this is inevitable. No one wants biography. But it is a novel, says Miss Ritchie. But it is called a biography on the title page, they say. It will have to go to the Biography shelf. I doubt therefore that we shall do more than cover expensesâ€”a high price to pay for the fun of calling it a biography. And I was so sure it was going to be the one popular book! Also it should be 10/6 or 12/6 not 9/- Lord, lord! Thus I must write some articles this winter, if we are to have nest eggs at the Bank. Down here I have flung myself tooth & mil on my fiction book, & should have finished the first draft but for Dorothy Osborne whom Iâ€™m dashing off. It will need entire re-writing but the grind is doneâ€”the rushing through book after book & now what shall I read? These novels have hung about me so long. Mercy it is to be quit of them; & shall I read English poetry, French memoirsâ€”shall I read now for a book to be called â€œThe Lives of the Obscureâ€? And when, I wonder, shall I begin the Moths? Not until I am pressed into it by those insects themselves. Nor have I any notion what it is to be likeâ€”a completely new attempt I think. So I always think.

A very gay active summer. Dined with the Keynesâ€™ to meet Lord Gage last Wednesdayâ€”found him with his flat face & Circassian blood, more of a character than I expected. Clive with inverse snobbery had run him down. We talked about the King, & he snubbed me by saying that he remarked an odd factâ€”everyone talks to him about the King. Every class, every kind of person, is interested to know what the King has for dinner. And here was I, the intellectual, the labour woman, doing just the same thing. And there were the Russell Cookes; her I liked; him I hated. A woman is in some ways so much better than a manâ€”more natural, juicy, unfettered. But then he is a bounder, a climber, a shoving young man, who wants to be smart, cultivated, go-ahead & all the rest of it. I must use that clichÃ© because I must do my Osborne article. & it is getting cold out here.
