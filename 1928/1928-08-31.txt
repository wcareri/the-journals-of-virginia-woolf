### Friday 31 August

This is the last day of August, & like almost all of them of extraordinary beauty. Each day is fine enough & hot enough for sitting out; but also full of wandering clouds; & that fading & rising of the light which so enraptures me in the downs: which I am always comparing to the light beneath an alabaster bowl, &c. The corn is now stood about in rows of three for our four or five solid shaped yellow cakesâ€”rich, it seems, with eggs & spice: good to eat. Sometimes I see the cattle galloping â€˜like madâ€™ as Dostoevsky would say, in the brooks. The cloudsâ€”if I could describe them I would: one yesterday had flowing hair on it like the very fine white hair of an old man. At this moment they are white in a leaden sky; but the sun, behind the house, is making the grass green. I walked to the racecourse today & saw a weasel.

Morgan was here for the week end; timid, touchy, infinitely charming. One night we got drunk, & talked of sodomy, & sapphism, with emotionâ€”so much so that next day he said he had been drunk. This was started by Radclyffe Hall & her meritorious dull book. They wrote articles for Hubert all day, & got up petitions; & then Morgan saw her & she screamed like a herring gull, mad with egotism & vanity. Unless they say her book is good, she wont let them complain of the laws. Morgan said that Dr Head can convert the sodomites. â€œWould you like to be converted?â€ Leonard asked. â€œNoâ€ said Morgan, quite definitely. He said he thought Sapphism disgusting: partly from convention, partly because he disliked that women should be independent of men.

Probably the reason why I shall be so much bored this week end by Mrs Woolf is that we shall not be able to say a word we mean. It is like talking to a child; a child, too, with â€˜feelingsâ€™: a child with â€œrightsâ€ & a sense of propriety & respectability & what ought to be said & done. Having made up all these principles she is, & they all are, secretly dissatisfied; because they, naturally, get no pleasure from life; are cased in thick wool from any direct contact; & so these peopleâ€”an immense classâ€”are always uneasy unless they are eating, being flattered, or doing some natural task, like nursing a child. And then, if the child is Leonard, he grows up & is horribly bored by you.

I must now begin Peacock, without attempting to describe the extraordinary primeval appearance of the farm wagons; so laden with the hay in the brooks that they look like some vast shaggy animal moving on very short legs.

We have seen Mr James about the field; & will soon, I hope, sign the agreement, or cheque; & put up a fence, which is my first act as a landowner to keep the cottage children out. Nessa, being a mother, & thus not sentimental about children, says â€œThey can easily play somewhere else.â€
