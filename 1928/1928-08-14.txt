### Tuesday 14 August

Just back from Long Barn & Dottieâ€™s new house, Penn in the Rocks. Can one really be in love with a house? Is there not something sterile, so that oneâ€™s mind becomes stringy in these passions? She is too anxious for other people to praise it. And I donâ€™t want possessions. I think this is true. I dont want to be Dottie collecting endless settees & arm chairs round myself. But then I have now a pressing sense of the flight of time; & if one is so soon to arrive, why pack all these things? More truthfully, if one is so soon to start, why prepare all these impedimenta. I feel on the verge of the world, about to take flight. Dottie on the other hand feels â€œI have at least, in spite of every other grudge on the part of fate, 10 or 15 thousand a year; & it is only fair that I should get from my money what I can.â€ Somehow angrily then she sets to work to make her money slave for her. She has bought for ever & ever all these couchant rocks; rocks like kneeling elephants; agonised writhing rocks elongated rocks, rocks with grotesque roots grown into them, & Japanese trees on top. She runs about, defiant strident a little discordant in her top hoots with her dogs & says â€œIâ€™m so tiredâ€”so worn outâ€, gesticulates, exaggerates. I like the aristocratic tradition of space & a few good things. The house itself is now in sections. Half a ceiling (overhangs) intersects what were & will be dining room & bedroom above. This gives the house a provisional air; it is not a house that has been there 300 years, & housed Penn & other families; it is nothingâ€”which in a house is distressing.

After that country, though, how I adore the emptiness, bareness, air & colour of this! Really. I would not give this view for Dottieâ€™s rocks. A relic I think of my fathers feeling for the Alpsâ€”this ecstasy of mine over the bare slope of Asheham hill. But then, as I remind myself, half the beauty of a country or a house comes from knowing it. One remembers old lovelinesses: knows that it is now looking ugly; waits to see it light up; knows where to find its beauty; how to ignore the bad things. This one canâ€™t do the first time of seeing. But they build with beautiful blocks of grey stone in Kent. D.â€™s farmhouse was the very house for me, solid, high, with the shape of the stone showing in the wall. This is all thrown in with her rocks. And she ecstasissâ es over them, fancying them sympathetic to her genius, & makes them into part of her belief in her own genius.

Monks House looked very nice, unexpectedly so, & the great lily in the window has now four flowers. They opened in the night. So I was appeased aesthetically for my disappointment in having no lettersâ€”not one. I was going to remark however that Dottieâ€™s rocks are powdered pale greys & bright greens; they are grey as elephant backs. There are, too, bunches of scarlet berries hanging against them: only all too verdant, mossy, steamy, & enclosed for my taste. However, in the train it struck me that it is, even from oneâ€™s own point of view, a great advantage that other people should like trees & so on; Whyâ€”I cant at the moment remember.
