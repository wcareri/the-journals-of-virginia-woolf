### Saturday 7 July

& a Saturday morning, very hot & fine.

All last night I dreamt of Katherine Mansfield & wonder what dreams are; often evoke so much more emotion, than thinking doesâ€”almost as if she came back in person & was outside one, actively making one feel; instead of a figment called up & recollected, as she is, now, if I think of her. Yet some emotion lingers on the day after a dream; even though Iâ€™ve now almost forgotten what happened in the dream, except that she was lying on a sofa in a room high up, & a great many sad faced women were round her. Yet somehow I got the feel of her, & of her as if alive again, more than by day.

At Long Barn yesterday, a good rather happy visit. Iâ€™m interested by the gnawing down of strata in friendship; how one passes unconsciously to different terms; takes things easier; dont mind at all hardly about dress or anything; scarcely feel it an exciting atmosphere, which, too, has its drawback from the â€œfizzingâ€ point of view: yet is saner, perhaps deeper. Lay by the black currant bushes lecturing Vita on her floundering habits with the Campbells for instance. Mrs C. beat by her husband, all because V. will come triumphing, with her silver & her coronets & her footmen into the life of a herring-cooker. She cooks herrings on a gas stove, I said, always remembering my own phrases.

But having thus scrambled in a page, I must goâ€”& yet want to stay & write about Sterne.
