### Tuesday 17 April

Home again, as foretold, last night, & to settle the dust in my mind, write here. We have been across France & backâ€”every inch of that fertile field traversed by the admirable Singer. And now towns & spires & scenes begin to rise in my mind as the rest sinks. I see Chartres in particular, the snail, with its head straight, marching across the flat country, the most distinguished of churches. The rose window is like a jewel on black velvet. The outside is very intricate yet simple; elongated; somehow preserved from the fantastic & ornate. Grey weather dashed all over this; & I remember coming in at night in the wet often, & hearing the rain in hotels. Often I was bobbing up & down on my two glasses of vin du pays.

It was rather a rush & a cramâ€”as these jumbled notes testify. Once we were high up on a mountain in a snow storm; & rather afraid of a long tunnel. Twenty miles often cut us off from civilisation. One wet afternoon we punctured in a mountain village & I went in & sat with the family a nice scrupulous polite woman, a girl who was pretty, shy, had a friend called Daisy at Earlsfield. They caught trout & wild boars. Then on we went to Florae, where I found a bookâ€”Girardinâ€™s memoirs in the old bookcase that had been sold with the house. Always some good food & hot bottles at night. And there was Nessa & Duncan & Clive (who smacked me in publicâ€”curse him for an uneasy little upstart.) Oh & my prizeâ€”Â£40 from the French. And Julian. And one or two hot days & the Pont du Garde in the sun; & Les Beaux (this is where Dante got his idea of Hell Duncan said) & mounting all the time steadily was my desire for words, till I envisaged a sheet of paper & pen & ink as something of miraculous desirabilityâ€”could even relish the scratch as if it were a divine kind of relief to meâ€”And there was St Remy & the ruins in the sun. I forget now how it all wentâ€”how thing fitted to thing; but the eminences now emerge, & I noticed how, talking to Raymond at The Nation this afternoon we had already pitched on the high points. Before that, crossing the graveyard in the bitter windy rain, we saw Hope & a dark cultivated woman. But on they went past us, with the waver of an eye. Next moment I heard Virginia, & turned & there was Hope coming backâ€”â€œJane died yesterdayâ€ she murmured, half asleep, talking distraught, â€˜out of herself.â€™ We kissed by Cromwellâ€™s daughterâ€™s grave, where Shelley used to walk, for Janeâ€™s death. She lay dead outside the graveyard in that back room where we saw her lately raised on her pillows, like a very old person, whom life has tossed up, & left; exalted, satisfied, exhausted. Hope the colour of dirty brown paper. Then to the office, then home to work here; & now to work & work, as hard as I can.
