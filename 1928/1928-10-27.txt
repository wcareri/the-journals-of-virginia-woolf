### Saturday 27 October

A scandal, a scandal, to let so much time slip, & I leaning on the Bridge watching it go. Only leaning has not been my pose: running up & down, irritably, excitedly restlessly. And the stream viciously eddying. Why do I write these metaphors? Because I have written nothing for an age.

Orlando has been published. I went to Burgundy with Vita. We did not find each other out. It flashed by. Yet I was glad to see Leonard again. How disconnected this is! My ambition is from this very moment, 8 minutes to six, on Saturday evening, to attain complete concentration again. When I have written here, I am going to open Fanny Burneyâ€™s diaries, & work solidly at that article which poor Miss McKay cables about. I am going to read; to think. I gave up reading & thinking on the 24th of Sept when I went to France. I came back, & we plunged into London & publishing. I am a little sick of Orlando. I think I am a little indifferent now what anyone thinks. Joyâ€™s lifeâ€™s in the doingâ€”I murder, as usual, a quotation: I mean its the writing, not the being read that excites me. And as I canâ€™t write while Iâ€™m being read, I am always a little hollow hearted; whipped up; but not so happy as in solitude. The reception, as they say, surpassed expectations. Sales beyond our record for the first week. I was floating rather lazily on praise, when Squire barked in the Observer, but even as I sat reading him on the backs last Sunday in the showering red leaves & their illumination, I felt the rock of self esteem untouched in me. â€œThis doesnâ€™t really hurtâ€ I said to myself; even now; & sure enough, before evening I was calm, untouched. And now theres Hugh in the Morning Post to spread the butter again, & Rebecca Westâ€”such a trumpet call of praiseâ€”thats her wayâ€”that I feel a little sheepish & silly. And now no more of that I hope.

Thank God, my long toil at the womenâ€™s lecture is this moment ended. I am back from speaking at Girton, in floods of rain. Starved but valiant young womenâ€”thatâ€™s my impression. Intelligent eager, poor; & destined to become schoolmistresses in shoals. I blandly told them to drink wine & have a room of their own. Why should all the splendour, all the luxury of life be lavished on the Julians & the Francises, & none on the Phares & the Thomases? Thereâ€™s Julian not much relishing it, perhaps. I fancy sometimes the world changes. I think I see reason spreading. But I should have liked a closer & thicker knowledge of life. I should have liked to deal with real things sometimes. I get such a sense of tingling & vitality from an evenings talk like that; oneâ€™s angularities & obscurities are smoothed & lit. How little one counts, I think: how little anyone counts; how fast & furious & masterly life is; & how all these thousands are swimming for dear life. I felt elderly & mature. And nobody respected me. They were very eager, egotistical, or rather not much impressed by age & repute. Very little reverence or that sort of thing about. The corridors of Girton are like vaults in some horrid high church cathedralâ€”on & on they go, cold & shinyâ€”with a light burning. High gothic rooms; acres of bright brown wood; here & there a photograph.

And we saw Trinity & Kingâ€™s this morning. Now to concentrate on English literatureâ€”forgetting Mary & Tom & how we went to be read aloud to, & Lady Cunard, & Clive back & Nessa back, & the Well of Loneliness. But Thank God to get back to writing again.
