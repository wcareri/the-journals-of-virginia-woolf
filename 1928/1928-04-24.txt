Waiting for Gumbo â€”how I hate waiting for anybody! Canâ€™t settle, read, thinkâ€”so I write: an odd tribute to the uses I put this diary to. And I should be typing O. in the basement. Must now do 10 pages daily till June 1st. Well, I like being an ass on a mill round.

In from the triumph of buying a dress & a coat for about 5.10. What one must do is to face the girl with oneâ€™s naked kindly searching eye: speak firmly; ask for a looking glass & study effects. Then they quail, under powder & paint. A lovely soaring summer day this: winter sent howling home to his arctic. I was reading Othello last night, & was impressed by the volley & volume & tumble of his words: too many I should say, were I reviewing for the Times. He put them in when tension was slack. In the great scenes, everything fits like a glove. The mind tumbles & splashes among words when it is not being urged on: I mean, the mind of a very great master of words who is writing with one hand. He abounds. The lesser writers stint. As usual, impressed by Shre. But my mind is very bare to wordsâ€”English wordsâ€”at the moment: they hit me, hard, I watch them bounce & spring. Iâ€™ve read only French for 4 weeks. An idea comes to me for an article on French; what we know of it.
