### Monday 10 September

This is written, as â€˜thisâ€™ is so often written, to fill up a little jagged piece of time, with Kennedy, the soft duckling boy, with a bill that opens wide & says â€˜Quackâ€™ in the drawing room, & Leonard talking to Mr James about the field. Desmond, who lunched here with Julian has just gone. We spent the afternoonâ€”hour after hour wasting away again, or why not say for once turning to gold & silverâ€”for I should only have been reading Moby Dick otherwiseâ€”coining gold & silver talk thenâ€”talk very intimate now, more so than ever: a continuation of our talk in Tavistock Sqre the other day: there he said he had now 12 years to live; nine to be exact: & here we talked of his work, money, women, children, & writing; till I took him along the Roman road; & back to tea. I was amused to find that when Rebecca West says â€œmen are snobsâ€ she gets an instant rise out of Desmond; so I retorted on him with the condescending phrase used about women novelists â€˜limitations in Life & Letters. But there was no acrimony in this. We talked with fertility; never working a seam dry. Do you suppose then that we are now coming like the homing rooks back to the tops of our trees? & that all this cawing is the beginning of settling in for the night? I seem to notice in several of my friends some endearing & affecting cordiality: & a pleasure in intimacy; as if the sun were sinking. Often that image comes to me with some sense of my physical state being colder now, the sun just off one; the old disc of oneâ€™s being growing coolerâ€”but it is only just beginning: & one will turn cold & silver like the moon.

This has been a very animated summer: a summer lived almost too much in public. Often down here I have entered into a sanctuary; a nunnery; had a religious retreat; of great agony once; & always some terror: so afraid one is of loneliness: of seeing to the bottom of the vessel. That is one of the experiences I have had here in some Augusts; & got then to a consciousness of what I call â€˜realityâ€™: a thing I see before me; something abstract; but residing in the downs or sky; beside which nothing matters; in which I shall rest & continue to exist. Reality I call it. And I fancy sometimes this is the most necessary thing to me: that which I seek. But who knowsâ€”once one takes a pen & writes? How difficult not to go making â€˜realityâ€™ this & that, whereas it is one thing. Now perhaps this is my gift; this perhaps is what distinguishes me from other people; I think it may be rare to have so acute a sense of something like thatâ€”but again, who knows? I would like to express it too.

Pinker had 4 puppies the day (Friday) we went to the Bagenals & Dotty. Dotty was rust red, shabby, intense a little; she showed us the rocks. Leonard â€˜took againstâ€™ her, as nurses say; violently. We drove home very fast. I on the other hand took in favour of Barbaraâ€”& wished I had gone up alone with her on to the downs. Iâ€”perhaps Leonard interrupted here.
