### Wednesday 28 November

Fatherâ€™s birthday. He would have been 96, yes, today; & could have been 96, like other people one has known; but mercifully was not. His life would have entirely ended mine. What would have happened? No writing, no books;â€”inconceivable. I used to think of him & mother daily; but writing The Lighthouse, laid them in my mind. And now he comes back sometimes, but differently. (I believe this to be trueâ€”that I was obsessed by them both, unhealthily; & writing of them was a necessary act.) He comes back now more as a contemporary. I must read him some day. I wonder if I can feel again, I hear his voice, I know this by heart?

Last night was one of our eveningsâ€”apparently successful; Adrian, Hope, Christa, Clive, Raymond, Bunny, Lytton, Vita & Valery towards the end: & Elizabeth Ponsonby. People enjoyed it. Perhaps I didnt; perhaps I did. Half way through Lytton vanished (he lodges upstairs) brayed out of the room by Cliveâ€™s vociferation, L. thinks. Clive makes it all very strident, gaslit, band played. I marked a queer change in my feeling when Lytton went. At other times I have felt his silence disapproving; have moderated my folly under it, & tried to keep him from going. But now that man writes Elizabeth & Essex; I kept thinking: well, if he can palm that off on us after years of effortâ€”that lively superficial meretricious bookâ€”he can go or stay as he likes. I feel no bite in his disapproval. And though one of my vile vices is jealousy, of other writersâ€™ fame, though I am (& I think we all are) secretly pleased to find Lyttonâ€™s book a bad one, I also feel depressed. If I were to analyse, the truth is I think that the pleasure is mean, & therefore not deep or satisfying; one would, in the depths, have got real pleasure, though superficial pain, had E & E been a masterpiece. Oh yes, I shouldâ€”for I have a mind that feeds perfectly dispassionately & apart from my vanities & jealousies upon literature; & that would have taken a masterpiece to itself. Mixed last night with my feeling was some curious personal dissatisfaction: that Lytton whom I loved & love should write like that. It is a reflection on my own taste. It is so feeble, so shallow; & yet Lytton in himself is neither. So one next accuses the public; & then the Carringtons & the young men. And one furbishes up a cloistered secluded invalidish Lytton whipping the flanks of the language & putting it to this foaming gallop, when the poor beast is all spavins & sores. And Dadie & Pernel & Janie Bussy & Dorothy all declared with emotion that this book was his best!

So the days pass, & I ask myself sometimes whether one is not hypnotised, as a child by a silver globe, by life; & whether this is living. Its very quick, bright, exciting. But superficial perhaps. I should like to take the globe in my hands & feel it quietly, round, smooth, heavy. & so hold it, day after day. I will read Proust I think. I will go backwards & forwards.

As for my next book, I am going to hold myself from writing till I have it impending in me: grown heavy in my mind like a ripe pear; pendant, gravid, asking to be cut or it will fall. The Moths still haunts me, coming, as they always do, unbidden, between tea & dinner, while L. plays the gramophone. I shape a page or two; & make myself stop. Indeed I am up against some difficulties. Fame to begin with. Orlando has done very well. Now I could go on writing like thatâ€”the tug & suck are at me to do it. People say this was so spontaneous, so natural. And I would like to keep those qualities if I could without losing the others. But those qualities were largely the result of ignoring the others. They came of writing exteriorly; & if I dig, must I not lose them? And what is my own position towards the inner & the outer? I think a kind of ease & dash are good;â€”yes: I think even externality is good; some combination of them ought to be possible. The idea has come to me that what I want now to do is to saturate every atom. I mean to eliminate all waste, deadness, superfluity: to give the moment whole; whatever it includes. Say that the moment is a combination of thought; sensation; the voice of the sea. Waste, deadness, come from the inclusion of things that dont belong to the moment; this appalling narrative business of the realist: getting on from lunch to dinner: it is false, unreal, merely conventional. Why admit any thing to literature that is not poetryâ€”by which I mean saturated? Is that not my grudge against novelâ istsâ€”that they select nothing? The poets succeeding by simplifying: practically everything is left out. I want to put practically everything in; yet to saturate. That is what I want to do in The Moths. It must include nonsense, fact, sordidity: but made transparent. I think I must read Ibsen & Shakespeare & Racine. And I will write something about them; for that is the best spur, my mind being what it is; then I read with fury & exactness; otherwise I slip & skip: I am a lazy reader. But no: I am surprised & a little disquieted by the remorseless severity of my mind: that it never stops reading & writing; makes me write on Geraldine Jewsbury, on Hardy, on Womenâ€”is too professional, too little any longer a dreamy amateur.
