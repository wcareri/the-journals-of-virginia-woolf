### Wednesday 25 August

For the third time this summer, though no other summer, I went to London on Monday, paid 5/- for a plate of ham, & said good bye to Katherine. I had my euphemism at parting; about coming again before she goes; but it is useless to extend these farewell visits. They have something crowded & unnaturally calm too about them, & after all, visits canâ€™t do away with the fact that she goes for two years, is ill, & heaven knows when we shall meet again. These partings make one pinch oneself as if to make sure of feeling. Do I feel this as much as I ought? Am I heartless? Will she mind my going either? And then, after noting my own callousness, of a sudden comes the blankness of not having her to talk to. So on my side the feeling is genuine. A woman caring as I care for writing is rare enough I suppose to give me the queerest sense of echo coming back to me from her mind the second after Iâ€™ve spoken. Then, too, thereâ€™s something in what she says of our being the only women, at this moment (I must modestly limit this to in our circle) with gift enough to make talk of writing interesting. How much I dictate to other people! How often too Iâ€™m silent, judging it useless to speak. I said how my own character seemed to cut out a shape like a shadow in front of me. This she understood (I give it as an example of her understanding) & proved it by telling me that she thought this bad: one ought to merge into things. Her senses are amazingly acuteâ€”a long description she gave of hosing plantsâ€”putting the hose over the high trees, then over the shrubs, then over the mignonette. And Murry said slowly, â€œYouâ€™ve got it wrong, Katherine. Youth wasnâ€™t like that. At least Iâ€™m sure mine wasnâ€™t.â€ Murry playing tennis all day; an oddly detached couple. She wants to live in an Italian town & have tea with the doctor. It suddenly strikes me as I write that I should like to ask her what certainty she has of her workâ€™s merit.â€”But we propose to write to each otherâ€”She will send me her diary. Shall we? Will she? If I were left to myself I should; being the simpler, the more direct of the two. I canâ€™t follow people who donâ€™t do the obvious things in these ways. Iâ€™ve recanted about her book; I shall review it; but whether she really wanted me to, God knows. Strange how little we know our friends.

So I missed my train; & what I wanted most in the world was to catch it & travel back with L.

Nelly is now going to have her teeth seen to. No talk of her coming back yet. I am quite given up as a reviewerâ€”seriously by the Times I believeâ€”& forge ahead with Jacob, which I wager to finish by Xmas.
