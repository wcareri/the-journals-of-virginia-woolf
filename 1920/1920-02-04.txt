### Wednesday 4 February

I had rather catch Leonardâ€™s itch than Lottieâ€™sâ€”thatâ€™s my only contribution to lice psychology which still occupies our minds, & wastes our mornings; & poisons our quiet after tea. For according to Fergusson, they turn over in their lairs when warm. No improvement so farâ€”also, so far as I know, no infection. But imagination! By taking thought I can itch at any point on my hundreds of inches of skin. I do it now.

The mornings from 12 to 1 I spend reading the Voyage Out. Iâ€™ve not read it since July 1913. And if you ask me what I think I must reply that I donâ€™t knowâ€”such a harlequinade as it isâ€”such an assortment of patchesâ€”here simple & severeâ€”here frivolous & shallowâ€”here like Godâ€™s truthâ€”here strong & free flowing as I could wish. What to make of it, Heaven knows. The failures are ghastly enough to make my cheeks burnâ€”& then a turn of the sentence, a direct look ahead of me, makes them burn in a different way. On the whole I like the young womans mind considerably. How gallantly she takes her fencesâ€”& my world what a gift for pen & ink! I can do little to amend; & must go down to posterity the author of cheap witticisms, smart satires & even, I find, vulgarismsâ€”crudities ratherâ€”that will never cease to rankle in the grave. Yet I see how people prefer it to N. & D.â€”I dont say admire it more, but find it a more gallant & inspiriting spectacle.

To Madame Graveâ€™s this afternoonâ€”& found her in her great new house. Maman is getting very trying poor dear. You set her on the stool & she does nothing. Then she wants the stool againâ€”But youâ€™ve just been there & done nothing maman! Then she calls me cruelâ€”very trying. And when she sleeps her mouth hangs down, as though she were dead. Sheâ€™s getting senile. All this simply, tenderly even, as we wander about the house, looking at the furniture. I like her childishness, & her unquenchable desire to make me another dress which will really be done in a week when she cant finish whatâ€™s on hand.
