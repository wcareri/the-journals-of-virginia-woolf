### Saturday 24 January

But on the contraryâ€”I didnâ€™t creep cold to bed, & the party amused me as a spectacleâ€”I should more truly say astonished me as a pandemonium. Molly can be heard out in the Adelphi; then, as the hostess sets the key, some hundred people, opening their mouths, tried to overcome her, by dint of roaring. I got my station in a corner, between Clive & Norton, & enjoyed the sense of irresponsible amusement. Not a human festival at all. Everyone smiling. As they could scarcely express their pleasure in words this was a necessary device. Margot was thereâ€”oh well, unpleasantly disfigured, in a low dress. I tried to turn her periods into laughter. Humour might do more to dissolve her poetry than criticism. Then young Mr Evans confided to me that his admiration of N. & D. was personal â€˜to tell you the truth Iâ€™m going through the same thing myselfâ€™â€”poor little man! Yet I was pleased to think my psychology â€˜intenseâ€™ & â€˜modernâ€™ & illuminating the crannies of Mr Evanâ€™s personal existence.

Oh dear, though, this talk of novels is all turned sour & brackish by a visit to Mrs Clifford. She must have supplied herself with false teeth since I saw herâ€”20 years ago; & her hair frizzed out is surely browned by art; but she remains otherwise the sameâ€”large codfish eyes & the whole figure of the ninetiesâ€”black velvetâ€”morbidâ€”intense, jolly, vulgarâ€”a hack to her tips, with a dash of the stageâ€”â€˜dearâ€™ â€˜my dear boyâ€”Did you know Leonard, that I was only married for 3 years, & then my husband died & left me with 2 babies & not a pennyâ€”so I had to workâ€”oh yes, I worked, & sold the furniture often, but I never borrowed.â€™ However the pathetic is not her line. She talks it to fill up space; but if I could reproduce her talk of money, royalties, editions, & reviews, I should think myself a novelist; & the picture might serve me for a warning. I think one may assume it to be more a product of the 90ties than of our age. Again, having years ago made a success, sheâ€™s been pulling the wires to engineer another ever since, & has grown callous in the process. Her poor old lips pout for a pat of butter; but margarine will do. She keeps her private & very rancid supply on some of the little tables that those distressing rooms are lumbered with (a wooden black cat on the clock, & little carved animals under it): she has a review of herself in the Bookman & a portrait, & a paper of quotations about Miss Fingal. I assure you I can hardly write this downâ€”Moreover, I had a feeling that in these circles people do each other good turns; & when she proposed to make my fortune in America, Iâ€™m afraid a review in the Times was supposed to be the equivalent. Brave, I suppose, with vitality & pluckâ€”but oh the sight of the dirty quills, & the scored blotting paper & her hands & nails not very clean eitherâ€”& money, reviews, proofs, helping hands, slatingsâ€”what an atmosphere of rancid cabbage & old clothes stewing in their old water! We went away laden with two of the cheap flaring booksâ€”â€˜Are you going to take my mangy works! to tell the truth Iâ€™m in debtâ€”â€™ Yes, but was that why we were asked to tea? Not altogether, I suppose, but, partly; subconsciously. And now, you see, all colour is taken from my boasting; a 2nd edition of the Voyage Out needed; & another of Night & Day shortly; & Nisbet offers me Â£100 for a book. Oh dear there must be an end of this! Never write for publishers again anyhow.

Iâ€™ve no time or finger power left to describe Desmond in his office; my haul of biographies; luncheon at Gordon Sqre; sitting in the great chairs before Cliveâ€™s fire afterwards; the apparition of Adrian; affection of Mary, & comparative docility of Clive.

I had tea with Lilian the other evening; we kissed silently: for my errand was to while away an hour of suspense for her while she waits for the verdict on her eyes. She may be blind, I supposeâ€”oh dear; & nothing could be said about it. What courage can make one, at 50, look down the remaining years, with that calamity to darken them!
