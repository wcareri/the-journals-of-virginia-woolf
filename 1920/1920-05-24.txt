### Monday 24 May

A real Bank Holidayâ€”blazing weatherâ€”sound of buses unceasingâ€”crowds like queues in the streetsâ€”& we spent it properly going to Hurlingham to see polo, of which I must make this rapid note. You get the impression that the turf is india rubberâ€”so lightly do the horses springâ€”touching it & up againâ€”Captain Lockit galloping down with his stick like a Persian rider with a lance. A large white ball is then thrown in the midst. The horses twirl & dart, dance their paws, twist on their tails like cats; almost like long lean cats their scamper after the ball; only as they come past you hear a roar in the nostrils. But the bounce & agility of them all knotted together pawing the ball with their feet indescribable; passing in a second from full gallop to delicate dribbling trot as the ball is dribbled almost between their feet. This is the game of the officers of England. Each had 8 ponies, & one lasted in this frenzy of freshness only 7 minutes. Anyhow it was well worth seeing. A very large ground. The elect in a shelter; public squatting on grass, or on chairs. The horses become suddenly big when they gallop straight at you & their pace alarming. At a little distance the most graceful & controlled of movements.

Summer has set in two days ago. Yesterday for the first time we lunched out of doors. The Swedes came. Affable conversation. She a painter, a cool friendly Scandinavian, highly enlightened; but I suppose thereâ€™s some lack of temperament in the enlightened races.
