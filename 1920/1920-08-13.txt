### Tuesday 13 August

For the first time in memory, I sit down to this page instead of to the sterner one of duty & profit at some minutes after ten a.m. Damn these aristocrats! damn myself for being such a snobâ€”unable to settle to Jacobâ€™s Room because â€˜about middayâ€™ Nelly Cecil in her motor car will descend. â€˜Driving Bob to Newhavenâ€”may I take bread & cheese with you?â€™ A dull listless morning, too, a little close in the house, yet chilly perhaps under the acacia; & not a spark of colour glowing. My preparations for the aristocracyâ€”but I wrong myselfâ€”Molly Hamilton, or Molly MacCarthy or any other Mollyâ€”would cause as much stirâ€”consist in pinning a chair cover together & filling the vases with sweet peas & roses. I dont like these civic interruptions into rural life. I didnâ€™t like the Clutton Brocks at Charleston. London yesterday I hated. More truly it was not London but a certain yard of the line between Richmond & Mortlake where we stopped for an hour & a halfâ€”I, too, due at the dentists with the treat of a lounge through my favourite streets afterwards. I wanted to buy some bright piece of china for the mantelpiece. As it was I scoured the town in taxis, lavished florins, accumulated parcels, swallowed tea, encountered Kot, & then spent 20 minutes at Victoriaâ€”however, L. was there, & we could chatter. But as the train swung out into open country life seemed fresher, sweeter, saner. One day I must pay a tribute to the humanity of dentists. Better than journalism for the soul, I told L.â€”but then, Iâ€™ve a vendetta with Massingham, against whom my arrow was launched. Its true though: I get more & more disinclined for journalism. Iâ€™ve written only half a page of it since coming hereâ€”three weeks ago; have refused 3 articles (summing up Jane, Charlotte, & Thackeray) & feel like a drunkard who has successfully resisted three invitations to drink.

Walking with Clive over the instep of Firle Beacon the other night we talked of all this; he seriously advising me for my good to approach America; being, as I always think, an admirable man of business, & doing very well for himself. And we talked about the future of the press & of the novel; he shrewd on both these questions, though perhaps I shall find my own opinions earning good money in his name in America. Through the pheasant wood we came, & by the cornfields; & I made up a sentence about paint with a yellow glaze on it to express the warm deep colours, laid so thickly upon field & down, & overlaid with some varnish so that it glowed, not raw, but under skilful preservation. There was Maynard, Duncan, Nessa; & we broached the new studio, where I sat with the painters all the next morningâ€”talking, talkingâ€”till, as I say, the Brocks came, & we turned intelligent & cultured again. I rode home over the fieldsâ€”one of the few days which are, as I maintain, days: the usual windy rainy weather being the variety & deviation. All being prepared, down to chicken & tongue, Molly H. of course did not comeâ€”her mother taking the occasion to fall from a ladder.

By opening the garden door I enlarge our garden so far as Mount Caburn. There I walk in the sunset; when the village climbing the hill has a solemn sheltering lookâ [,] pathetic, somehow, emblematic, anyhow very peaceful & human, as if people sought each others company at night, & lived trustfully beneath the hills. The old whitehaired women sit on the doorstep till 9 or so, then go in; & the light is lit in the upper window & all is dark by ten oâ€™clock. I had reason to observe nocturnal habits last night, for after my recuperative draught was over, Lottie was still not home; & when 10 struck L. determined to go in search. Bicycling alone along a road in ruts in the dark she might well have fallenâ€”& so forth. I went on foot up to the cross roads; thus passing all the men coming back from the public house, & saying more â€˜Good nightsâ€™ than in a week of daylightâ€”proving what Iâ€™ve said of the sociability of nightfall. Then, too, theyâ€™d had their lamps lit for them by Mr Malthouseâ€™s beer. Presumably every man in the place spends his evenings in the public house of course; & I should like once in a way to hear their talk. (George Sturgeon, who came with Flora on Sunday, has disillusioned me with country talkâ€”his is all of cricket & tennisâ€”coarse shapes of humanity appearing through the haze, all stamped according to their position in Lewes societyâ€”I dont think the intelligentzia need fear, either on earth or in Heaven, the competition of these simple naturesâ€”for stupidity, buttressing itself with all the conventions & prejudices is not nearly so humane as we free thinkers are). Then the clover smelt sweet up by the corner; & there was Lewes flashing, truthfully speaking with a kind of diamond brilliance, & the sky all powdered with stars, grey with them, since the moon was not up. L. found Lottie at the level crossing, her bicycle punctured, her lamps out, but hilarious & loquacious as a jay in the sun light.
