### Tuesday 10 August

I have spent the whole afternoon yellow washing the earth closet. I can now reckon up my labours: dining room distempered & cleaned; bannisters painted blue; stairs white; & now the earth closet. Tea comes quick; post (with luck) in the middle of tea; then a lounge in the garden; then Mrs Thomsett round with the plates; green shaded lamp lit, & beneath it we sit ostensibly reading till 10.30: when candles are fetched, & we plod yawning up stairs. Our beds have dents & hollows; but we sleep till Mrs Thomsett calls us. She is one of the most punctual. But then Mr Thomsett is out with his cattle at 5. Perhaps itâ€™s his boots that sometimes wake meâ€”The cattle go down to the brooks. Mr Arblasterâ€™s motor car pants under the window.

Coming home from Rat Farm on Sunday, a hot still day, Leonard initiated a scheme for the future of the Press. We are going to offer Partridge a share in it, baiting this perhaps minute titbit with the plumper morsel of secretaryship to L. About the middle of dinner L. developed this further: why not install Partridge at Suffield, & buy a complete printing outfit? Why not? Run a shop there too, perhaps. Ramifications spring unceasingly from this centre. The whole depends, however, upon Partridge, who has been invited here. Its a pleasant thing, come autumn, to make plans. Nelly still mysteriously diseased, & that being so we implore her to stay awayâ€”

Reading Don Q. stillâ€”I confess rather sinking in the sandâ€”rather soft goingâ€”so long as the stories arenâ€™t about himâ€”but has the loose, far scattered vitality of the great books, which keeps me goingâ€”

â€˜Potterismâ€™â€”by R. Macaulay, a donâ€™s book, hard-headed, masculine, atmosphere of lecture room, not interesting to meâ€”

Catherine Wilmot, who went on a tour in 1802â€”& kept a diary; but I have not yet got in to herâ€”a necessary process. Now to pick sweet peas.
