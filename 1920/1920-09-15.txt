### Wednesday 15 September

Nelly by the way has now had, I suppose every organ in her body examined, & is pronounced healthy with the exception of her teeth. So that shot of mine seems the true one;â€”but I confess I donâ€™t look forward to the winter. The fact is the lower classes are detestable.

Something of that reflection I owe to Lytton who has been with us from Friday to Tuesday, & now that the rain is come, I observe maliciously, is with the Hutches at Wittering (Never does Mary darken my door, or shadow my lawn again, I observe)â€”And that too comes from Lyttonâ€”its a consequence of walking all along the flats with him, on a brilliant evening, so up by Northease farm onto the downs. His admiration of the place made up for all disparagement. But see how many little facts, sayings, points of view I collected from himâ€”that Mary dislikes me â€˜very feminineâ€™, that Clive is a buffoon, that the lower classes are vulgar & stupid, that the Selby Biggs are useless & pretentious, that we only remainâ€”but that the worldâ€™s very amusing & pleasant, on the whole, society agreeable, â€˜women essentialâ€™; & I think there are one or two doubts of his about the value of his work compared with creating a world of oneâ€™s own.

Then â€˜Life is very complexâ€™â€”this murmured, as if intimate, referring to his own difficulties, which I had explained to me on the Roman Road. A repetition of Nick & Barbara Bagenal Câ arrington lives with Partridge, till Christmas, then comes to a decision. And we walked all the way to Kingston, talking, back over the flats, talking. Save for shadows that cross & leave him ruffled, he is now uniformly amiable, & takes pains at tableâ€”so that something is always on foot. At night we had the first two or three chapters of Victoriaâ€”Disgraceful to say I was twice overcome with sleep, owing to our wood fire; but the liveliness of it is such as to make one forget whether its good or not. I dont know what qualities it has. I suspect it depends too much upon amusing quotations, & is too much afraid of dulness to say anything out of the way. Not at all a meditative or profound book; on the other hand, a remarkably composed & homogeneous book. I doubt whether these portraits are trueâ€”whether thats not too much the conventional way of making historyâ€”But I think Iâ€™m coloured by my own wishes, & experimental mood. A miracle in the matter of condensation & composition I suspect. But we are to read it when done. Blessed with fine weather, I could look from my window, through the vine leaves, & see Lytton sitting in the deck chair reading Alfieri from a lovely vellum copy, dutifully looking out words. He wore a white felt hat, & the usual grey clothes; was long, & tapering as usual; looking so mild & so ironical, his beard just cut short. As usual; I got my various impressions: of suavity, a gentle but inflexible honesty; lightning speed; something peevish & exacting; something incessantly living, suffering, reflecting moods. Still he can withdraw in that supercilious way that used to gall me; still show himself superior to me, contemptuous of meâ€”of my morality, that is, not of my mind. For my own encouragement, I may note that he praised the Voyage Out voluntarily; â€œextremely goodâ€ it seemed to him on re-reading, especially the satire of the Dalloways. Night & Day he judges better, on the whole. Well, I can walk & talk with him by the hour.

I should have made more of my release from reviewing. When Iâ€™d sent my letter to Richmond, I felt like someone turned out into the open air. Now Iâ€™ve written another in the same sense to Murry, returning Mallock; & I believe this is the last book any editor will ever send me. To have broken free at the age of 38 seems a great piece of good fortuneâ€”coming at the nick of time, & due of course to L. without whose journalism I couldnâ€™t quit mine. But I quiet my conscience with the belief that a foreign article once a week is of greater worth, less labour, & better paid than my work; & with luck, if I can get my books done, we shall profit in moneymaking eventually. And, when one faces it, the book public is more of an ordeal than the newspaper public, so that Iâ€™m not shirking responsibility. Now, of course, I can scarcely believe that I ever wrote reviews weekly; & literary papers have lost all interest for me. Thank God, Iâ€™ve stepped clear of that Athenaeum world, with its reviews, editions, lunches, & tittle tattleâ€”I should like never to meet a writer again. The proximity of Mr Addison, reputed editor of The Field, is enough for me. I should like to know masses of sensitive, imaginative, unselfconscious unliterary people, who have never read a bookâ€”Now, in the rain, up to Dean, to talk about the door of the coal cellar.
