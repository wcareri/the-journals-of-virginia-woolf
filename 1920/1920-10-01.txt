### Friday 1 October

Here we are at the last day; the boxes with apples standing openâ€”this book left out by mistake, so that I take the opportunityâ€”Yes; undoubtedly the best summer so far, in spite of execrable weather, no bath, one servant, & an E.C. down a winding glade. To that verdict we both set our hands. The place is enchanting, & though in my jealous moods Iâ€™ve reconnoitred & scrutinised every other house, on the whole I decide that this is best. Even the schoolchildrenâ€™s voices, if one thinks of them as swifts & martins skirling round the eaves, exhilarate instead of annoying. We now give them apples, rejecting their pence, & requiring in return that they shall respect the orchard. They had already stripped several trees. As I say the time has vanished, & we are back before we have been here. Nelly, by the way, returns. I must try to say nothing sharp, though inclined to. After all, without education,â€”there are excuses.

I have neither written nor read since Monday, owing to a threatening of headache. It was this, not Eliot I suppose, that broke off Jacob. Very slowly the well, so dry last week, seems to be re-filling. I could invent againâ€”But first I must do Evelyn, then, perhaps, Women. I think Richmond will take as many articles from me as necessaryâ€”Murry, I notice, answers nothing; neither prints nor returns my story. Are these the manners of the underworldâ€”what I call â€˜showing offâ€™? It doesnâ€™t much matter. I had my account from Gerald this morningâ€”a little disappointing, I thinkâ€”Iâ€™ve sold 500 since Januaryâ€”which makes 1600 in all; in 8 months that is. Now it will slack off, & creep very slowly to the 2,000. I donâ€™t very much careâ€”but then, it gets more & more doubtful if I shall make enough money this way. Rowntree has quarrelled with the Contemporary & brought L.â€™s supplement to an end. We lose Â£250 a yearâ€”& this is the most serious part of it, for the supplement was scarcely worth while in that form. We find ourselves free howeverâ€”& so speculate about travelâ€”Italy, Greece, Franceâ€”Oh well, we rummage in the great bran pie very energeticallyâ€”Why not install Partridge, let Hogarth, & kick up our heels? Nessaâ€”did I sayâ€”? has invented Major Grant & his equipage in the basement & thus gets rid of cooks. All houses will be run like this in a few years. And now its clearing: blue sky with ice bergs. I must go & see Mr Botten about sending butter. One of the charms of Rodmell is the human life: everyone does the same thing at the same hour: when the old vicar performs erratically on the bells, after churching the women, everybody hears him, & knows what heâ€™s up to. Everyone is in his, or their garden; lamps are lit, but people like the last daylight, which was brown purple last night, heavy with all this rain. What I mean is that we are a community.
