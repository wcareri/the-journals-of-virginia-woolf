It would be easy to take up the line that Rogerâ€™s praise is not worth having, since it is balanced by what appears an irrational prejudice. If the prejudice is on your side, well & good; though even so it sweeps one too far to leave one steady in the head. I sometimes fancy that the only healthy condition is that of doing successful work. Its the prime function of the soul. R.â€™s work never meeting with the right sort of appreciation, he suffers perpetually from an obscure irritation. The main form it takes is irritation against England; I fancy I can trace it elsewhere also. He is testy without much occasion, & too easily reverts to grievances, how art critics hate him, how its only in France that they care for his picturesâ€”why, he was accusing Clive of taking his ideas & selling them to America for Â£200â€”but on this point I happen to agree with him. If Iâ€™m sincere, however, I see that Iâ€™m led to infer all this from what I note in my own disposition under a cloud. For one thing, I find it difficult to write. I held my pen this morning for two hours & scarcely made a mark. The marks I did make were mere marks, not rushing into life & heat as they do on good days. Perhaps Roger was the first cloud; Desmond may have contributed a little; & then how many silly things I did yesterday, ending by ringing up the Richmonds at their dinner, & being painfully snubbed by Elena on that account. I should like here to analyse; instead I must wash & dress & dine at the Club & so to Moll Hamiltonâ€™s party, which I predict will be dull, & more shocks will be administered, & I shall creep cold to bed.
