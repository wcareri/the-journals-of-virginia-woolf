It is worth mentioning, for future reference, that the creative power which bubbles so pleasantly on beginning a new book quiets down after a time, & one goes on more steadily. Doubts creep in. Then one becomes resigned. Determination not to give in, & the sense of an impending shape keep one at it more than anything. Iâ€™m a little anxious. How am I to bring off this conception? Directly one gets to work one is like a person walking, who has seen the country stretching out before. I want to write nothing in this book that I dont enjoy writing. Yet writing is always difficult.

L. is up in London seeing his constituents. Eight gentlemen are waiting on him to learn his views. Then heâ€™s having tea with Kot. He has a meeting (I think) wonâ€™t be home till late. I spent the afternoon typing & setting up Morganâ€™s story. Went out to buy a bun, called on Miss Milan about the chair covers, & when Iâ€™ve done this, I shall read Berkeley. At 2.15 Lady Cynthia Curzon was married to Captain Mosley. Though it was summer till 3.30, it is now brushed with blackness, & I must shut the window & put on my jersey. Nessa comes back on Friday. Clive & Mary are in Paris. Then, I had tea with A. & K. on Sunday & saw all the childrenâ€”Judith a great lump of a child; Ann with a look of the Wattsâ€™ drawing of mother; yet both a good deal like Costelloes. I like coming back to Richmond after Gordon Sqre. I like continuing our private life, unseen by anyone. Murry has asked me to write stories for the Athenaeum. No mention of Kâ atherineâ€™s wishing to see me.
