### Thursday 20 May

Iâ€™m filling my empty tank as fast as I canâ€”for some reason, Iâ€™ve been in after tea lately, too lazy to read Greek, & rejected by the Times, though not by the Womanâ€™s Times, by the by. A light article needed on Psychology of War Widows. All the burden & glory of reviewing falls on L. & I get on with Jacobâ€”the most amusing novel writing Iâ€™ve done, I think; in the doing I mean. Up yesterday with peonies to Nessa; heard of the mysterious letters from the grave (but this story isnâ€™t recordedâ€”her maids disasters) also the money difficulties which threaten Maynard & through him, her. Gambling on the exchange is the technical name of it, & things rising for the moment, he loses. The question is how long he can hold out; triumph certain in the end, a crash that is. The war has put its skeleton fingers even into our pockets.

Then I went on with L. to dine with the Coles in Chelseaâ€” The Coles are Webbs in embryoâ€”with differences of course. Iâ€™m used to being at ease with clever young men, & to find myself stumped, caught out, leg before the wicket at every turn is not pleasant. Never was there such a quick, hard, determined young man as Cole; covering his Labour sympathies, which are I suppose intellectual, with the sarcasm & sneers of Oxford. Then thereâ€™s a bust of Wâ illiam. Morris on the side board, too much to eat, Morris curtains, all the works of all the classics, & Cole & Mrs hopping on the surface like a couple of Cockney sparrows incapable of more than pecks & sips which they do too skilfully for my taste. The whole effect as of electric light full in the eyesâ€”unbecoming at my age. I think the irritation rose partly from a sense that his cleverness was inaccessible. Then they call each other â€˜darlingâ€™. Then there were Mr & Mrs Mair, from Government offices, jokes about Beveridge & Shaw, & David Mair subsiding into complete silence in the background till taken home by his broad browed, loquacious wife in the ragâ gâ ed petticoat. One can see Mrs Cole rapidly becoming the cleverish elderly fox terrier type of intellectual womanâ€”as it is not a shade or valley in her mind. Cole, grinning like a gutterpipe demon took us to the doorâ€”so spry, alert, virile, & ominous.

I have written to Katherine. No answer. Mr Lynd reviewed me in the Nation.
