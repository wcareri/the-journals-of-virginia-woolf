### Wednesday 5 May

We have had a Thursday to Tuesday at Rodmell; which accounts, as I say, making my apology to this book, in which so few pages seem to have been written. As we sat down to dinner on Saturday, Desmond rapped at the doorâ€”To follow this up to its source, I should describe dinner at 46: Desmond, Lytton & Mary there; but I donâ€™t much like describing dinners at 46. Desmond (this is L.â€™s saying not mine, & I quote it to avoid speaking grudgingly myself) produces a sense of frowst in the room. It rained; he lay back, smoking cigarettes eating sweets & opening novels which he never read. Being an editor has drugged the remnants of ambition in him, & he is now content. Content is disillusioning to behold: what is there to be content about? It seems, with Desmond now, always afternoon.

We worked at Kotâ€™s book. Have I left him out too? His clasp of the hand crushes the little bones: his hand though inches thick is hard as bone, & typifies that dense, solid, concentrated man. He always speaks the truth, & gropes after it in psychologyâ€”rather a queer thing to do, & laying waste many a fair garden. As he says a thing, it sounds so convincing. We are publishing Gorki, & perhaps this marks some step over a precipiceâ€”I donâ€™t know. He analysed Murry in this devastating way. K. is back I suppose; & I amuse myself with playing at the silly gameâ€”whoâ€™s to take the first step: I predict here that perhaps Murry willâ€”if not, we dont meet for a year or two.

But hurry on to the climaxâ€”Massingham has offered Leonard Brailsfordâ€™s post on the Nationâ€”to do the foreign article that is, drawing Â£400 a year. The drawback is that it means going up every Monday, perhaps Wednesdays, thus ties us tight. If this can be arranged, all else is satisfactory. He could drop his reviewing; do better work; get better pay; & perhapsâ€”my private aim is to drop my reviewing too. But that doesnâ€™t matter. I own I like a good compliment to L.: not boastfully; it seems right, I suppose. So now our fortunes look up again. Lytton dined here last night, & seemed confident, happy,â€”about to begin on Vic. in earnest. Chatto & Windus must have notice in order that they may lay in large stocks of paper in time.
