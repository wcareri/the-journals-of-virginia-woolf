The pain from Walkley is dying out, since Iâ€™ve begun Jacobâ€™s Room. I can inhibit poor L. as I myself am inhibited. Your trick is repetition, I say: whereupon his pen sticks like a broken machine. To the Bach festival last night; & coincidence led me to run at once into two people Iâ€™ve not met for an age, Noel, for one; then, as I settled into my seat, a voice said Virginia! It was Walter Lamb. The egg shaped manâ€”the billiard ball manâ€”sat by me, & told me a great deal about Bach. Bach was very beautiful, though the human element in the choir always distracts me. They arenâ€™t beautiful; all in greens, greys, pinks, blacks, fresh from the suburbs & high tea. The hall seemed to suit them better than the music. Home with Walter. â€œI had such a vivid dream of Thoby the other nightâ€ he said. â€œHe came in after beagling, & said, something very importantâ€”I canâ€™t remember what. Very oddâ€”for I donâ€™t think of him often.â€ He was glad to tell me this. I make him tell me about his Royalties. In fact hereâ€™s a secret that mustnâ€™t be repeatedâ€”Walter is writing Prince Albertâ€™s Academy speech for him. He has a nimble mind, & makes himself much at home in his corner of the world; indeed heâ€™s one of the people for whom the world was made the shape it is. I wonder whether admiration of oneâ€™s own family is snobbish, or somehow the product of love: he seems to love Dorothy & Henry in this particular way.
