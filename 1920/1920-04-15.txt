### Thursday 15 April

My handwriting seems to be going to the dogs. Perhaps I confuse it with my writing. I said that Richmond was enthusiastic over my James article? Well, two days ago, little elderly Walkley attacked it in The Times, said Iâ€™d fallen into H.J.â€™s worst mannerismsâ€”hard beaten â€˜figuresâ€™â€”& hinted that I was a sentimental lady friend. Percy Lubbock was included too; but, rightly or wrongly, I delete the article from my mind with blushes, & see all my writing in the least becoming light. I suppose its the old matter of â€˜florid gushâ€™â€”no doubt a true criticism, though the disease is my own, not caught from H.J., if thats any comfort. I must see to it though. The Times atmosphere brings it out; for one thing I have to be formal there, especially in the case of H.J.; & so contrive an article rather like an elaborate design; which encourages ornament. Desmond, however, volunteered admiration. I wish one could make out some rule about praise & blame. I predict that Iâ€™m destined to have blame in any quantity. I strike the eye; & elderly gentlemen in particular get annoyed. An unwritten novel will certainly be abused; I canâ€™t foretell what line theyâ€™ll take this time. Partly, its the â€˜writing wellâ€™ that sets people offâ€”& always has done, I suppose. â€˜Pretentiousâ€™ they say; & then a woman writing well, & writing in The Timesâ€”thatâ€™s the line of it. This slightly checks me from beginning Jacobâ€™s room. But I value blame. It spurs one, even from Walkley; who is (Iâ€™ve looked him out) 65, & a cheap little gossip, Iâ€™m glad to think, laughed at even by Desmond. But donâ€™t go forgetting that thereâ€™s truth in it; more than a grain in the criticism that Iâ€™m damnably refined in The Times: refined & cordial: I donâ€™t think its easy to help it: since, before beginning the H.J. article, I took a vow Iâ€™d say what I thought, & say it in my own way. Well, Iâ€™ve written all this page, & not made out how to steady myself when the Unwritten Novel appears.

Rain has comeâ€”what I mind much more is the black sky: so ugly. Yesterday I think I was unhappy all day long. First, Walkley; then 2 teeth out; then tooth ache all the evening; L. out to speak in Richmond; & couldnâ€™t read because of the throb in my gum. The day before I went to the Niggersâ€™ show in Chelsea; very sad impressive figures; obscene; somehow monumental; figures of Frenchmen, I thought, sodden with civilisation & cynicism; yet they were carved (perhaps) in the Congo 100â€™s of years ago. Hannay came up. â€˜Mrs Woolf?â€™ Yesâ€”but whoâ€”? We met years ago at the Squiresâ€”Hannay. Ah, you do art criticism now? Tell me what I ought to think of the carvings. And these Peruvian bowlsâ€”Its the shape, in the bowls. Iâ€™ve lived too long with the carvings. (I donâ€™t think this expresses him, though. A man who spaces his words with long silencesâ€”a bad critic Iâ€™m told. As one would expect of anyone working at the bookshop.) Then I heard Desmond saying O its upstairsâ€”but in he came with a tall lean brown elderly man in frock coat & top hat. Not introduced to me, as though there were a gulf between us. I slipped out into Chelsea Church, & saw the tablet to H.J.â€”florid & cultivated if you likeâ€”spindly letters, & Jamesian phrases. Perhaps by Gosse. So to Madame GravÃ©â€™sâ€”so to the 17 Clubâ€”so home. & then my tooth was beginning.

What book can I settle to read? I want something that wont colour my mornings moodâ€”something a little severe. My notion is to write this in chapters straight off; not beginning one unless I can count on so many days clear for finishing it.
