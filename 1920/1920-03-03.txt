### Wednesday 3 March

So then at the end of that week we went to Rodmell, & are back again two days ago. But Iâ€™ve numbers of old clothes in my dirty clothes basketâ€”scenes, I mean, tumbled pell mell into my receptacle of a mind, & not extracted till form & colour are almost lost. I suppose â€˜going out to teaâ€™ continued; oh, there was a dinner at Gordon Square, when Mary, becoming almost peevish in her bedroom refused to part with hair pins: I made a note of that scene; & have branded her â€˜stupidâ€™â€”can one say vulgar? I think not. But dressing for gentlemen induces some disease of the complexion when examined by pure feminine light. Desmond was there: Desmond warm, affectionate, the oldest friend, so I sometimes feel; perhaps the best. I was touched, that is, that he ran along the platform to wish me goodnight. Then we sold Uncle Thoby for Â£150 to Mr Prinsep: & directly I got the cheque I regretted itâ€”oh dearâ€”again. Iâ€™m learning this trick, & wake saying it.

Then there was Rogerâ€™s speech at the Club & my first effortâ€”5 minutes consecutive speakingâ€”all very brilliant, & opening the vista of that form of excitement not before glimpsed at. Dined with Nessa & Duncan in Soho. Saw the woman drop her glove. A happy evening. Eliot & Sydney dineâ€”Sydney righting himself after our blow about Suffieldâ€”not without a grampus sigh or soâ€”Then off to Monksâ€”& here I should write large & bright about the SPRING. It has come. It has been with us over a fortnight. Never did a winter sleep more like an infant sucking its thumb. Daffodils all out; garden set with thick golden crocuses; snowdrops almost over; pear trees budding; birds in song; days like June with a touch of the sunâ€”not merely a painted sky but a warm one. Now weâ€™ve been to Kew. I assure you, this is the earliest & loveliest & most sustained spring I remember. Almond trees out.
