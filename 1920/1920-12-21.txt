### Tuesday 21 December

I add a postscript, observing that its the shortest day of the year, &, L. announces, the first of winter. But I want to note these things. I went to Farnham yesterday. Suburban society on the Bus going up. Young man back from city. Young woman been shopping. â€œHad a good day? Shall I take your parcels.â€ â€œNo; you might run away with them.â€ Arch badinage. Oh terrible country! Like a giant hen run. Half built houses everywhere. Roads scratched. Heath sandy & mangy. Dinner with Cases. Red light on dog legsâ€”leads me to say â€œHow romantic other peopleâ€™s lives are!â€ Suddenly the waits start. Scene flooded, of course: Janet not eating her maccaroni till theyâ€™d done. After dinner sitting over the fire, door half shut as usual. A mouse came outâ€”â€œA nice gentlemanâ€™s mouseâ€ I said. Consternation on part of Emphie. â€œBut what are we to do? Iâ€™m thinking of that mouse. You can set a trap for rats but not for mice. Seems so craftly.â€ â€œWell then keep a catâ€â€”â€œYes thats natureâ€™s way after allâ€”â€ â€œOr leave it aloneâ€ â€œOh dear no. Mice eat books; besides, theyâ€™re so dirty. Dear me Janet, I wish we hadnâ€™t got a mouse.â€ Question why K.M. is indecentâ€”â€œSo silly, I thinkâ€ says Emphie. â€œMight as well talk of washing oneâ€™s hands.â€ Biscuit & chocolate by my bed, on a small white mat, & so on. What else? oh yes: neighbours. Miss Leonard calling. â€œA name you donâ€™t often hear. But theres a bootmaker in Oxford called Leonard. My brother had a pair of boots made there. His wife didnâ€™t quite like it oh eh ha ho!â€ (little laughs like notes of a flute). â€˜Mr Minchin writes reviews for the Spectator.â€™ said with great awe. Parrotâ€™s hot stuffâ€”Parrotâ€™s a slack lot. Oh Parrotâ€”Parrotâ€™s put a sink in the front kitchenâ€”Everyone abuses Parrot. Emphie has discovered honey at Batâ€™s Corner, unknown to oldest resident.

We should be dining with Nessa &c: but have been put off; & oh dear, Iâ€™m glad to sit over the fireâ€”& how could I if I lived in London?
