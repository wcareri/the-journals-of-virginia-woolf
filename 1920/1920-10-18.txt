### Monday 18 October

This is a long break, & perhaps I should not fill it now if it were not that I am in from the Club, & canâ€™t settle to anything. Yet we have been back seventeen days, have seen a number of people, & harboured more thoughts than there are words in my mind for: here L. came in, & told me that Rowntree wants to reconsider the death of the Supplement; will almost certainly keep it on, with a smaller staff. Iâ€™m afraid I wasnâ€™t pleased; for here we are tied again, L. accepting Â£200 instead of Â£250; & no chance of Italy. We argued, & my fears were said to be foolish; & I daresay they are. Only Iâ€™m alarmed, sometimes, to think how easily L. might devote himself to a cause. I do my utmost to ruin his career.

Who have we seen? The usual people, Nessa & Duncan Clive Mary Stracheys Stephens, Ka, Arnold Forsters,â€”Kot, too, who came to bring us Tchehov, & was so excited over it & other projects as to twang like a fiddle, instead of solemnly resounding as usual like a full barrel of beer. We are well launched upon the work of the Press. Partridgeâ€”Ralph I should call himâ€”is putting his oxâ€™s shoulder to the wheel, & intends to do â€œhurricaneâ€ business. We are bringing out Three Stories by L.: my book; (printed for an experiment by McDermott;) & have in view Tchehov, Eliot, Roger, possibly Lyttonâ€™s essays; & now little priggish Mervyn A.F. wishes to employ us to print his â€˜rhymesâ€™,â€”which will be bad, but it is amusing to sell our skill.
