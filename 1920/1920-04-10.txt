### Saturday 10 April

We sped to Rodmell, which accounts for another formidable break. By the way, Morgan keeps a diary, & in his diary Morgan writes conversationâ€”word for word, when the humour takes him. I dont know that the humour takes me to describe our Easter at Monks House. Through the first week of it I was driven, as with shut eyes, eyes being indeed so intent upon Henry James as to see nothing else. That missive despatched, I got such pleasure out of everything that I keep putting houses & streetsâ€”yes & people tooâ€”against that background, & seeing them look flat & faded. Clive & Mary last night brought in the loud breezy atmosphere of the Brighton pier. We are getting middle aged. I see him stout, kindâ€”indeed cordialâ€”but so cynical as to be almost uninteresting. Poor Mary has little of the Brass Band about her; but much of the mute meretricious fille de joieâ€”Iâ€™ve said that partly for the sake of the mâ€™s; but thereâ€™s truth in it. Then, uncomfortably enough, I kept striking upon something soft & unprotected in herâ€”childish, pathetic almost. Sheâ€™s the mother of children too. I daresay what with one thing & another Iâ€™m grown rather brazenâ€”so many compliments (Oh, Morgan just now writes to say my memoir was â€˜splendidâ€™â€”& dare he ask me to review for the Heraldâ€”Desmond sends me stalls for the pioneers tomorrowâ€”Bruce Richmondâ€”but enough of quotations). Moreover, I can wince outrageously to read K.M.â€™s praises in the Athenaeum. Four poets are chosen; sheâ€™s one of them. Of course Murry makes the choice, & its Sullivan who rates her story a work of genius. Still, you see how well I remember all thisâ€”how eagerly I discount it.

To describe Monks House would be to trench upon literature, which I cant do here; since we only slept by snatches last night, & at 4 a.m. turned a mouse out of L.â€™s bed. Mice crept & rattled all night through. Then the wind got up. Hasp of the window broken. Poor L. out of bed for the 5th time to wedge it with a toothbrush. So I say nothing about our projects at Monks, though the view across meadows to Caburn is before me now; & the hyacinths blooming, & the orchard walk. Then being alone thereâ€”breakfast in the sunâ€”postsâ€”no servantsâ€”how nice it all is!

Iâ€™m planning to begin Jacobâ€™s Room next week with luck. (Thatâ€™s the first time Iâ€™ve written that.) Its the spring I have it in my mind to describe; just to make this noteâ€”that one scarcely notices the leaves out on the trees this year, since they seem never entirely to have gone inâ€”never any of that iron blackness of the chestnut trunksâ€”always something soft & tinted; such as I canâ€™t remember in my life before. In fact, weâ€™ve skipped a winter; had a season like the midnight sun; & now return to full daylight. So I hardly notice that chestnuts are outâ€”the little parasols spread on our window tree; & the churchyard grass running over the old tombstones like green water.

Mrs Ward is dead; poor Mrs Humphry Ward; & it appears that she was merely a woman of straw after allâ€”shovelled into the grave & already forgotten. The most perfunctory earth strewing even by the orthodox.
