This book is badly treated again; & I forget what my excuses areâ€”no desire to write in it the chief I expect. Now Iâ€™ve finished the Symposium [Plato] I may relent perhaps. The Waterlows dined last nightâ€”Dawks exactly like a squawking dab chick, waistless, in black, about to bear a child. She is a persistent, pertinacious woman, & keeps her end up by force of will. Beauty has not blessed her. Later she complained to me of her discontentâ€”how she feels small, insignificant purposeless. I sketched a plan of her life, to which facts do not correspond. Sydney boomed out in the background that he too was unhappy â€œof course Iâ€™m unhappyâ€”arenâ€™t we all unhappy?â€”isnâ€™t it inevitable, seeing that no one of us has any satisfactory scheme of things?â€ This quest for a scheme comes from living with Murry, who is in pursuit of one very laboriously, hunting it through the columns of the Athenaeum, for which reason Roger has broken with himâ€”& that too we discussed, & how he turned Dawks out of the house. I laughed a good deal, & cheered myself at their discontent. Molly & Desmond seem more seriously in debt than I realised; & have somehow warded off their creditors by mortgaging old Mrs MacCarthyâ€™s life. Poor Dawks, who has about Â£1600 a year complains of Johnâ€™s behaviour, which entirely ruins her day. So they take the children to the Zoo on Sundaysâ€”An odd looking coupleâ€”the wrong assortment. Unromanticâ€”terribly unromantic.

L. now translating Tchekov, & I must set to on my share, I suppose. Ralph comes twice a week or so, an indomitable, perhaps rather domineering, young man; loves dancing; in the pink of health; a healthy brain. He described a brothel the other nightâ€”how, after the event, he & the girl sat over the fire, discussing the coal strike. Girls paraded before himâ€”that was what pleased himâ€”the sense of power.
