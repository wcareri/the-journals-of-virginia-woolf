### Thursday 5 August

Let me try to say what I think as I read Don Quixote after dinnerâ€”Principally that writing was then story telling to amuse people sitting round the fire without any of our devices for pleasure. There they sit, women spinning, men contemplative, & the jolly, fanciful, delightful tale is told to them, as to grown up childrenâ€”This impresses me as the motive of D.Q., to keep us entertained at all costs. So far as I can judge, the beauty, & thought come in unawares; Cervantes scarcely conscious of serious meaning, & scarcely seeing D.Q. as we see him. Indeed thatâ€™s my difficultyâ€”the sadness, the satire, how far are they ours, not intendedâ€”or do these great characters have it in them to change according to the generation that looks at them? Much, I admit, of the tale-telling is dullâ€”not much, only a little at the end of the first volume, which is obviously told as a story to keep one contented. So little said out, so much kept back, as if he had not wished to develop that side of the matterâ€”the scene of the galley slaves marching is an instance of what I meanâ€”Did C. feel the whole of the beauty & sadness of that as I feel it? Twice Iâ€™ve spoken of â€˜sadnessâ€™. Is that essential to the modern view? Yet how splendid it is to unfurl oneâ€™s sail & blow straight ahead on the gust of the great story telling, as happens all through the first part. I suspect the Fernando-Cardino-Lucinda story was a courtly episode in the fashion of the day, anyhow dull to me. I am also reading Ghoa le Simpleâ€”bright, effective, interesting, yet so arid & spick & span. With Cervantes everythings there; in solution if you like; but deep, atmospheric, living people casting shadows solid, tinted as in life. The Egyptians, like most French writers, give you a pinch of essential dust instead, much more pungent & effective, but not nearly so surrounding & spacious. By God!â€”what stuff Iâ€™m writing! always these images.

I write Jacob every morning now, feeling each days work like a fence which I have to ride at, my heart in my mouth till its over, & Iâ€™ve cleared, or knocked the bar out. (Another image, unthinking it was one. I must somehow get Humeâ€™s Essays & purge myself).
