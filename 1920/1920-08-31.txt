### Tuesday 31 August

The last day of Augustâ€”& what a day! November in the city without the lights. Then the schoolchildren singing, & as I write Lottie chatter-chatteringâ€”so Iâ€™m out of mood. Detestable grey skyâ€”life has too few days to waste them thus. I must walk my temper off upon the downs. But first Iâ€™ve Partridge & Carrington to deal with. Another step has been taken in life: we have a partner & a secretary at a cost of Â£100. Rash, I suppose; but then whatâ€™s the point of life if oneâ€™s not rash? Anyhow we step out boldâ ly, & if the Press is to live, it had better run a risk or two. The young man, aged 26, just left Oxford, is a superb bodyâ€”shoulders like tough oak; health tingling beneath his skin. Merry shrewd eyes. Since George Sturgeon Iâ€™m shy of stupid young men; but P. hasnâ€™t that stupidity anyhow. He has been religious; is now socialistic; literature I donâ€™t suppose counts for much: heâ€™s written an essay on Milton, which C. was not struck by. Happily we had fine weather; & sat in the meadow & watched Squire & Sassoon play cricketâ€”the last people I wished to seeâ€”Somehow that the downs should be seen by cultivated eyes, self conscious eyes, spoils them to me. I wish there were nothing but Dedmans, Bottens & Staceys in the world; as they alone people the graveyards. Carrington is ardent, robust, scatterbrained, appreciative, a very humble disciple, but with enough character to prevent insipidity. A little ashamed of P., I thought her. But what shoulders! what thickness of bone! He is an admirer of L.â€™s. Well, how will it turn out? What shall we print? H.Â G. Wells has asked us to stay. What other news is there? The time seems to race ahead, broken into halves by the post; & Iâ€™ve such a litter of books to readâ€”though none to review. A cold, disappointing summer. Finished Sophocles this morningâ€”read mostly at Asheham.
