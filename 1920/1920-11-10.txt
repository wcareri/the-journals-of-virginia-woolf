### Wednesday 10 November

I have walked some way further along the strip of pavement without falling in. Business has kept me stepping out briskly, & then, making an effort, I bought a coat & skirt, & began my social winter at Mrs Samuel Bruceâ€™s, between Katie & Elena again, again hearing the same things, & saying the same things. Nelly Cecil spent the night with us, honest, humble, shabby, distinguished. The only people she likes are writers; her own friends she despises a little. De la Mare & Mary Coleridge she respects. Nessaâ€™s room at Gordon Square is becoming what the drawing room at 46 was 5 or 6 years ago. I go there & find that astonishing brightness in the heart of darkness. Julian coming in with his French lesson; Angelica hung with beads, riding on Rogerâ€™s foot; Clive claret coloured & yellow like a canary; Duncan vague in the background, sitting astride a chair, looking with blurred eyes rather dimly. Then we dined with Roger, & with the Sturgeons, & altogether I sometimes feel that not to have a refuge here would be a bad thingâ€”I donâ€™t know. Ralph hints at a plan of sharing a London house with usâ€”which tempts me, on some days. All three of us set up L.â€™s story this afternoon. Iâ€™ve been writing to finish my book; & not a word set to Jacob yet; & I must prepare a chapter for the memoir club; & so, in spite of no reviewing, I donâ€™t do as I planned. The house now runs very smoothly, indeed melodiously. Didnâ€™t I have tea off Nellyâ€™s butter? days fly as usual; & Iâ€™m writing a story to ask whyâ€”

L. at work on a book for Snowden: endlessly reviewing too; no news yet from Rowntree about the supt. & that reminds me of the pickle I got into over Evelyn in the Lit. Supt. last week. 4 mistakes in 4 columns.
