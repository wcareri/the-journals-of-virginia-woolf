### Tuesday 20 January

Years ago as a child I made up a wise saw to the effect that if one didnâ€™t expect a party to be nice it was & tâ€™other way round. So Desmondâ€™s visit was easy, refreshing, & passed without hitch. We had a fine store of talk to keep us going.â€”The story of his voyageâ€”of Captain Deakes & Captain Haines; their obscenity that made one sick; the squall at sea; arrival at Cape Town; Mrs Paleyâ€™s surprise; Paleyâ€™s greeting â€˜but we didnâ€™t expect youâ€”â€™ His wire â€˜Desmond sailedâ€™ arriving Desmond failedâ€”(as indeed he might probably have done)â€”all this in the lovely soft voice, with more than the usual freshness & abundance. As for decadence or decayâ€”not a trace of it: fresh & firm & friendly. Then much talk of the New Statesmanâ€”projects without numberâ€”to be noted down: letters to be written. Secretly, I think, he was much excited & pleased. Five hundred assured; 250 of it dependent on a weekly article, signed Affable Hawk (this is a dead secret). Off we went after tea to Rogerâ€™s, all across Europe to the Brecknock Arms. Buses pass you bound for Barnet. As we both depend upon holding to a button naturally we did not arrive easily. The house very high & narrow, with many large rooms, & a bright lining of pictures. Roger to my eyes slightly shrunken, aged? Can one use that word of him? And I donâ€™t know how much I colour him from my own depressionâ€”for I guessed he didnâ€™t much care for N. & D. So I went on to fancy him wilful; to trace veins of irrational prejudice in him. He showed freakish by side of D.â€™s benevolence; old sea captains telling dirty stories not in his line; nor novels either. Yet he professed to find it much superior to the Vâ oyage Oâ ut.
