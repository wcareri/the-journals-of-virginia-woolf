### Saturday 6 March

No sooner had I written this than Madame GravÃ© appeared, & has left only the wreck of an evening behind her. Still if I donâ€™t fill a page now, God knows when I shall again: an endless prospect of unrecorded activity now stretches before me: also behind. Did I say that Desmond & I cheered the return of Mr Asquith to Parliament? I saw a sleek white satiny looking bare head. Also Margot standing up, swaying slightly, & drawing her hands to & from her lips, while a policeman squirmed on the carriage roofâ€”always a touch of the grotesque in these proceedings, though emotions rose like a spring tide, & swept me off my feet, or rather elevated me unconsciously to a parapet, whence I saw the aforementioned bare white head. Tea with Molly & old Mrs MacCarthy; emotionsâ€”about the death of a friend; gossip about the Bluntsâ€™ law suit: Molly wearing 2 minute cows horns above her ears.

Then?â€”Tuesday & Wednesday here in Richmond printing Hope; & Elena dined with us on Tuesday & made a speech at the Guild, & presented me incidentally with one of those puzzles which I always get wrong I fancy. How far can she be talked to? Is her withdrawal shock or stupidity? Then this â€˜nicenessâ€™; what does it amount to? For seconds she can make me feel crude & provincial; then, as I say, thereâ€™s the silenceâ€”& Heaven knows what goes forward. The machine seems to stop. As for her liking or dislikingâ€”I know nothing about it. Her personal presenceâ€”so comely, stately & maternal always reduces meâ€”till I grate on the rocks of (I suppose) her indifference to my enthusiasm. I rather believe that the nice people feel more temperately & universally than we doâ€”& with none of our passion.

Then on Thursday, dine with the Macarthys, & the first Memoir Club meeting. A highly interesting occasion. Seven people readâ€”& Lord knows what I didnâ€™t read into their reading. Sydney, to whom the occasion was one of some importance, signified as much by reading us a dreamâ€”in reality a parable, to account for explain the seeming obtuseness of daylight Sydney by the imaginative power of dreaming Sydneyâ€”altogether a queer, self-conscious, self analytic performance, interesting to me. Clive purely objective; Nessa starting matter of fact: then overcome by the emotional depths to be traversed; & unable to read aloud what she had written. Duncan fantastic & tongueâ€”not tiedâ€”tongue enchanted. Molly literary about tendencies & William Morris, carefully composed at first, & even formal: suddenly saying â€œOh this is absurdâ€”I canâ€™t go onâ€ shuffling all her sheets; beginning on the wrong page; firmly but waveringly, & carrying through to the end. â€œThese meagre Welsh, these hard-headed Scotsâ€”I detest themâ€”I wanted to be the daughter of a French marquise by a misalliance withâ€”â€ That was the tone of itâ€”& then â€œthese mild weak Cornishesâ€. Roger well composed; story of a coachman who stole geraniums & went to prison. Good: but too objective. I doubt that anyone will say the interesting things but they canâ€™t prevent their coming out. Before this by the way, I saw Nessaâ€™s new home, no. 50, inspected Pippaâ€™s chaos at no. 51; & looked in upon Adrian & Karin doing biology in their dining room. Coming out we ran upon Jamesâ€”such is the rabbit warren nature of the place.

Poor Mills Whitham yesterday wanted praise of his book, & I hadnâ€™t read itâ€”poor manâ€”Sylvia a little depressedâ€”but then with a huâ sâ band in brown corduroys, writing country novelsâ€”unreadably badâ€”no wonder.
