### Wednesday 23 June

I lay in the shallow light, which should be written dark, I think, a long time, & then Moore came & took a cold bath at 1 in the morning, consequently I was too muddled next morning to follow his explanation of Berkeley. He has grown grey, sunken, toothless perhaps. His eyes small, watchful, but perhaps not so piercing as of old. A lack of mass, somewhere. He went off to take â€˜my baby for a walkâ€™. I dont see altogether why he was the dominator & dictator of youth. Perhaps Cambridge is too much of a cave. Yet (I donâ€™t attempt to balance this properly) of course thereâ€™s his entire innocency & shrewdness; not the vestige of falsehood obscuring him anywhere.

I was struggling, at this time to say honestly that I donâ€™t think Conradâ€™s last book a good one. I have said it. It is painful (a little) to find fault there, where almost solely, one respects. I cant help suspecting the truth to be that he never sees anyone who knows good writing from bad, & then being a foreigner, talking broken English, married to a lump of a wife, he withdraws more & more into what he once did well, only piles it on higher & higher, until what can one call it but stiff melodrama. I would not like to find The Rescue signed Virginia Woolf. But will anyone agree with this?â€”anyhow nothing shakes my opinion of a bookâ€”nothingâ€”nothing. Only perhaps if its the book of a young personâ€”or of a friendâ€”no, even so, I think myself infallible. Havenâ€™t I lately dismissed Murryâ€™s play, & exactly appraised K.â€™s story, & summed up Aldous Huxley, & doesnâ€™t it somehow wound my sense of fitness to hear Roger mangling these exact values? Poor Roger has only sold 3 or 4 sketches. There the innumerable pictures hang, like ugly girls at a dance, & no one bids a penny piece. According to Nessa, he can talk of nothing else, & theyâ€™re at their wits ends to say the right thingsâ€”since what is to be said, save that bad pictures donâ€™t sell?

I had one of my last teas at 5 Windmill Hill on Sunday, & though it was the last, it was not very agreeable. (That I see is not the way I mean to put itâ€”but a merry go round playing incessantly distracts me). Emphie I suppose interrupted 10 times. Janet reverted to details of selling furniture & the change to the country as if it weighed on her & she sought by making it all sound nice to convince herself. Then in would pop E. with a tea cup or a plated urn for me to look at. â€œThen weâ€™ve decided about Cellini & the Bible?â€ she would ask, which meant more explanations & diversions. I donâ€™t know what I wanted to talk aboutâ€”anything, I suppose, in preference to what was fairly exactly nothing. Then the level downpour of the rain was depressing too; & didnâ€™t I come home to find that Nelly had declared herself dying, sent for another doctor, & had entirely ruined poor L.â€™s evening. Sheâ€™s still in bed, seemingly ill as we were at Xmas; only now cheerful & sensible, & possibly to go home tomorrow, when we go to Monkâ€™s House. Each time one looks forward to that more; & its blazing hot; every plant with a frill of red & white even here; the new kitchen to be seen, all of which I must leave to describe later.
