### Sunday 5 December

The Memoir Club was fearfully brilliantâ€”I mean I was; & Leonard so much more impressive with so much less pains; & Morgan very professional; & Mary never laughed once at my jokes. Well, I shall laugh loud at hers next Wednesday to make up. For here I am skipped to December, & only writing now I fear because my brain is tired of reading Coleridge. Why do I read Coleridge? Is it partly the result of Eliot whom Iâ€™ve not read; but L. has & reviewed & praised into the bargain. Eliot & Goldie dined here tâ€™other nightâ€”a successful party. A cold in the head made me desperate like wineâ€”nothing seemed to matter. I laughed in the grim marble face & got a twinkle back. What a big white face he has beside Goldieâ€™s mobile brown monkey one! A mouth twisted & shut; not a single line free & easy; all caught, pressed, inhibited; but great driving power some whereâ€”& my word what concentration of the eye when he argues! We discussed criticism, & I find he thinks himself a poet. A little human laughter comes very welcome to him, as I guess, & I think he would willingly break up his formal ways. His details about his father in lawâ€™s appendicitis were very precise. My guess is that he wishes to detach himself from sets, & welcomes us as an escape. Thenâ€”what? Gerald Duckworth engaged to Miss Chadâ€”does that count as news? dinner at the Toynbees, but I cant go into that. What do I want to go into? How hard we workâ€”thats what impresses me this winter: every compartment stuffed tight, chiefly owing to the press. Whether we can keep it up, I donâ€™t know. Then, both so popular, so well known, so much respectedâ€”& Leonard 40, & I nearing it, so thereâ€™s not much to boast of. In my heart, too, I prefer the nondescript anonymous days of youth. I like youthful minds; & the sense that no oneâ€™s yet anybody. This refers, with shocking slovenlinessâ€”but what will you? I cant write 2,000 words an hour carefullyâ€”to tea with Miss Hussey at Cliffordâ€™s Inn. I dont know why I saw my own youth there: she on her own, a journalist, poor, untidy, enthusiastic; & a younger brother coming in, to tea; not so clever, at least not launched; awkward; oh but so young! Both going off to the play, as Adrian & I did, years ago; but perhaps sheâ€™s happier than I was. Figure a poverty stricken room; gas fire broken; margarine; one table; books, mostly cheap ones; writing table; no ornament or easy chairâ€”(perhaps I had it) dark november day; up several staircases; bath, kitchen behind a dingy curtain, & another woman sharing. We talked about the need of education. â€œSurely education must achieve somethingâ€ the brother stammered. She would have none of itâ€”clever, & paradoxical, & flightyâ€”advanced; but I forgive all that for the sake of youth.
