### Tuesday 20 April

Saw the birth of Kaâ€™s son in the Times this morning, & feel slightly envious all day in consequence. To the Bach choir last night; but one of our failures. Is it the weather? Iâ€™d made out on waking, such a perfect day; & one by one my events missed fire. Such a good morningâ€™s writing Iâ€™d planned, & wasted the cream of my brain on the telephone. Then the weather; great bouncing gusts all set about with rain soaking one; buses crowded; left typewriting paper in the bus; a long time waiting at the Clubâ€”then Bach unaccompanied isnâ€™t easyâ€”though at last (after L. had gone home) I was swept up to the heights by a song. Anna Magdalenaâ€™s song. I walked a few steps beyond Herbert Fisher coming out; followed him across the empty lamplit purlieus of Westminster, saw him step so distinguished, yet to my eye, so empty, into Palace Yard, & so to take part in ruling the Empire. His head bentâ€”legs a little waveringâ€”small feetâ€”I tried to put myself inside him, but could only suppose he thought in an exalted way which to me would be all bunkum. Indeed, I feel this more & more. Iâ€™ve had my dive into their heads & come out again, I think.

I forgot to say how Hussey came on Sunday uninvited, & we took her to Margaretâ€™s, & she talked such Stracheyese that I couldnâ€™t think much of what she said. Binding Hope now. The books I chose were Berkeley; Maynard; & now theyâ€™ve sent Tchehovâ€™s letters, & Barbellion. Never had so few to reviewâ€”none from The Times (A.B.Wâ alkley. perhaps responsible?) none from the Athenaeum; but Iâ€™ve plenty to do all the same.
