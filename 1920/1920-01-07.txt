### Wednesday 7 January

To begin the year on the last pages of my old bookâ€”the few Iâ€™ve not torn off for letter writingâ€”is all upside-down of course; but of a part with the character of the work.

This is our last evening. We sit over the fire waiting for postâ€”the cream of the day, I think. Yet every part of the day here has its meritsâ€”even the breakfast without toast. Thatâ€”however it beginsâ€”ends with Pippins; most mornings the sun comes in; we finish in good temper; & I go off to the romantic chamber over grass rough with frost & ground hard as brick. Then Mrs Dedman comes to receive ordersâ€”to give them, really, for she has planned our meals to suit her days cooking before she comes. We share her oven. The result is always savouryâ€”stews & mashes & deep many coloured dishes swimming in gravy thick with carrots & onions. Elsie, aged 18, can be spoken to as though she had a head on her shoulders. The house is empty by half past eleven; empty now at five oâ€™clock; we tend our fire, cook coffee, read, I find, luxuriously, peacefully, at length.

But I should not spend my time on an indoor chronicle; unless I lazily shirked the describing of winter down & meadowâ€”the recording of what takes my breath away at every turn. Heres the sun out for example & all the upper twigs of the trees as if dipped in fire; the trunks emerald green; even bark bright tinted, & variable as the skin of a lizard. Then theres Asheham hill smoke misted; the windows of the long train spots of sun; the smoke lying back on the carriages like a rabbits lop ears. The chalk quarry glows pink; & my water meadows lush as June, until you see that the grass is short, & rough as a dogfishes back. But I could go on counting what Iâ€™ve noticed page after page. Every day or nearly Iâ€™ve walked towards a different point & come back with a string of these matchings & marvels. Five minutes from the house one is out in the open, a great pull over Asheham; &, as I say, every direction bears fruit. Once we went over the cornfield & up onto the downâ€”a dim Sunday afternoonâ€”muddy on the road, but dry up above. The long down grass pale, & as we pushed through it, up got a hawk at our feet, seeming to trail near the ground, as if weighted downâ€”attached to something. It let the burden fall, & rose high as we came up. We found the wings of a partridge attached to a bleeding stump, for the Hawk had almost done his meal. We saw him go back to find it. Further down the hill side a great white owl â€˜wavyâ€™ (for that describes his way of weaving a web round a treeâ€”the plumy soft look of him in the dusk adding truth to the word) â€˜wavy in the duskâ€™, flew behind the hedge as we came past. Village girls were returning, & calling out to friends in doors. So we cross the field & churchyard, find our coke burnt through to red, toast the breadâ€”& the evening comes.

L. has spent most of his time pruning the apple trees, & tying plums to the wall. To do this he wears two jackets, 2 pairs of socks, two pairs of gloves; even so the cold bites through. These last days have been like frozen water, ruffled by the wind into atoms of ice against the cheek; then, in the shelter, forming round you in a still pool. Yesterday I explored towards the house with the white chimneys, finding a grass drive all the way; brooks struck off to the right blue as if with sea water. From one a snipe rose zigzagging across & across, flurried & swift. As I advanced the peewits rose in clouds, one dallying behind, & crying peewit, peewit. Then up in the air across the meadows one sees the (the postâ€”but only Mathewâ€™s letter) handful of grain flung in a semi circle what birds they are I never know. On the down this afternoon I saw the usual flight go up in front of me, & then half wheeled round tâ€™other way. Bells tinkling as I walked along the valley came from a flock attached to the green side, & there on the top against the sky was a string of three great cart horses, stock still, as on a summers day; for they were beside a corn stack. And this I see is my last page so my threat about counting things to that limit was a true one. Human beings have figured less than the red berries, the suns & the moon risings. Letters have come still, as usual, about Nâ ight & Dâ ay, from Sheppard & Roger; both the kind I like; & old Kitty Maxse sees nothing but stupidity, which donâ€™t hurt muchâ€”but Iâ€™m ashamed of beginning the year with this gossip. Reading Empire & Commerce to my genuine satisfaction, with an impartial delight in the closeness, passion, & logic of it; indeed its a good thing now & then to read oneâ€™s husbands work attentively. For the rest, the Education of Henry Adams, &â€”? I wrote my article on English prose for Murry; & now finish Rosetti, taking leave still from the Times.
