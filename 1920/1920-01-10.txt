### Saturday 10 January

Ah, thatâ€™s all very well, but a fate conspires against a solemn opening ceremony. True, Iâ€™ve taken a new nib; but Iâ€™m perched high in bug chair, & canâ€™t settle to read or write, waiting for Lotty to bring in tin tacks, with which to mend my aged broken down eared arm chair. Entrails years ago burst their barriers, & for the past six months Iâ€™ve sat on a ridge of wood. Leonard suddenly undertakes to confine entrails within sacking; but we wait for Lotty. A five minutes walk spreads to 45 with her; she calls on Miss Stanford.

So the New Year is broached; 10 days of it already spent. The 1917 Club has the merit of gathering my particular set to a bunch about 4.30 on a week day. There, returning on Thursday, I found Clive (I heard him from the stairs) Morgan, Fredegond & dim background figures just worth a nod turning out to be Oliviersâ€”varieties of Oliviers. Now Clive showed as gaslight beside Morganâ€™s normal dayâ€”his day not sunny or tempestuous but a day of pure light, capable of showing up the rouge & powder, the dust & wrinkles, the cracks & contortions of my poor parrokeet. He makes me feel the footlights myself. The blend of the two was not agreeable; or rather not comfortable. Morgan had a matron waiting for him in Leicester Square. Clive took me in a taxi to Regent Square, after making play with the name of Lytton Strachey. I ran up ahead, & found the room bright & lively; the baby crawling out to fill up a corner, Nessa in her spotted feather hat with the pink plume. I think she thus redeems the rest of her homespunâ€”very successfully. I also think (as Lotty wonâ€™t come inâ€”my evening wastingâ€”Lindsay to readâ€”oh dear) that my charms are beneath the horizon; Maryâ€™s about level with the eye; & Nessaâ€™s rising resplendent like the harvest moon. Why, otherwise, dwell so rapturously to me on her dress at the party, her beauty, her grandeur? God knowsâ€”perhaps to make himself shine brighter. A long yellow lock hung beneath his ear. â€œI must cut your hairâ€ said V. Whereupon he took his hat off quickly, fingered the long strand, recognised its missionâ€”to cover the bald patch. But it wouldnâ€™t stay, & fell back again a little repulsively, lacking grease to keep it in place. Compliments for me: but offered as if he were no longer the privileged purveyor. So home by Victoria, noticing there the hustler in his box.
