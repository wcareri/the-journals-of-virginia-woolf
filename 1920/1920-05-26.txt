### Wednesday 26 May

Running through this I see Iâ€™ve left out one or two important pieces in the mosaic. Massingham has written to ask L. to act as 2nd string in the foreign dept, during vacations, which we interpret to mean that Goldie has taken the 1st string. This suits us on the whole better than tâ€™other. Then L. has been adopted as the Labour candidate of the 7 Universities; may even be writing his letter of acceptance upstairs now. We are having the kitchen re-built at a cost of Â£80 at Monks House. And the night Morgan & Nessa dined here we saw a fire. Three minutes of excitementâ€”great flames shooting up behind the playground; then a glow as of red yellow gauze, with sparks rising & falling; then a lovely sight when the hose shot into the air, wrapping itself in light & soaring like a rocket. A pouring crackling noise all the time, & now & then wood crashing in. L. went out; & many people came trotting along in mackintoshes; 12 oâ€™clock being struck. The woman next door, wife of the fire-captain, rushed off distracted, & came home in tears, (so the servants sayâ€”they sat up, of course). And then Iâ€™m reviewed in the New Republic with high praiseâ€”indeed no blame. Is this typical of Americaâ€”more cordial to the English than we are to ourselves? This morning Katherine writes a stiff & formal note thanking me for my kind post card, & saying she will be delighted to see me, though â€˜grown very dullâ€™. What does this meanâ€”she hurt with me? Anyhow I go on Friday to find out, unless stopped as is always possible. I praised her story warmly; sincerely too.
