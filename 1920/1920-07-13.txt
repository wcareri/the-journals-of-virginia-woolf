### Tuesday 13 July

Oh the servants! Oh reviewing! oh the weather! Thus I try to get out of writing my proper account of things. Nelly has vacillated between tears & laughter, life & death for the past 10 days; canâ€™t feel an ache anywhere without sending for me or L. to assure her that aches are not certainly fatal. Then she cries. Never, never, never will she get over it, she says. The doctor comes. Innumerable pills & draughts consumed. Sweats, sleepless nights, recur. My private wonder is, as usual, how they contrive to live a weekâ€”arenâ€™t killed by the thunder, like flies. No root in reality is in them; & as for reason, when the moodâ€™s on, as soon might one persuade a runaway horse. And nothing the matter save what one of us would call an upset inside & take a pill for. This drives us to accept invitations, since if anyone comes here, the atmosphere lowers. But where have we been? Indeed I see myself cutting covers incessantly. I donâ€™t think the boom in Morgan will be sudden though. We are advertising in the Nation.

Now for oh Reviewing!â€”Three weeks I think have passed without a word added to Jacob. How is one to bring it through at this rate. Yet its all my faultâ€”why should I do the Cherry Orchard & Tolstoy for Desmond, why take up the Plumage Bill for Ray? But after this week I do no more. As for the weather, the sun shines in a modified way at this moment; so I will say no more, save that I donâ€™t suppose it will last, or do more than dry the topmost layer of earth upon what must be a swamp. Yet what am I thinking of? That Ka has taken the Eagleâ€™s Nest, & that I wish it were mine.
