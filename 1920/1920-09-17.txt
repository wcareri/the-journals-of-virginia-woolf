### Friday 17 September

Oh still in the rainâ€”the green I see through the window has a sulphur tint in itâ€”perhaps the evening sun is sinking behind Falmerâ€”but the rain rains so as to beat the asters to the ground & wet L. through, going & coming from the E.C. We have been into Lewes neverthelessâ€”by train, & walking home with knapsacks. I bought two pairs of stockings, L. a hair brush. We met Mr Thomas at the halt.

Rough weather! said Leonard.

â€œIt is! It is indeed. But then you see, we are already in autumn. And the sea is only three & a half miles away.â€ This he said nervously & eagerly, like a child; & then came out with his measurement, the fame of which has reached Rodmell already: 250 tons of rain fell the other night. But the harvest is in. What other news is there? L. caught a bat in our bedroom & killed it with a towel. I thought the lime tree was on us last night. We were wakened by a clap of thunder. Lottie spent the night at Charleston. I write this as if it were to be my last chance. Eliot comes tomorrow. We do not look forward lightly: but its interesting, which is always something. Iâ€™ve reached the party in Jacob & write with great pleasure.
