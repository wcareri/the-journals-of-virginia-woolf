### Tuesday 8 June

It is quite right to think of June in December, save that its a little over-fresh today, almost as if there were Brighton sea round the corner. One of my field days yesterdayâ€”National Galleryâ€”there met Cliveâ€”ices at Guntersâ€”much of a spectacleâ€”old black & white lady with a confidante observing manners & customs, benevolently, amused. Young man with a back like a clothesâ€™ horse hung with perfect grey clothesâ€”lithe women or girls with transparent legs tripping down into the shady cavesâ€”ices sucked or sipped in the strangest silenceâ€”two young ladies with their mother eating in complete silence: not a spark of life, properly dressed, from the country perhaps. But donâ€™t mothers & daughters ever talk? Would a young man have waked them? I could not say what went forward in those mute minds. Dine with Nessa. The whole story of Mary was told meâ€”a complete case of servantâ€™s hysteria; all coming, I think, from her wishing to act a day dream, & then, poor creature, stepping too far & believing it, & now babbling in St Paneras Infirmary. The sight of her taken off was sinister; & all the servants were looking from all the windows. What horrid people they are! This made my drive to Waterloo on top of a bus very vivid. A bright night; with a fresh breeze. An old beggar woman, blind, sat against a stone wall in Kingsway holding a brown mongrel in her arms & sang aloud. There was a recklessness about her; much in the spirit of London. Defiantâ€”almost gay, clasping her dog as if for warmth. How many Junes has she sat there, in the heart of London? How she came to be there, what scenes she can go through, I canâ€™t imagine. O damn it all, I say, why cant I know all that too? Perhaps it was the song at night that seemed strange; she was singing shrilly, but for her own amusement, not begging. Then the fire engines came byâ€”shrill too; with their helmets pale yellow in the moonlight. Sometimes every thing gets into the same mood; how to define this one I donâ€™t knowâ€”It was gay, & yet terrible & fearfully vivid. Nowadays Iâ€™m often overcome by London; even think of the dead who have walked in the city. Perhaps one might visit city the churches. The view of the grey white spires from Hungerford Bridge brings it to me: & yet I canâ€™t say what â€˜itâ€™ is.
