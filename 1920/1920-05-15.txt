### Saturday 15 May

Accurately described, today is a fine spring day, not a hot summer dayâ€”so L. & I shaded it off, walking up to the Park this afternoon. But Richmond on fine Saturdays is like a lime tree in full flowerâ€”suppose one were an insect sitting on the flower. All the others swarm & buzz, & burble. Being residents we donâ€™t, of course.

A letter from Madge this morning, asking me to review her novel: a letter from Fisher Unwin offering to give me a copy. Such is the morality of a woman who wonâ€™t pollute her sons by staying at Charleston. I meant to say how we sat on the grass above the cedars & watched the deer; how I noticed the semi-transparent beauty of a parasol in the sunâ€”how the air has this tenderness now that coloured dresses seem to glow in it. A long flattering review of me in the Nation, wiping out Massinghamâ€™s bitterness, & giving me my first taste of intelligent criticism, so Iâ€™m set upâ€”even contemplate thanking the writer.

Flora & George dined here last night, ostensibly to discuss Clara, really to tell us the simple fact that sheâ€™s going to America, & may stay there permanently. Can one imagine anything less desirable than to be a person who may stay permanently in Americaâ€”& its hoped she does. The slightness of human relations often appals me. One doesnâ€™t mind in the least whether she disappears for ever. This doesnâ€™t apply to everyone I admit. Iâ€™m a little fidgety because Nessa hasnâ€™t rung me upâ€”probably she came back last night. I liked George more than I expected. A sandy salty looking youth, unambitious, lean, humorous, decided, content to be a schoolmaster for ever, so long as he doesnâ€™t become headmaster. He talked about Sussex, the small owls, & the long eared owls; also the war; he was through it all; never wounded, & saw Damascus. He said the men are very unselfish but boring, because they can talk on so few subjects. How nice, I often think, normal people are!
