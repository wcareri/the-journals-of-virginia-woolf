### Monday 25 October (first day of winter time)

Why is life so tragic; so like a little strip of pavement over an abyss. I look down; I feel giddy; I wonder how I am ever to walk to the end. But why do I feel this? Now that I say it I donâ€™t feel it. The fire burns; we are going to hear the Beggars Opera. Only it lies about me; I canâ€™t keep my eyes shut. Itâ€™s a feeling of impotence: of cutting no ice. Here I sit at Richmond, & like a lantern stood in the middle of a field my light goes up in darkness. Melancholy diminishes as I write. Why then donâ€™t I write it down oftener? Well, oneâ€™s vanity forbids. I want to appear a success even to myself. Yet I dont get to the bottom of it. Its having no children, living away from friends, failing to write well, spending too much on food, growing oldâ€”I think too much of whys & wherefores: too much of myself. I dont like time to flap round me. Well then, work. Yes, but I so soon tire of workâ€”canâ€™t read more than a little, an hourâ€™s writing is enough for me. Out here no one comes in to waste time pleasantly. If they do, Iâ€™m cross. The labour of going to London is too great. Nessaâ€™s children grow up, & I cant have them in to tea, or go to the Zoo. Pocket money doesnâ€™t allow of much. Yet Iâ€™m persuaded that these are trivial things: its life itself, I think sometimes, for us in our generation so tragicâ€”no newspaper placard without its shriek of agony from some one. McSwiney this afternoon & violence in Ireland; or itâ€™ll be the strike. Unhappiness is everywhere; just beyond the door; or stupidity which is worse. Still I dont pluck the nettle out of me. To write Jacobâ€™s Room again will revive my fibres, I feel. Evelyn is done: but I donâ€™t like what I write now. And with it all how happy I amâ€”if it werenâ€™t for my feeling that its a strip of pavement over an abyss.
