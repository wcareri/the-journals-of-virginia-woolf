### Sunday 12 December

Nearing the end of the year. Everything muffled in snow & crisp with frost; streets knobbed & slippery; hands grimy as cold for some reason always makes them. Here we sit over the fire, expecting Rogerâ€”whose book is out; as everyoneâ€™s book is outâ€”Katherineâ€™s, Murryâ€™s, Eliotâ€™s. None have I read so far. I was happy to hear K. abused the other night. Now why? Partly some obscure feeling that she advertises herself; or Murry does it for her; & then how bad the Athenaeum stories are; yet in my heart I must think her good, since Iâ€™m glad to hear her abused.

Scenes now come to mind. Gordon Square at tea timeâ€”All those branches twisting themselves so fluently, like the Laocoon; so I saw them from Ralphâ€™s upper room. Then thereâ€™s Lytton coming round to tea. At once we plunge, even on the cold pavement, into literature. Eliotâ€™s bookâ€”â€œseriousâ€ far far better than the journalistsâ€”disgraceful review by Lynd. â€œStill heâ€™s cut & driedâ€”leaves cutâ€”donâ€™t like Milton.â€â€”Shall Lytton write to the Nation? What about Vic? So we pace to Nessaâ€™s door. And Ralph? Well, I wdnâ€™t marry Ralphâ€”A despot. True. But whats to happen to C. She canâ€™t live indefinitely with meâ€”Perhaps with him? Door opens, in I go; up I go; children there; sit over the stove; Nessa draws pictures for Angelica. And home again.

Molly Hamilton next. Iâ€™m enlarging my sphere, not very widely, but I take pains to accept whatâ€™s offered. When accepted, I feel that I must make the most. Itâ€™s not for nothing that I go out to tea. So there we sit, scratching on the match box. â€œIâ€™m assistant editor to the Review of Reviewsâ€”at a salary of Â£570!â€ she cried. And so her mother can live in London; & sheâ€™s launched; poor Molly can do all this by chaining herself to the desk. There the desk was & books laid out as you see them in shops. Did the match burst into flame? Yes, I think so, about happiness, & human beings. I try not to think whether Iâ€™m liked for saying things, or what impression I make, only whether I think the things I say. But with another human being this is very difficultâ€”so susceptible am I, so vain. The poetess came inâ€”poor hard boiled egg, duckâ€™s egg; going to dine at the Club, taking herself off.

I forget my first view of Molly, going down the Strand the night of the Cenotaph; such a lurid scene, like one in Hell. A soundless street; no traffic; but people marching. Clear, cold, & windless. A bright light in the Strand; women crying Remember the Glorious Dead, & holding out chrysanthemums. Always the sound of feet on the pavement. Faces bright & luridâ€”poor M.â€™s worn enough by that illumination. I touched her arm; whereupon she jumped, like some one woken. A ghastly procession of people in their sleep.
