### Tuesday 6 July

Too much to write as usual, but we work like navvies at binding Morgan, & have no time for frivolity. Festivities get wedged in where convenient. All this comes of choosing a paper that has to be enforced with a lining. It looks as though Morgan might boom, though I dont, as a critic, see altogether what the reason is. And am I a critic? Take Conradâ€™s book. We were at the first Athenaeum lunchâ€”a long single file of insignificant brain workers eating bad courses. Katherine was opposite, & I heard her enthusiastically praising this very book. At last, appealed to, I confessed my perversity, whereupon she hedgedâ€”so did I. But which is right? I still maintain that Iâ€™m the true seer, the one independent voice in a chorus of obedient sheep, since they praise unanimously. They always begin that when the plays overâ€”thats my view at least. This lunch was a little dingy & professional, a glimpse into the scullery where the Sullivans & Pounds & Murrys & Huxleys stand stripped with their arms in wash tubs. I see the obvious retort; yet I canâ€™t rid myself of the feeling that if Lytton, Roger, Desmond, Morgan, Nessa, & Duncan had been there the atmosphere would have been less of the area steps & more of the open air. But Iâ€™m rather acid about Murry, on account of his writing I think, & Heaven knows, a story by Katherine always manages to put my teeth on edge. My storyâ€™s outâ€”hailed by Sydney & Mrs Schiffâ€”its odd how oneâ€™s private circle ceases to attend to these outbursts, & how if praise or blame comes its from the public now. Julian here for the week end; & the weather such constant rain as seldom happens; now & then a torrent that sets streams running in 5 minutes.
