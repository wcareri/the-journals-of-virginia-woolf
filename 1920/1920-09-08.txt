### Wednesday 8 September

Perhaps a little authorâ€™s egotism may be allowedâ€”simply that Iâ€™ve taken the plunge of refusing my books from the Times, & dictated conditions for the futureâ€”only leading articles, or those I suggest myself. No answer from Richmond, so I donâ€™t know his view of it. But, of course, far from being rejected he was respecting my holiday, & suggested a list of victims, Murry & Lawrence among them, at the thought of which I shivered & shuddered, & finally decided to run the risk. At this moment I feel it more of a risk than the day before yesterday, as Lytton, Mary, Clive, came here yesterday, discussed immortality; & I find my bid for it is as letter writer. What about poor Jacob then? & hadnâ€™t I better drive my pen through sheets that pay of a morning, in the intervals of writing letters? Oh vanity, vanity! how it grows on meâ€”how detestable it isâ€”how I swear to crush it outâ€”Learn French is the only thing I can think of. Then I didnâ€™t like Mary; scented, tinted, lewd lipped, & blear eyed; & the consciousness that its the mean side of me that feasts on such garbage; & resentment with her for making me feed on garbage; & she saying sharp things & then hard, & I unable to say out loud â€œWell then, why come & sit on my lawn?â€ Why does she? And I always break off â€˜poor wretchâ€™â€”yet not quite magnanimously in her case. L. at tea put me right: M.H. is one of the few people I dislike, I said. No: he replied: one of the many you dislike & like alternatelyâ€”The bread had not risenâ€”I was worried this morning by school children; & I hate people to compare this to the disadvantage of Ashehamâ€”M.H. again. Lytton gave me a lesson in simplicity. If anyone has a right to talk of immortality he has with his 9 editions & so on. Yet when L. severely told him he had no chance of that, he did not narrow his eyes, shift his hands, or do anything but look calm & animated. It was an amusing talk. How far has our set justified its promise? Lytton maintains that in ourselves we are as remarkable as the Johnson set, though our works may perishâ€”still weâ€™re still at the beginning of our works. Then came that about Madame de SevignÃ©: then Duncan given his chance; I compared Eâ minent Victoriansâ€™s with Macaulay, & thought Lytton perhaps uncertain about Victoria. Maynard says, however, it should succeed better; indeed is better. Much talk of Athenaeum; Lady Blessington; our printing prospects; before they went. Lytton comes on Friday. After all, isnâ€™t he the choicest of us? And now I can go out & look at the downsâ€”where?
