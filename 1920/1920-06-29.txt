### Tuesday 29 June

Back from Rodmell, which was disappointing, as if held to our lips the cup of pleasure was dashed from them. We started by cutting down the laurel hedge, enthusiastically, clearing a view of the downs. Next morning L.â€™s arm was bad again, & so it continued, swollen & irritable, rasping every moment that should have been so delicious. The weather brooded heavy too. One day was consumed by Saxon & Barbara. Poor Barbara has the prominent nose & fixed lines of premature maturity. Such a grind & a drudge her life is as fills me with pityâ€”seeing human life a thing to be put through the machine by necessity. For she seemed to have no choice. First Nick, then the childâ€”& all her lines laid down for her for life, by the hand of fate, for she canâ€™t leap them. There she treads her road. Our generation is daily scourged by the bloody war. Even I scribble reviews instead of novels because of the thick skulls at Westminster & Berlin. Saxon was airy & sprightly. The kitchen a success I think, but then Iâ€™m not a cook. Home yesterday, to find Lottie with her exaggerated forebodingsâ€”Nelly taken worse, & so on, all in an alarmist strain, until having secured her sensation she condescended to details which are not very alarming. But the poor wretches seek to protect themselves from faultfinding by so many prevarications that the truth always cowers close to the ground.

Dinner with Nessa last night. My attemptâ s at sensation were overshadowed by her really great & surprising oneâ€”nothing less than the death of a young man at Mrs Russellâ€™s dance. They sat out on the roof, protected by fairy lamps & chairs. He crossed, perhaps to light a cigarette, stepped over the edge, & fell 30 feet onto flagstones. Adrian alone saw the thing happen. He called a doctor sitting there, & very calmly & bravely, so Nessa felt, climbed the wall into the garden where the man had fallen, & helped the Dr over. But there was no hope. He died in the ambulance that fetched him. The dance was stopped. Nessa says the younger generation is callous. No one was upset; some telephoned for news of other dances. Aunt Lou bungled everything with her salt American cheerfulness. It was odd how, sitting high up, one began to get a sense of falling. The man was called Wright, aged 21: for some reason he had his birth certificate on him. Only the girl who brought him knew him. The parents, rich country people, come up, were shown the spot & had nothing to say except, â€˜That was where he fellâ€™â€”but what could they say? Aunt Lou gave her version of the thing â€˜not a tragedyâ€”not in the least a tragedyâ€”a stepmother only & seven other childrenâ€”& its over for him poor boy.â€™ A strange eventâ€”to come to a dance among strangers & dieâ€”to come dressed in evening clothes, & then for it all to be over, instantly, so senselessly. Pippa had warned them. No brandy was to be had in any of the three houses.
