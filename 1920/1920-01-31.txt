### Saturday 31 January

Here is my calendar: Tuesday the Squires & Wilkinson & Edgar to dinner; Wednesday tea with Elena; Thursday lunch with Nessa, tea Gordon Square; Friday Clive & Mary here; & Saturday sitting over the fire with a morbid & I hope unfounded fear lest certain creatures infesting Lottie & Nelly may begin to twitter beneath my skin. An incident of this sort is like the blackness that used to cross the waves in the bay & make my heart sink when I sat doing lessons at the long table in St Ives drawing room. Sordidâ€”cheapâ€”And the impression was enforced by a visit to Putney. The streets of villas make me more dismal than slums. Each has a cropped tree growing out of a square lifted from the pavement in front of it. Then the interiorsâ€”But I dont want to dwell on this. As Leonard said, its the soul of Sylvia in stucco. They were sitting in the dining room with a large table, reading novelsâ€”Its partly that Iâ€™m a snob. The middle classes are cut so thick, & ring so coarse, when they laugh or express themselves. The lower classes donâ€™t do this at all.

It is said that Mr Wilkinson was nearly drunk; that excuse canâ€™t serve Mrs Squire though; she has spread more widely; is even more settled into a kind of whitish sediment; a sort of indecency to me in her passive gloating contentment in the arm chair opposite; like some natural function, performing automaticallyâ€”a jelly fishâ€”without volition, yet with terrifying potentiality. She breaks off into young on the least provocation: Squire is at least direct & honest. I donâ€™t like it when he talks about love patriotism & paternity, but on the other hand I can speak my mind to him. Love came into the discussion on account of the Athenaeum. According to Squire the A. denies everything. It is a frost of death for all creative activity. Now the London Mercury provides a very fertile soil. He pressed me to write for the London Mercury. The A. is winning itself a bad name, on account of its hard sceptical tone. I tried to explain to Squire that there is such a thing as honesty & a high standard; his retort is & there are such things as poetry & enthusiasm. At present the battle in our circles is between James & Desmond. James wishes to â€˜stab humbug deadâ€™. Desmond & I wish, on the contrary, to revive it like a phoenix from its ashes. The difference is fundamental; but I am equally able to write for Murry, Squire or Desmondâ€”a proof of catholicity or immorality, according to your taste.

But with us its a question of drains. We are in for a spell of bad luck & find ourselves compelled to spend Â£200 perhaps on drains, which, six months ago, would have been Mrs Brewerâ€™s concern. Still, we had fears for a thousand.

At tea with Elena, in the absence of Bruce Richmond, we broached, delicately, the subject of the Times Literary Supplement. She said that people were nice to her in order to influence reviews. She said they made Bruceâ€™s life a burden to him. I lightly sketched my interview with Mrs Clifford. It was all known to her, I could see; she knew Mrs Cliffordâ€™s methods. She dines with Lady Dilke, & hears her japes with Stephen McKenna. I liked Elena for sharing my feeling of repulsion; indeed she is more clearminded & innocent than I am, & regards it through the simple brown eyes of the nicest, most modest, of collie dogs. I liked her better than before, & she sat on a stool, & told me how she does this that & the other for the diseased & the afflicted, & I thought she must be a pleasant sight at a bedside. People who have no brilliance or subtlety seem to take things in directly & sanely in such a way as to abash me, who count myself among the brilliant. There they are, it seems, without exertion or self applause: nor are they much deceived by brilliance. The rest I must skip, since I have 6 biographies to read for Desmond. A letter from a Mr Askew in Staffordshire about N. & D. pleasant; & odd to please the lower classes.
