### Tuesday 23 November

We see too many people for me to describe them, had I the time. I have lived the past 2 weeks methodically, printing till dark, allowing myself a day off, arranging things rather successfully; so my strip of pavement (I bag that phrase for Jacob) widens. O but Ive quarrelled with Nessa & Duncan! Iâ€™m standing on my dignity. They choose to tell me liesâ€”very well, I donâ€™t go near them till Iâ€™m asked. Will they notice? Not in all that shindy of children &c: but Iâ€™m cheerful & composed, & conscious of the immense value of my visits. Hope has been for the weekendâ€”over-dressed, over elaborate, scented, extravagant, yet with thick nose, thick ankles; a little unrefined, I mean. That is I like her very much & think her very clever; but I donâ€™t like women who are vain & lacking in self-confidence at the same time. It is easily explicableâ€”the rich uncultivated father, brother a trim officer; wealth; health; Jane superimposed, & the greed, like a greed for almond paste, for fame. We talked very well together all the same; & I did my writing (a review of Lawrence sprung upon me) all the same. Why do I dislike unbalanced criticism so muchâ€”silliness about Edith Sitwell & Fredegond? As when Ottoline loads her mantelpiece with knick knacks. Old Gumbo in her brown overcoat, spontaneous & emphatic showed up very well beside her. But Iâ€™m exaggerating her defects. She is clever & subtle, & if she hasnâ€™t much generosity, Iâ€™m not sure that clever people always have.

Then yesterday came Bob for tea, uneasy like a dog who has been roundly beaten for stealing from a butcherâ€™s shop, at coming uninvited, & offering to go & leave us to work every 10 minutes. Then we got on to the Poetic Drama & he owned to having begun a new one three days ago. His arguments about the need of writing classical drama, not modern drama, evidently long in use; & I thoughtlessly asked him to write proseâ [.] â€œI might as well ask you to write poetry!â€ he said. Indeed it was unkind. Still he showed up less angular & more considerate & mellow than usual, though L. detected pain in his eyeâ€”the legacy of Gladys Deacon perhaps. I like him for praising other writers so unthinkinglyâ€”without regard that is to his own position. He praised Eliotâ€™s criticism, which had, he said, taken away his own confidence in the poetic drama. I doubt not that under the larches of Leith Hill that will flourish again. The most amusing of his refrains was about Norton. To hear Bob sigh & tread delicately like a hippopotamus holding its breath one would suppose Norton suicidal & maniac. The truth seems to be â€˜but you must discount what I sayâ€”its very difficult to know what impression Iâ€™m givingâ€”yet one must say something to his friends; & I think its going to be all right now; if we can get over the next few weeksâ€”â€™ The truth is that he has given up mathematics ostensibly on Craigâ€™s advice, feels humiliated, & darenâ€™t face his friends, poor devil, Gordon Square that is. I think I can trace the crisis far back; his powers proving not quite what he thought; worry; strain; despondency; envisaging failure; thought of boasting; dread of being ridiculousâ€”all that, & then his appearance against him with young women, morbid about sex, which clearly isnâ€™t his strong line; culminating in a kind of breakdown on the motherly housemaidâ€™s knee of good Bessy. There he sticks, afraid to issue out, without prospects, a man who has trusted entirely in intellect, & taken his cue from that, given to despising, rejecting, & tacitly claiming an exalted rank on the strength of mathematics which cant be done, & never could be done, I expect. (I quote Maynard) Such an egotist too; never able to see any other face save his own; & worrying out such laborious relationships always bâ etwâ een himself & other people. Now, poor creature, for I pity him & know his case from my own past, he translates stories from the French, & a book said to want doing by Ponsonby. I can imagine the kind of humility that must be on him, & how he gropes this winter, for some possible method in the future. And hereâ€™s L. & I canâ€™t go on about the Memoir Club!
