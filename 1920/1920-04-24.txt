### Saturday 24 April

Half blind with writing notices, & corrections in 160 copies of Paris, a Poem, by Hope Mirrlees. Then Iâ€™ve read some Berkeley, whom I much admire, & would like to catch the trick in his styleâ€”only I fear its thinking. Reading Maynard tooâ€”a book that influences the world without being in the least a work of art: a work of morality, I suppose. Morgan came for a night. Very easy going; as sensitive as a blue butterfly. So I was pleased to write in his birthday book which is one of his tests of niceness. And heâ€™s obstinate about â€˜nicenessâ€™â€”much of a puritan. Tells the truth. I wish I could write his talk down.

I must now write a postcard. Yes, I must really catch the first post if possible. Iâ€™ll take it myselfâ€”Is there time stillâ€”Iâ€™ll tell you what it is. The seat is being painted. The boy is so stupid heâ€™ll paint it after its been rained upon. Then it will be ruined.

Nonsense said L. it wont hurt it.  
But are you sure? Positive.  
Oh then Iâ€™ll let it aloneâ€”if youâ€™re quite sure. My mother is having the seat painted green. She wouldnâ€™t let me do it, & the boy is dreadfully stupid. I found him putting on the paint without having scraped the old paint off first. &c â€¦

This is very like Morgan; so too his reliance on Leonard. â€œWhere dâ€™you get your boots? Are Waterman pens the best.â€
