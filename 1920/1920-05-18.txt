Gordon Square begins again & like a snake renews its skin outwornâ€”thatâ€™s the nearest I can come to a quotation. Gordon Square differentâ€”like a looking glass version of 46. You are let in, by a strange servant, go up bare steps, hear children crying at various stages, go up & upâ€”till you reach what is, in the real Gordon Square, servants bedroomsâ€”Thereâ€™s an open door to be passed first, though, & Sophie inside, & one who, beneath a weight of flesh & bone proved to have the body of Annie Chart in her. Nessa is right at the top. Well we talked till I left at 8; interrupted though by Lytton, Angelica, & Julian. When Stella came back from Italy there were always a great many presents. So now I was given a hat, a brooch, & paper. Lytton said that James & Alix are to be married in 3 weeks. So after all, she has won. But though satisfactory, I find no excitement in this. They know each other too well to stir oneâ€™s imagination thinking of their future, as one does with most engagements. Then, talk talk; & as we were despatching the superficial & reaching the easy-intimate, I had to tear off, in the rain, to Wigmore Hall. Sat between Oliver & Saxon; & these musical people dont listen as I do, but critically, superciliously, without programmes.

Today Campbell has been to lunch. Told stories of Palestine. I like thinking I hear men speaking alone. How his general taught him to ride. â€œNo need to say elk elkâ€”youâ€™re not talking to a canary.â€ C. dresses like a gentleman, & L. could say to him that he believed nothing without making him deny it. Little romance about the church: then I donâ€™t see how they go through with it. How get through the service?â€”for you canâ€™t gibe at God as one does at an editorâ€”The worst of it must be that thereâ€™s no shop about Godâ€”I suppose not at least. Logan came on Sunday, & amused me for an hour. Told us about Christ, & his travelsâ€”but if youâ€™re not amused by Logan, youâ€™re irritated. So, alas, we begin to find; since his book flags & we run risk of losing money by it. A bad review in the Times, another in Athenaeum; no rush of orders. Hope dribbles along, but she is a negligeable matter.
