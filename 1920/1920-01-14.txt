### Wednesday 14 January

On Sunday the Shoves dined here; Monday nothing; Tuesday Club & talk, almost of an intimate kind, with Gumbo; Bob. T., Fredegond, Alix, the background; Wednesday is the present moment, in from a snatched walk at Kew, awaiting Leonard, & expecting a large party, Doggats, Joshuaâ€™s &c. at 7.30. So I write as if waiting for a train. I might fill this page & the succeeding ones with the Shovesâ€™ gossip, but I have never determined how far it is permitted to go here in indiscretion. I should have to write at length to retail this specimen properly which is the conclusive reason against it. But it referred to the three days of revelation at Garsington; there was a flush of confession it seems, poured into Fredegondâ€™s ear. It shows how little one knows oneâ€™s kind. I should never have expected long fatuous Philip in his leather gaiters, double breasted waistcoat & jewelled buttons to go those lengths. According to Gerald, the general feeling roused in one was pityâ€”such a lonely, in some ways unhappy man. I canâ€™t help smiling at the thought of these semi-ducal, (demi-semi at most, I admit) children playing in the suburbs of Ealing & Streatham, living to be insurance clerks or the like, while Garsington lacks an heir. There! The catâ€™s out of the bag.

My intimacy with Gumbo came on the flood tide of her appreciation of N. & D. â€œSo solidâ€”so largeâ€”such a greatâ€”firm buildingâ€â€”â€œIt belongs to literatureâ€”an addition to lifeâ€. Such sentiments warm one to people. Apart from them, as I think this diary records, I have warmed to her these past years, guessing at a good deal of dreariness, & half expecting that the old light would never blaze again. Now it begins to flicker & that is the origin of her novel. I wonder, parenthetically, whether I too, deal thus openly in autobiography & call it fiction?â€”Her story is the story of M.S. & J.W. & the conclusion is that she regains happiness, though losing the object. My brain at once spins to clothe her story for her,â€”how happiness is to be represented by a green here; a yellow there & so on. (novelist or not, some instinct of story telling is pretty quick in me). She is to send me her chapters.

Leonardâ€™s book is out today. To judge by his calm, you would not think it. Great gales in the way of weather; a French ship sunk in the Bay of Biscay, two days after Bella must have passed through; a Cornish steamer wrecked too off Swanage; & on our windows such a battering at night that we woke twice. Violent gusts leaping out of the heart of complete calmâ€”a suggestion of animal savagery; or human frenzy. But what with glass & brick we human beings do pretty well. I sometimes think with wonder that soon the immense thickness & stability of Hogarth House will be mine to whittle away with a penknife, should I so choose. And hereâ€”thank goodnessâ€”is L.
