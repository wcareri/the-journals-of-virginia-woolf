### Saturday 8 May

Massingham has postponed seeing L. which may mean that thereâ€™s some obstacle. Thinking it over, I shouldnâ€™t be sorry if it fell through; for I cant help suspecting that work of this kind means more of a tie than any moneyâ€”all the gold of Peru poured into my lap as Miss Mitford saysâ€”could repay. Besides, why should I slip the collar round his neck & myself spring free? Partly owing to Lytton, partly to the horror of writing 1, 2, 3, 4, reviews on end, 3 concerning Mitford too, Iâ€™ve been groaning & grumbling, & seeing myself caged, & all my desired endsâ€”Jacobâ€™s Room that isâ€”vanishing down avenues. But 1 review weekly wonâ€™t hurt.

On Wednesday, Walter, Adrian & Karin, & Molly Hamilton dined here. A chattering random vivacious evening: I cant remember any scrap of dialogue though. Perhaps with Molly & Karin thatâ€™s inevitable: Karin deaf of the ears, Molly a little obtuse in the senses. I observe that she scrupulously makes conversation to fill silences with; even though sheâ€™s nothing to say. Odd to me that life should require â€˜professional womenâ€™. She is reading 500 novels, at 5/- each, for a prize competition; & had a batch of sickly stuff to masticate in the train going home. We discussed politics, A. & I trying to make her define her position; which is visionary. She is bored by the means, but believes in the end. I suppose sheâ€™ll be Hamilton M.P. one of these days; but the elections go badly for women, & Labour fights shy of them.

Yesterday I had tea with Saxon at the Club; &, remembering old lonely evenings of my own, when the married couple seemed so secure & lamplit, asked him back to dinner. I wonder though whether his loneliness ever frightens him as mine used to frighten me. I daresay office work is a great preservative.
