### Monday 31 May

Back from Monkâ€™s an hour ago, after the first week endâ€”the most perfect, I was going to say, but how can I tell what week ends we maynâ€™t spend there? The first pure joy of the garden I mean. Wind enough outside; within sunny & sheltered; & weeding all day to finish the beds in a queer sort of enthusiasm which made me say this is happiness. Gladioli standing in troops: the mock orange out. Kitchen wall battered down. We were out till 9 at night, though the evening was cold. Both stiff & scratched all over today; with chocolate earth in our nails. Then the halt has started again; we went into Lewes for the first time since the war. Gunn rode across the level crossing with his great bob tailed dog. The Thomases were on the platform: poor little draggle tail sisters, scarcely holding to their ladyhood any longer. Thomas affable & kindly to the men, telling them, in a sermonical voice, about the water spout at Louth. â€œVery se-e-erious, many lives lost, & a quarter of a million damageâ€, as if to conciliate them; no teeth in his upper jaw. Gunn cantered through the water meadows, his mare â€˜very clever at the gates, but she wonâ€™t stand stillâ€™ as the Miss T.â€™s said, these things interesting them more than water spouts.

I had my interview with K.M. on Friday. A steady discomposing formality & coldness at first. Enquiries about house & so on. No pleasure or excitement at seeing me. It struck me that she is of the cat kind: alien, composed, always solitary & observant. And then we talked about solitude, & I found her expressing my feelings, as I never heard them expressed. Whereupon we fell into step, & as usual, talked as easily as though 8 months were minutesâ€”till Murry came in with a pair of blue & pink Dresden candle pieces: â€œHow very niceâ€ she said. â€œBut do fetch the candles.â€ â€œVirginia, how awful what am I to say? He has spent Â£5 on themâ€ she said, as he left the room. I see that theyâ€™re often hostile. For one thingâ€”Murryâ€™s writing. â€œDid you like C. & A.?â€ No, I didnâ€™t. â€œNeither did I. But I thought D. of an I. too dreadfulâ€”wrongâ€”Its very very difficult, oftenâ€¦â€ Then Murry came back. We chatted as usual. Aldous was our butt. Aldous has brought out Leda: will the public canonise him too? But Murry going at length, K. & I once more got upon literature. Question of her stories. This last one, Man without a T., is her first in the new manner. She says sheâ€™s mastered somethingâ€”is beginning to do what she wants. Prelude a coloured post card. Her reviews mere scribbling without a serious thought in them. And Sullivanâ€™s praise in the Aâ thenaeum detestable to her. A queer effect she produces of someone apart, entirely self-centred; altogether concentrated upon her â€˜artâ€™: almost fierce to me about it, I pretending I couldnâ€™t write. â€œWhat else is there to do? We have got to do it. Lifeâ€”â€ then how she tells herself stories at night about all the lives in a town. â€œIts a spring night. I go down to the docksâ€”I hear the travellers sayâ€”â€ acting it in her usual way, & improvising. Then asked me to write stories for the A. â€œBut I donâ€™t know that I can write storiesâ€ I said, honestly enough, thinking that in her view, after her review of me, anyhow, those were her secret sentiments. Whereupon she turned on me, & said no one else could write stories except meâ€”Kew the right â€˜gestureâ€™; a turning pointâ€”Well but Night & Day? I said, though I hadnâ€™t meant to speak of it.

â€˜An amazing achievementâ€™ she said. Why, weâ€™ve not had such a thing since I donâ€™t know whenâ€”,

But I thought you didnâ€™t like it?

Then she said she could pass an examination in it. Would I come & talk about itâ€”lunchâ€”so Iâ€™m going to lunch; but what does her reviewing mean then?â€”or is she emotional with me? Anyhow, once more as keenly as ever I feel a common certain understanding between usâ€”a queer sense of being â€˜likeâ€™â€”not only about literatureâ€”& I think itâ€™s independent of gratified vanity. I can talk straight out to her.
