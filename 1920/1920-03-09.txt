### Tuesday 9 March

In spite of some tremors, I think I shall go on with this diary for the present. I sometimes think that I have worked through the layer of style which suited itâ€”suited the comfortable bright hour after tea; & the thing Iâ€™ve reached now is less pliable. Never mind: I fancy old Virginia, putting on her spectacles to read of March 1920 will decidedly wish me to continue. Greetings! my dear ghost; & take heed that I dont think 50 a very great age. Several good books can be written still; & hereâ€™s the bricks for a fine one.

To return to the present owner of the name: on Sunday I went up to Campden Hill to hear the Sâ chubert quintetâ€”to see George Boothâ€™s houseâ€”to take notes for my storyâ€”to rub shoulders with respectabilityâ€”all these reasons took me there, & were cheaply gratified at 7/6.

Whether people see their own rooms with the devastating clearness that I see them, thus admitted once for one hour, I doubt. Chill superficial seemliness; but thin as a March glaze of ice on a pool. A sort of mercantile smugness. Horsehair & mahogany is the truth of it; & the white panels, Vermeer reproductions, omega table & variegated curtains rather a snobbish disguise. The least interesting of rooms: the compromise; though of course, thats interesting too. I took against the family system. Old Mrs Booth enthroned on a sort of commode in widows dress: flanked by devoted daughters; with grandchildren somehow symbolical cherubs. Such neat dull little boys & girls. There we all sat in our furs & white gloves. Elena asked us to dine: I (perhaps for this reason) exempt her & Bruce from this censure.

Monday at the Club, which I see Iâ€™ve ceased to describe. Alix; Bunny, Birrell; James; finally Morgan. Alix told me that Florence Darwinâ€”still I call her Maitlandâ€”is dead. For a moment I was shocked. Then it seemed to me that her greatest happiness had been with Fred; then I pitied poor old Frank, left for the 3rd time alone. Then an attempt to remember her which I can do rather accurately: the beautiful brown eyes, with the defiant look in them; the brown hair; the colour; the emphatic manner; the exaggeration of her talkâ€”reminding me a little of motherâ€”indeed the manner was much motherâ€™s. Always simply dressed in black, I think; & holding herself superblyâ€”in the sense of proudly, tensely; nerves much on edge; but showing so to us only in her dramatic ways; quick movements; beautiful turns & glances, as she protestedâ€”Fred treating her with a kind of bantering courtesy, & amusement; which I felt was the cover of a deep understanding between them not unveiled before us. I went one evening into his study to speak to him; opened the door & stood for a second silent; he raised his eyes, thought for a moment that I was Florence, whereupon he looked tender & intimate as I had never seen himâ€”which look of course vanished directly he recognised me. If I now heard that this letter of Fredegondâ€™s was untrue, I should try to see her again. But what is it that prevents one from ever seeing people, when years have passed, & there have been deaths & births & marriages?
