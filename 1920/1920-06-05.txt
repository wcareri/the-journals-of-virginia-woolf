### Saturday 5 June

Here we are in the prime of the year which Iâ€™ve thought of so often in January & December, always with pleasure; so that even if Juneâ€™s bad, one has had more pleasure from it than from all the other months. Is that cynical? What I believe is that one brings out the taste of the month oneâ€™s in by opposing to it another. But to think of December now gives me no pleasure. Iâ€™ve gone back into winter clothes; its bitter windy; & the sun sparks & glints instead of burning. It burnt on Derby day though â€”the day I lunched with K.M. & had 2 hours priceless talkâ€”priceless in the sense that to no one else can I talk in the same disembodied way about writing; without altering my thought more than I alter it in writing here. (I except L. from this). We talked about books, writing of course: my own. N. & D. a first rate novel, she said. The suppression in it puzzling, but accounted for by circumstances. Then I said â€˜Youâ€™ve changed. Got through something;â€™ indeed theres a sort of self command about her as if having mastered something subterfuges were no longer so necessary. She told me of her terrific experiences last winterâ€”experience of loneliness chiefly; alone (or only with â€˜Leslie Moorâ€™ alias Ida Baker) in a stone house with caverns beneath it into which the sea rushed: how she lay on bed alone all day with a pistol by her; & men banged at the door. Sydney wrote â€˜Stick it outâ€™ twice, underlined. Murry sent a balance sheet of his accounts: came at Christmas with plum pudding & curd cheese; â€˜Now Iâ€™m here, its all rightâ€™. Then she went to him for assurance; didnâ€™t get it; & will never look for that particular quality again. I see what she means, vaguely. She is nervous about her book coming out; fearing lest she hasnâ€™t done enough. What she feels exactly for fame & criticism, I donâ€™t know; but then in our perhaps too exalted talk, this is not very exactly told. Anyhow, I enjoyed myself; & this fragmentary intermittent intercourse of mine seems more fundamental than many better established ones.

I dined last night with Walter Lamb & Mrs Madan at Hounslow. In this old manor house (cream coloured & black) Miss Arnold used to lie drunk. The high rooms are mostly panelled, or papered with Chinese papers. Outside there is a square garden, all its hair flowing in the wind. It was a cold night, & poor Mrs M. crouched in one room, near the flaring grass, supported by rich volumes, apparently not reading, nor sewing, nor talking, her husband away, & the people of Hounslow vicious & hostile. A kind of echo of great luxury everywhere, as becomes the daughter of Mrs Saxton Noble. Much talk of royalties, she & W. moving in the same sphere. One Princess, Marie Louise, lodges, for months now, in Kent House, & has driven away Mr & Master Noble. She keeps royal state with a maid of honour. The atmosphere of this struck me greatly; the unreality. Then her efforts to join the Kingâ€™s private view of the R.A. Something 18th century in it; a taste of patrons & back stair intrigue. Mrs M. was a sharp shrewd unpretentious young woman, going to have a baby, entirely fed on chopped hay, I should guess, but not servile; only not happy, & never will be, I suppose, since one could detect that her husband filled no important place. They started life in this Hounslow farm 10 months ago. â€œBut what a splendid beginning for married life!â€ I said. â€œIndeed it isnâ€™t!â€ she replied. Geoffrey had gone off, & taken the key of the port. The discomfort of the third rate (W.L. that is) became acute before the evening was over; like something out of tune. Something slate grey & furtive among innocent leaves.
