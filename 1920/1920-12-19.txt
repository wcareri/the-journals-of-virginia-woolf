### Sunday 19 December

This I see will be the last page of the year, since I go to Janet tomorrow for the night; dine in London at a festival party on Tuesday night; & leave for Rodmell on Wednesday. I shanâ€™t take this book with me, though if Iâ€™m in the mood I might scribble a page to bring back. I ought to say how happy I am, since one of these pages said how unhappy I was. I canâ€™t see any reason in it. My only guess is that it has something to do with working steadily; writing things out of my head; & never having a compartment empty. That doesnâ€™t mean that I dont stuff the corners with idle moments. I gaze at the fire. I make phrasesâ€”well, thats all well known. I canâ€™t help suspecting that both Mr & Mrs Woolf slowly increase in fame. That helps to fill compartments. No doubt I like getting letters from publishers: even to be asked to preside over Mr Beresford slightly kindles me. Next year I shall be above all that. Iâ€™ve plucked out my jealousy of Katherine by writing her an insincere-sincere letter. Her books praised for a column in the Lit Supâ€”the prelude of paeans to come. I foresee editions; then the Hawthornden prize next summer. So Iâ€™ve had my little nettle growing in me, & plucked it as I say. Iâ€™ve revived my affection for her somehow, & donâ€™t mind, in fact enjoy. But Iâ€™ve not read her book.

My book seems to me rather good. L.â€™s book seems to him (so I interpret) rather good. I am entreated to write for the T.L.S. True, Iâ€™m not asked to write for the Dial. Lytton is. Lytton dined here the other night; tired, wearied, by C. & P. I suspect, out every night at Gordon Square & pretending doubts about Vic. We discussed Nortonâ€™s case. L. very loyal to Apostles in distress, & refusing my irreverent analysis. We talk of going to Italy together. Then there was Roger, on a bitter cold night, but we stoked up, & Iâ€™ve been given his book Vision and Designâ€”a sumptuous bookâ€”in return for writing 200 addresses. I think it reads rudimentary compared with Coleridge. Fancy reforming poetry by discovering something scientific about the composition of light!

Then, characteristically, he deposited a bed, bookcases & stained glass windows in our hall; the glass, of course, broken. I observe that Iâ€™m soon muzzled; & my depredations in the herd instantly punished. Indeed, Nessa wouldnâ€™t have me living next door for something. Indeed, my retort is, I wouldnâ€™t live there. I see myself now taking my own line apart from theirs. One of these days I shanâ€™t know Clive if I meet him. I want to know all sorts of other peopleâ€”retaining only Nessa & Duncan, I think.

The Olivers dined here; Ray sitting impassive in the arm chair, rotund, massive, a little surly, in the style of Widow Creighton. Oliver discussed music. She disapproves of abstract questions in a world where there are so many concrete ones. When she dines out she relaxes. A strange lifeâ€”to believe in that division between reality & unreality. So we reach the end of the year; which is for us cheerful, I think. For one thing we want to get to Rodmell; to see what has happened to the garden. I shall like a soft grey walk. Then the post. Then reading. Then sitting in the chimney corner. I shall walk out on the flats. We take the servants & ensure comfort, for by contriving it, weâ€™re now on the best of terms with them. Left to myself I should invite people down.â€”then probably regret it. But this is dawdling & ramblingâ€”never mindâ€”this poor book must take what it can get & be thankful. (I use my new blotter, just given me by L. for the first time.)
