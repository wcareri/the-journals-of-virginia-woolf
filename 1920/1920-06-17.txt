### Thursday 17 June

Today is Cup day at Ascot; which I think marks the highest tide of the finest societies greatest seasonâ€”all superlatives that mean little to meâ€”save as I catch the hum of wheels in Piccadilly on a fine afternoon, & passing carriages look in & see powdered faces like jewels in glass cases. One must be young to feel the stir of it. We are on the road to Ascot. Open taxis go past; or motor cars like engines on the Great Western Railway. Yet the fine weather gives us too our sudden acceleration: dinner parties; memoir club; invitations; coming one on top of another. And now I cannot describe Mrs Mirrlees, & my dinner at the Rubens Hotel, in the heart of a rich warm hearted British family, untouched in any way since 100 years ago. Civilisation having produced that organism, stereotyped it. Booths are of the same species. I wonder whether its natural for families to keep together. I didnâ€™t wonder, though, that night. Unlimited silver flowed out of Sneezerâ€™s pockets.

Next day I lunched at Gordon Sqre for Rogerâ€™s show: got stuffed in the head with wine & talk & sat there not very comfortably. A toast to Roger missed fire somewhatâ€”so, I fear, do the pictures, which fill 3 rooms garishly, as with coloured sheets of tin, not one being yet bought. Lytton & I stood in a window, & looked (at least I looked) at a woman brushing her hair, high up in some by street, & silence descended. â€œIs there enough to say?â€ Lytton asked, referring to my gay life. I said no. It scarcely went round. Then he told me how he lived for ambition; he wants influence not fame; not Maynardâ€™s influence, but the influence of some old gentleman on whose 80th birthday people present addressesâ€”he wants to deal little words that poison vast monsters of falsehood. This I declared to be unattainable. But I believe it to be what he wishes. Tea at Gunters; dinner at Nessaâ€™s; & so home, a little bruised about the lips, thirsty for a great draught of solitude, which was not given me; since we dined next with the Murrys, next with Roger, & last night had the Memoir Club here, of which Iâ€™m too sleepy to give any notice. Leonard is dining with the Society, which I believe I enjoy more than he does, since I shall lie in the shallow light waiting for him; then he will come in; then I shall hear the gossip.
