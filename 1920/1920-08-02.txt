### Monday 2 August

Bank Holiday. Iâ€™m in the middle of baking a cake, & fly to this page for refuge, to fill in moments of baking & putting in my bread. Poor wretched book! Thats the way I treat you!â€”Thats the drudge you are! Still, take comfort from the thought that I brought you all the way from London, to save scribbling on half sheets which get lost. Our season ended unexpectedly; the blind falling with the light still in the sky. If I were not ashamed of my egotism, I could give a literal meaning to my metaphorâ€”seeing that I had to leave Nessaâ€™s great party at 11 in order to be home, not to disturb L., & be ready for packing & going next morning. (now for the cake). Yes, but the cake & the bread between them have made me write nothing for two daysâ€”its now Wednesday 4th, & here we are in from shrooming at Ashehamâ€”& I with so much to write (& I must keep an eye on the window to prevent Mrs Dedman from finding L. in his bath in the kitchen) that I cant begin.

Well, the great party: to me the time went in tip toe pirouettes; every minute watched, & some alas wasted. There in the corner I sat with Lady Sâ trachey. & we talked of my two grandfathers & the Indian Mutiny. She forges about a room like an unwieldy three decker, benignant, yet easily morose, hoarding some grievance against her family, like most old people, for not reading aloud to her, yet easy with strangers. Then Mr Parker the Americanâ€”alas, when praise is tracked to the source, as often as not it proves brackishâ€”& so was his. Never heard of me save through Potboilers: but my chief pirouetting was with Mary whose hand I took, held, & kissed, on the sofa with Clive on the other side of me. She said she hated & feared me. I wooed her like a wayward child. Does one speak the truth on these occasions, reach it on tiptoe from where it hangs inaccessible in less exalted moments? Then Nina Turton, flushed, lascivious, imbecile, with the heavy idiot voice, as of old, & yet interesting too, as impure women are to the pureâ€”I see her as someone in mid ocean, struggling, diving, while I pace my bank. One may console oneself though by the brainlessness of the exercise. One dip is all thatâ€™s needed. Maynard said of her that sheâ€™d had more sexual life than the rest of us put togetherâ€”saw it in her face (here came Mrs Thomsettâ€”& L. stark naked in the kitchen!).

Poor L., utterly driven for a month by Tolstoy & Morgan at last confessed to feeling tired, & was indeed on the verge of destruction. As a hobby, The Hogarth Press is clearly too lively & lusty to be carried on in this private way any longer. Moreover, the business part of it canâ€™t be shared, owing to my incompetence. The future, therefore, needs consideration. This being so, we fled a week earlier than intended, sending Nelly to recover from her vapours, & bringâ ing Lottie down here. On Monday I went up, to say good bye to K.M., was inveigled into a night at 46 & could write many pages on my reflections on sleeping in London againâ€”in Maynardâ€™s bed too. I racked my brain to think who had his room when we lived thereâ€”how many years ago? The ease & rapidity of life in London a good deal impressed meâ€”everything near at hand, to be compassed between lunch & tea, without setting out & making a job of it. Roger, Duncan, Nessa, Clive, & so on; I seeing it all much composed & in perspective owing to my outsiderâ€™s vision. K.M. asked me to review her book: I cried off on the ground that to review spoils the reading. She as quick as usual to take the point. They are coming to Eastbourne, so my farewell is deferred. Despicable as I am, I find myself liking to hear her underrated by Câ live. & Nâ essa. yet protesting as a writer; & finally harbouring one or two doubts, genuine doubts, as to the merits of her stories, since the two lately printed in the Athenaeum. have not been good.

And now I canâ€™t write my views of Don Quixote as intended, for Iâ€™ve spun my froth off, & have no wits left.
