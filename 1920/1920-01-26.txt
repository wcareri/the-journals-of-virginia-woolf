### Monday 26 January

The day after my birthday; in fact Iâ€™m 38. Well, Iâ€™ve no doubt Iâ€™m a great deal happier than I was at 28; & happier today than I was yesterday having this afternoon arrived at some idea of a new form for a new novel. Suppose one thing should open out of anotherâ€”as in An Unwritten Novelâ€”only not for 10 pages but 200 or soâ€”doesnâ€™t that give the looseness & lightness I want: doesnt that get closer & yet keep form & speed, & enclose everything, everything? My doubt is how far it will include enclose the human heartâ€”Am I sufficiently mistress of my dialogue to net it there? For I figure that the approach will be entirely different this time: no scaffolding; scarcely a brick to be seen; all crepuscular, but the heart, the passion, humour, everything as bright as fire in the mist. Then Iâ€™ll find room for so muchâ€”a gaietyâ€”an inconsequenceâ€”a light spirited stepping at my sweet will. Whether Iâ€™m sufficiently mistress of thingsâ€”thats the doubt; but conceive mark on the wall, Kâ ew. Gardens. & unwritten novel taking hands & dancing in unity. What the unity shall be I have yet to discover: the theme is a blank to me; but I see immense possibilities in the form I hit upon more or less by chance 2 weeks ago. I suppose the danger is the damned egotistical self; which ruins Joyce & Dorothy Richardson to my mind: is one pliant & rich enough to provide a wall for the book from oneself without its becoming, as in Joyce & Richardson, narrowing & restricting? My hope is that Iâ€™ve learnt my business sufficiently now to provide all sorts of entertainments. Anyhow, thereâ€™s no doubt the way lies somewhere in that direction; I must still grope & experiment but this afternoon I had a gleam of light. Indeed, I think from the ease with which Iâ€™m developing the unwritten novel there must be a path for me there.

Yesterday being my birthday & a clear bright day into the bargain showing many green & yellow flushes on the trees, I went to South Kensington & heard Mozart & Beethoven. I donâ€™t think I did hear very much of them, seated as I was between Katie & Elena, & pitched headforemost into outrageous banter of the usual kind with the Countess. But the Countess was very affable & jolly, invited me indeed insisted upon my coming, to tea with her. We turned our money under the new moon. She vibrated under the pleasure of a complimentâ€”â€œwhen Lady Cromerâ€™s there one feels &c &câ€”â€ a compliment to her beauty. But the room was clamorous with South Kensington. Eily Darwin in particular, fat & decorous & affectionate, yet plaintive as of old, as if protesting before one spoke against criticism. She told me I had been cruel. I forget now what I saidâ€”something wild & random, as everything said under those circumstances must be. George Booth took my arm & praised my book.
