I open this in order to say that I had tea with Dora at the Club & was introduced to Mr Harold Banks. Who is he? Well, all the voices of the world will thunder in reply Banks! Thats his view of it anyhow. Figure a sandy florid broad faced man; talking with an American (really Australian) accent. Shirt with black lines. A pleasant smile. Eating steadily. Dora provided bread & butter. â€˜No thank you I donâ€™t smoke â€¦â€™ â€œWhat is your plan exactly Mr Banks?â€ To tide over the revolution by the cooperation of the middle classes â€¦ Yes, but thats a little vagueâ€”A great many people wish to do that butâ€”Well Iâ€™m here to do it Mrs Sangerâ€”I donâ€™t want to talk about my Russian experiences. I want to see whether I can get the middle classes with me. If not, I go to Scotland & speak in the streetsâ€”A very good idea, Iâ€™m sureâ€”but what are you going to say? We want a change of government, Mrs Sangerâ€”So many of us feelâ€”Ah, but you English do nothing. You English & the French hold up the whole European movement. When the revolution comesâ€”And when will it come? Within 5 yearsâ€”you donâ€™t believe it?

But why not write this down? I donâ€™t believe in writing. I talk to the people. Organisation. Cooperation. Middle classes. The people. I shall do itâ€”Iâ€™m going to do it. Organisationâ€”There ought not to be a single horse in the streetsâ€”Look at your docksâ€”Then these buildings ought to be turned into homesâ€”What can we do withoutâ€”The middle classes should come togetherâ€”Iâ€™ve the programme readyâ€”& Revolution is coming without a doubt.

Why do I disbelieve in Revolutionâ€”partly because of Mr Banks perhaps.
