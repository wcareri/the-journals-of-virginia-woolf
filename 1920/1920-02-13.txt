### Friday 13 February

Again many lapses & the same excuses. For some time now life has been considerably ruffled by people. Age or fame or the return of peaceâ€”I dont know whichâ€”but anyhow I grow wearied of â€˜going out to teaâ€™; & yet cant resist it. To leave a door shut that might be open is in my eyes some form of blasphemy. That may be; meanwhile I neither write my diary nor read my Greek. There was a lunch party at the CafÃ© Royal on the day of Duncanâ€™s private view to record: 12 guests; everything handsomely done; I stimulated & fuddled with wine; a queer assortment of the usual & the unusual. There was Mrs Grant, a woman still sailing like a yatcht under the breath of mature charm; Pippa; Adrian; Bunny; Lytton. Lytton had laid out Â£70 on one of the pictures. Maynard rose & said â€œTo our deep affection for Duncanâ€. I fancy Duncan would rather have done without fuss, & he slunk off after lunch, leaving us to visit the show. Itâ€™s absurdâ€”my capacity for flooding scenes with irrational excitement; in which mood I say rather more than I mean; or rather what I do mean. Surveying the room with Adrian I thought him despondent, like a man now aware of failure, & contrasting his life with those of his contemporaries. â€˜How distinguished we all are!â€™ I said; & then it came outâ€”or did I imagine it all?â€”that he & Karin. feel themselves isolated & like people who have been ploughed in some examination. About 35 the lists are posted up for everyone to read. On the impulse of this I invited them to dine; & when they come I shall find myself, I predict, utterly at fault. Meanwhile I say nothing & have nothing to say of Duncanâ€™s pictures. They spun in my head like the white wine Iâ€™d drunk; so lovely, so delicious, so easy to adore. However I only caught glimpses here & there as well dressed people moved across them. Then tea with Roger at the Burlington, walking across with Maynard; & hearing that his book is now in the 15th thousand; but to the credit of Cambridge he remains unmoved, & is more, instead of less, modest than before.

Next day I bought one of Duncanâ€™s pictures; sacrificing a pomegranate coloured dress which much took my fancy. The dress connects itself with tea at Eilyâ€™s. She disappointed me: slovenly, compromising, slouching through life content at heart with the second best but complaining on the surfaceâ€”so she struck me; & so matronly & decorous & such a trim smug home, & such commonplace children. Honest Bernard, being honest & of the Darwin ware that never cracks, pleased me much better. He talked about golf & the Waddon Chase dispute. But I shall never see Eily again.

After that, I must skip over forgotten days & alight at Ottolineâ€™s last night (I skip tea with Ottoline & Birrell & Tony Birrell the imbecile). Yet I donâ€™t know that I can describe an evening partyâ€”Philip & I sitting together watched the door open & people come in. There were more of the shady smart sort than of old; or so they looked to me since I did not know them. There were Eliots & Huxleys & Forster &â€”all the rest. My single diversion was a dialogue with W.Â J. Turner, an inarticulate rednosed, infinitely modest man, with prominent brown eyes, nice vague eyes, seeming to wish to tell the truth; yet too shy to be ready with it. Squire felt me fathoming his soul tâ€™other night; so he said; Squire respects me immensely; oh well, Iâ€™m afraid that had some share in my liking for Turner. At a party now I feel a little famousâ€”the chances are people like Turner whose names I know, also know my name. Moreover, people like Turner are very glad to be praised. That comes always as a surprise. The Eliots gladly dine with us. Murry is affectionate & bantering. I must have one coloured figure though in my black & white; I must spare a phrase for the sealing wax green of Ottolineâ€™s dress. This bright silk stood out over a genuine crinoline. She did control the room on account of it. Yet I dreamt all night of her disillusioned with a weak pouting face, revealing her inner discontent. If anyone is disillusioned she, so they say, is. Indeed I canâ€™t help thinking her unhappy!

Last week end at the Arnold Forsters Iâ€™ve entirely left out.
