### Sunday 26 September

But I think I minded more than I let on; for somehow Jacob has come to a stop, in the middle of that party too, which I enjoyed so much. Eliot coming on the heel of a long stretch of writing fiction (2 months without a break) made me listless; cast shade upon me; & the mind when engaged upon fiction wants all its boldness & self-confidence. He said nothingâ€”but I reflected how what Iâ€™m doing is probably being better done by Mr Joyce. Then I began to wonder what it is that I am doing: to suspect, as is usual in such cases, that I have not thought my plan out plainly enoughâ€”so to dwindle, niggle, hesitateâ€”which means that oneâ€™s lost. But I think my 2 months of work are the cause of it, seeing that I now find myself veering round to John Evelyn, & even making up a paper upon Women, as a counterblast to Mr Bennettâ€™s adverse views reported in the papers. Two weeks ago I made up Jacob incessantly on my walks. An odd thing the human mind! so capricious, faithless, infinitely shying at shadows. Perhaps at the bottom of my mind, I feel that Iâ€™m distanced by L. in every respect.

Went to Charleston for the night; & had a vivid sight of Maynard by lamplightâ€”like a gorged seal, double chin, ledge of red lip, little eyes, sensual, brutal, unimaginative: one of those visions that come from a chance attitude, lost so soon as he turned his head. I suppose though it illustrates something I feel about him. Then heâ€™s read neither of my booksâ€”In spite of this I enjoyed myself: L. came over next day & found me neither suicidal nor homicidal. Home we rode after their inconvenient early teaâ€”Charleston time, invented by Maynard, being an hour before summer time. Summer time, by the way is extended for a month, owing to the threat of a strike which I say wonâ€™t take place. But what do I know?â€”canâ€™t master these leading articles. Eliot has sent me his poems, & hopes to maintain contact during the winter. This was the text of much discussion at Charleston; & in private, with Nâ essa & Dâ uncan that is, I divulged my intention to deal no more with M.H. They agreed, I think. N. produced further reasons why I should steer clear.

A hot summer day; too hot standing weeding in the sun. L. is clearing the big bed. Lottie goes tomorrow. Nelly is said to be recovered. No doubt Richmond has something to do with it.
