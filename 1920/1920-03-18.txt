### Thursday 18 March

Strange that this should be my last reflection, since without remembering it, I told Irene Noel-Baker that I dreaded the thought of meeting her after 6 or 7 years. She said the same thingâ€”but I rather guess this was simulated. Anyhow we met at the Cecils last Sunday; & I see why she dreads meeting meâ€”because I look at her. Oh you little adventuress, I think to myself, so now youâ€™ve turned matron, & are pushing your way & Philipâ€™s way into political circlesâ€”witness the bright comprehending chatter she kept up with Ld. R. & Ormsby Gore. & youâ€™ve got a son, & are proud of nursing him yourself, & youâ€™ve grown plump, & look less romanticâ€”though the positive search for obvious truths is carried on as pertinaciously as ever. Lady Beatrice daughter of Lord Salisbury, a frank dashing brainless young goddessâ€”who palpably loses divinity if you look at her. Her eyes are of the brightness, hardness, & insensibility of greyblue marbles.

Leonard went on to see Waller upon that curious family crisis which I foresaw some years ago. Still if this diary were the diary of the soul I could write at length of the 2nd meeting of the Memoir Club. Leonard was objective & triumphant; I subjective & most unpleasantly discomfited. I dont know when Iâ€™ve felt so chastened & out of humour with myselfâ€”a partner I generally respect & admire. â€œOh but why did I read this egotistic sentimental trash!â€ That was my cry, & the result of my sharp sense of the silence succeeding my chapter. It started with loud laughter; this was soon quenched; & then I couldnâ€™t help figuring a kind of uncomfortable boredom on the part of the males; to whose genial cheerful sense my revelations were at once mawkish & distasteful. What possessed me to lay bare my soul! Still, the usual revulsion has now taken place. I saw Nessa yesterday, & she guessed at none of thisâ€”which indeed Leonard firmly assured me was a miasma on my part due to late nights &c.

Another late night last night, dining with Lytton, Clive & Nessa at the Eiffel Tower. Lytton stuck in Vic: intimate & cordial, with perhaps a touch of regret. â€œHow seldom we meet!â€ said Nessa. It was true & yet we all want to meet; & canâ€™t do it. They are all speeding southâ€”Nessa, Duncan & Maynard to Italy; Lytton, Carrington & Partridge to Spain.
