Eliot is separated only by the floor from me. Nothing in mans or womans shape is any longer capable of upsetting me. The odd thing about Eliot is that his eyes are lively & youthful when the cast of his face & the shape of his sentences is formal & even heavy. Rather like a sâ câ ulpted faceâ€”no upper lip: formidable, powerful; pale. Then those hazel eyes seeming to escape from the rest of him. We talkedâ€”America, Ottoline, aristocracy, printing, Squire, Murry, criticism. â€œAnd I behaved like a priggish pompous little assâ€ was one of his comments upon his own manner at Garsington. He is decidedly of the generation beneath usâ€”I daresay superiorâ€”younger, though.
