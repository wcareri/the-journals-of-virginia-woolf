### Sunday 14 June

A disgraceful confessionâ€”this is Sunday morning, & just after ten, & here I am sitting down to write diary & not fiction or reviews, without any excuse, except the state of my mind. After finishing those two books, though, one canâ€™t concentrate directly on a new one; & then the letters, the talk, the reviews, all serve to enlarge the pupil of my mind more & more. I cant settle in, contract, & shut myself off. Iâ€™ve written 6 little stories, scrambled them down untidily, & have thought out, perhaps too clearly, To the Lighthouse. And both books so far are successful. More of Dalloway has been sold this month than of Jacob in a year. I think it possible we may sell 2,000. The Common one is making money this week. And I get treated at great length & solemnity by old gentlemen.

A powerful, heavy, light blue eyed woman of 50, Mrs Cartwright wants to succeed Murphy; & Murphy wants to stay. How people want work! How tremendous a pull a very little money has in the world! But what the solution is to be, & how we are to find it, I know not. Here I salute Leonard with unstinted, indeed childlike, adoration. Somehow he will gently & firmly decide the whole thing, while Angus & I wobble & prevaricate. But then I have a childâ€™s trust in Leonard. Waking this morning, rather depressed that Mrs D. did not sell yesterday, that we had Peter, Eileen Power & Noll & Ray last night & found it hard work, & not a single compliment vouchsafed me, that I had bought a glass necklace for Â£1, that I had a sore throat & a streaming nose, rather under the weather, I say, I snuggled in to the core of my life, which is this complete comfort with L., & there found everything so satisfactory & calm that I revived myself, & got a fresh start; feeling entirely immune. The immense success of our life, is I think, that our treasure is hid away; or rather in such common things that nothing can touch it. That is, if one enjoys a bus ride to Richmond, sitting on the green smoking, taking the letters out of the box, airing the marmots, combing Grizzle, making an ice, opening a letter, sitting down after dinner, side by side, & saying â€œAre you in your stall, brother?â€â€”well, what can trouble this happiness? And every day is necessarily full of it. If we depended upon making speeches, or money, or getting asked to partiesâ€”which reminds me of Ottolineâ€™s ghastly party the other night. What possessed me to talk all the time to Helen Anrep? Partly that the plethora of young men slightly annoys me. Really, I am not a good lioness. With all my vanity, Iâ€™m come now to be a little cynical, or why donâ€™t I so much relish the admiration of the Turners, Kitchins, & Gathorne Hardys? A woman is much more warmly sympathetic. She carries her atmosphere with her. And Ott.â€™s powers of hostesry are all worn threadbare. People sat about at great distances, & one had a sense of the clock ticking & Ott. saying This is a failure, a failure, & not knowing how to pick the pieces up.

Now I must answer Gerald Brenan, & read the Genji; for tomorrow I make a second Â£20 from Vogue. Did I say that I am rejected by Sybil? From being Sybil, she has become Lady Colefax. No invitations for a month.
