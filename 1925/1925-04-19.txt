### Sunday 19 April

It is now after dinner, our first summer time night, & the mood for writing has left me, only just brushed me & left me. I have not achieved my sacred half hour yet. But thinkâ€”in time to come I would rather read something here than reflect that I did polish off Mr Ring Lardner successfully. Iâ€™m out to make Â£300 this summer by writing, & build a bath & hot water range at Rodmell. But, hush, hushâ€”my books tremble on the verge of coming out, & my future is uncertain. As for forecastsâ€”its just on the cards Mrs Dalloway is a success (Harcourt thinks it â€œwonderfulâ€), & sells 2,000â€”I dont expect it: I expect a slow silent increase of fame, such has come about, rather miraculously, since Js R. was published; my value mounting steadily as a journalist, though scarcely a copy sold. And I am not very nervousâ€”rather; & I want as usual to dig deep down into my new stories, without having a looking glass flashed in my eyes Todd, to wit; Colefax to wit et cetera.

Lytton came in the other night. He seemed to me autumnal; with that charming rectitude of spirit which no one else attains so perfectly I think. His justice of mind is considerable. But Christ is dismissed, to his disappointment, for he grows more & more fussy about subjects: Christ, he says did not exist: was a figment; & so much is known that really he couldnâ€™t pull it all together in one book. Then perhaps Philip Ritchie is waning. We talked of old buggers & their lack of attraction for young men. My anti-bugger revolution has run round the world, as I hoped it would. I am a little touched by what appears their contrition, & anxiety to condone their faults. Yet if I cant say whatâ€™s in my mind, & have a fling with Cliveâ€™s Colonel now & then, whatâ€™s the use of me? The pale star of the Bugger has been in the ascendant too long. Julian agrees emphatically. We had Good Friday at Rodmellâ€”June weather, & again this downy billowy wave beneath us: ah, but how quickly I sink; what violet shadows there are between the high lights, & one, perhaps, as unreasonable as another. But this properly belongs to a story.

Yesterday we went to Maxâ€™s show with dear shabby old Angus, who seems to me an elder brother, 20 years younger than I am. We came back to tea (over all this the bloom of the past descends as I writeâ€”it becomes sad, beautiful, memorable) & ate a great many buns, & then discussed Murphy. Alas!â€”she has a temper. She is an ill-conditioned mongrel woman, of no charm, a Bohemian scallywag, something like Irish stew to look at, & not destined for a long life here, I suppose. But Angus, though plaintive is gentlemanly; does not insist, & sees the drawbacks; Leonard will have to pull out the tooth on Thursday. I suspect some hidden grievance: I suspect she harbours scores.

Marjory & her Tom looked in at the basement this evening, very happy, L. says, & indeed I think she must enjoy her situation to the last ounceâ€”money, food, security, & a supply of young men, & her faithful Tom, & a little dress allowance, & breakfast late, & consideration. She is a nice trusty creature into the bargain, & if I wished to see anyone, I daresay it would be her.

At this moment, all we wish is to escape seeing anyone. Tomorrow I shall buy a new dress. I observe here that I am becoming jerky & jumpy, & my conscience is asserting that I ought to read Mr Ring Lardner & earn my 50 guineas.
