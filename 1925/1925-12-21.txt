But no Vita! But Vita for 3 days at Long Barn, from which L. & I returned yesterday. These Sapphists love women; friendship is never untinged with amorosity. In short, my fears & refrainings, my â€˜impertinenceâ€™ my usual self-consciousness in intercourse with people who maynâ€™t want me & so onâ€”were all, as L. said, sheer fudge; &, partly thanks to him (he made me write) I wound up this wounded & stricken year in great style. I like her & being with her, & the splendourâ€”she shines in the grocers shop in Sevenoaks with a candle lit radiance, stalking on legs like beech trees, pink glowing, grape clustered, pearl hung. That is the secret of her glamour, I suppose. Anyhow she found me incredibly dowdy, no woman cared less for personal appearanceâ€”no one put on things in the way I did. Yet so beautiful, &c. What is the effect of all this on me? Very mixed. There is her maturity & full breastedness: her being so much in full sail on the high tides, where I am coasting down backwaters; her capacity I mean to take the floor in any company, to represent her country, to visit Chatsworth, to control silver, servants, chow dogs; her motherhood (but she is a little cold & offhand with her boys) her being in short (what I have never been) a real woman. Then there is some voluptuousness about her; the grapes are ripe; & not reflective. No. In brain & insight she is not as highly organised as I am. But then she is aware of this, & so lavishes on me the maternal protection which, for some reason, is what I have always most wished from everyone. What L. gives me, & Nessa gives me, & Vita, in her more clumsy external way, tries to give me. For of course, mingled with all this glamour, grape clusters & pearl necklaces, there is something loose fitting. How much, for example, shall I really miss her when she is motoring across the desert? I will make a note on that next year. Anyhow, I am very glad that she is coming to tea today, & I shall ask her, whether she minds my dressing so badly? I think she does. I read her poem; which is more compact, better seen & felt than anything yet of hers.

Maryâ€™s stories, I fear, are bad. Dear meâ€”then Roger is in love with Hâ elen Anrep. Morganâ€™s article has cheered me very much. L. is doing up rubber seals & fur rabbits at the moment. The workmen are hammering, their engines throbbing outside on the hotel. We go down to Charleston tomorrow, not without some trepidation on my part, partly because I shall be hung about with trailing clouds of glory from Long Barn wh. always disorientates me & makes me more than usually nervous: then I amâ€”altogether so queer in some ways. One emotion succeeds another.
