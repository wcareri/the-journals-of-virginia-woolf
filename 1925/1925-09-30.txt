### Wednesday 30 September

This was I suppose successfully accomplished; & it is now Wednesday morning, damp & close & over all the sense already of transmigration, of shedding one habit for another. My autumn coat is grown. I begin to sympathise with Nellyâ€™s longing for the ease & speed of civilisation. But I vow here not to be misled into thinking this is lifeâ€”this perpetual frenzy & stretch; or I shall again be deposited in a heap, as I was in August.

Today we are on Tomâ€™s track, riddling & reviling him. He wonâ€™t let Read off that book, has been after him 3 or 4 months. Dignity is our line; & really, as far as the poaching of authors goes, he wonâ€™t harm us. Then there is the fascination of a breach; I mean, after feeling all this time conscious of something queer about him, it is more satisfactory to have it on the surface. Not that I want a breach: what I want is a revelation. But L. thinks the queer shifty creature will slip away now.

I actually forgot to record the finish of the Lottie dramaâ€”sheâ€™s in love with the cowman at Thorpe -le-Soken! This emerged after an hours violent argument with Nelly. This explains & excuses all: & we are, for private reasons, thoroughly content. What is worse, is poor unfortunate Karinâ€”in operating, they cut a nerve in her face, which is half paralysed. She canâ€™t speak, I gather, without being all screwed up. She refuses to see the children for fear of frightening them. This final malignancy on the part of fate seems to me her knock out blow; save that somehow she will, I suppose, find a way round, as people mostly do. This softens the heart towards her. It makes one think of her courage. But how quickly the intense feeling of sympathy passes, & she resumes her place in ones mind as a person one is conscious of being permanently, dully, sorry for. But then propinquity will revive it: Tavistock Sqre, being next door, will make one more conscious of the horror of screwing up oneâ€™s own face.
