### Thursday 24 September

â€”sad to think a week only left whole of this partially wrecked summer; however, I donâ€™t complain, seeing as how I have dipped my head in health again & feel stabilised once more about the spinal cord, which is always the centre of my being. Maynard & Lydia came here yesterdayâ€”M. in Tolstoiâ€™s blouse & Russian cap of black astrachanâ€”A fair sight, both of them, to meet on the high road! An immense good will & vigour pervades him. She hums in his wake, the great mans wife. But though one could carp, one can also find them very good company, & my heart, in this the autumn of my age, slightly warms to him, whom Iâ€™ve known all these years, so truculently pugnaciously, & unintimately. We had very brisk talk of Russia: such a hotch-potch, such a mad jumble, M. says, of good & bad, & the most extreme things that he can make no composition of itâ€”canâ€™t yet see how it goes. Briefly, spies everywhere, no liberty of speech, greed for money eradicated, people living in common, yet some, Lâ ydiaâ€™s mother for instance with servants, peasants contented because they own land, no sign of revolution, artistocrats acting showmen to their possessions, ballet respected, best show of Cezanne & Matisse in existence. Endless processions of communists in top hats, prices exorbitant, yet champagne produced, & the finest cooking in Europe, banquets beginning at 8.30 & going on till 2.30; people getting slightly drunk, say about 11, & wandering round the table. Kalinin getting up, & perambulating followed by a little crowd who clapped him steadily as he walked; then the immense luxury of the old Imperial trains; feeding off the Tsars plate; interview with Zinoviev who (I think) was a suave cosmopolital Jew, but had two fanatical watch dogs with square faces, guarding him, & mumbling out their mysteries, fanatically. One prediction of theirs, to the effect that in 10 years time the standard of living will be higher in Russia than it was before the war, but in all other countries lower, M. thought might very well come true. Anyhow they are crammed & packed with sights & talks: Maynard has a medal set in diamonds, & L. a gold sovereign wh. she was allowed to take from the bags at the mint.

But the Keynesâ€™, I need hardly say, renewed my headache, & when Lytton came, I was drooping over the fire, & could not do much battle with that old serpent. What was said I think was to the effect that he had had a fire at Hamspray, which blistered the wall, but did not touch his booksâ€”& what fire could have the heart to do that? Then he had read Bunny â€œReally its very extraordinaryâ€”so arty,â€”so composedâ€”the competence terrific, but â€¦ well, its like a perfectly restored Innâ€”Ye Olde â€¦ everything tidied up & restored.â€ No Bunny in it, as there were signs of being in The Man in the Zoo; no humour; a perfect restoration.

But to tell the truth, I am exacerbated this morning. It is 10.25, on a fine grey still day; Lily is doing my bedroom; the starlings are in the apple tree; Leonard is in London, & Nelly I suppose is settling the greatest question of her whole lifeâ€”what marriage is to a womanâ€”with Lottie. Lily is a wide eyed sheep dog girl who comes from Iford to â€˜doâ€™; but canâ€™t scramble an egg or bake a potato, & is thus ill armed for life, so far as I can see.

Beginning at 9.45 I wrote two pages of a story, as a test again; & passed it well, I think, anyhow my cistern is full of ideas. But to the point: why am I exacerbated? By Roger. I told him I had been ill all the summer. His reply isâ€”silence as to that; but plentiful descriptions of his own front teeth. Egotism, egotismâ€”it is the essential ingredient in a clever manâ€™s life I believe. It protects; it enhances; it preserves his own vital juices entire by keeping them banked in. Also I cannot help thinking that he suspects me of valetudinarianism & this enrages me: & L. is away & I cant have my thorn picked out by him, so must write it out. There! it is better now; & I think I hear the papers come; & will get them, my woolwork, & a glass of milk.
