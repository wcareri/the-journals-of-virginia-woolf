How my handwriting goes down hill! Another sacrifice to the Hogarth Press. Yet what I owe the Hogarth Press is barely paid by the whole of my handwriting. Havenâ€™t I just written to Herbert Fisher refusing to do a book for the Home University Series on Post Victorian?â€”knowing that I can write a book, a better book, a book off my own bat, for the Press if I wish! To think of being battened down in the hold of those University dons fairly makes my blood run cold. Yet Iâ€™m the only woman in England free to write what I like. The others must be thinking of seriesâ€™ & editors. Yesterday I heard from Harcourt Brace that Mrs D. & C.R. are selling 148 & 73 weeklyâ€”Isnâ€™t that a surprising rate for the 4th month? Doesnâ€™t it portend a bathroom & a w.c. either here, or Southease? I am writing in the watery blue sunset, repentance of an ill tempered morose day, which vanished, the clouds, I have no doubt, showing gold over the downs, & leaving a soft gold fringe on the top there.
