### Monday 14 September

A disgraceful factâ€”I am writing this at 10 in the morning in bed in the little room looking into the garden, the sun beaming steady, the vine leaves transparent green, & the leaves of the apple tree so brilliant that, as I had my breakfast, I invented a little story about a man who wrote a poem, I think, comparing them with diamonds, & the spiders webs (which glance & disappear astonishingly) with something or other else: which led me to think of Marvell on a country life, so to Herrick, & the reflection that much of it was dependent upon the town & gaietyâ€”a reaction. However, I have forgotten the facts. I am writing this partly to test my poor bunch of nerves at the back of my neckâ€”will they hold or give again, as they have done so often?â€”for Iâ€™m amphibious still, in bed & out of it; partly to glut my itch (â€˜glutâ€™ and â€˜itchâ€™!) for writing. It is the great solace, & scourge. Leonard is in London this solitary perfect day; this day of the peculiar September mintage; talking to Murphy in the basement, while the vans rumble by, & peoples skirts & trousers appear at the top of the area. This leads us to think of selling Monks, & spending our summers, quit of Press, quit of Nelly, quit of Nation, quit of polar blasts, in the South of France. The news that Mr Wilkinson is longing to buy Monks shakes our resolution to sell it. A walk, in pearly mottled weather, on the marshes, plunges me in love again. Leonard then finds his potato crop good, & his autumn crocuses rising. We have been in the throes of the usual servant crisisâ€”varied this time it is true: Nelly says Lottie wants to come back; we offer to have her; she denies itâ€”to Karin; to Nelly she prevaricates. I was flung into a passion with Karin, & so precipitated another headache. But we are on the laps of the Gods: we donâ€™t intend to raise a finger either way. Only it is a curious reflection that a little strain with servants more effectually screws the nerves at the back of the head than any other I am aware of. Now why? It is because it is subterranean, partly. Tom has treated us scurvily, much in the manner that he has treated the Hutchinsons. On Monday I get a letter that fawns & flatters, implores me to write for his new 4ly; & proposes to discuss press matters as soon as we get back; on Thursday we read in the Lit. Supt. that his new firm is publishing Waste Land & his other poemsâ€”a fact which he dared not confess, but sought to palliate by flattering me. He treated Jack in the same way over Vivienâ€™s story in the Criterion. The Underworldâ€”the dodges & desires of the Underworld, its shifts & cabals are at the bottom of it. He intends to get on by the methods of that world; & my world is really not the underworld. However, there is a kind of fun in unravelling the twists & obliquities of this remarkable man. How far will they make his poetry squint? Anyhow, at my age, without illusions of that sort any moreâ€”I mean in the greatness of Tom, or the greatness of any of us, or our power to influence each other intellectuallyâ€”I remain detached, & composed. Plenty of other illusions remain to meâ€”emotional, personal; the pleasures of inventing Wednesday walks this winter is now uppermost. Iâ€™m going to Greenwich, to Caen Woods, to Gunnersbury, all in the dripping autumn weather, with tea at an A.B.C. & home to a hot bath. Really I am going to let myself slacken in social ways: instead of feeling that I shirk a hedge, in refusing Lord Berners or Lady Colefax, I am going to allow myself to do so approvingly; saying that I strengthen a paragraph in The Lighthouse thereby, or add another hour to the shabby crony talk which I love best. Not but what I shall dip here & there; but without anxiety or preparation of clothes or any of that struggle. This gives me a delicious sense of ease. And I have earned it, too, for I spread my Â£35 dress allowance to its furthest, & braved many a party spartanly â€˜on principleâ€™ as the marmots would say. The â€˜principleâ€™ which I find intermittently guiding my life isâ€”to take oneâ€™s fences. Heaven knows how Iâ€™ve dreaded them! Now, with my Studio habitable, & another servant perhaps, I shall aim at haphazard, bohemian meetings, music (we have the algraphone, & thats a heavenly prospectâ€”music after dinner while I stitch at my woolworkâ€”I go to Lewes this afternoon to meet Nessa & buy wools) people of our own standard dropping in; ease, slippers, smoke, buns, chocolate. For Iâ€™m naturally sociable; it cannot be denied.
