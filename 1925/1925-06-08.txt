### Monday 8 June

This is the hottest June on record. Do not take this seriouslyâ€”only it is very hot. & we were at Karinâ€™s yesterday. There was Irene & her Phil. I am too sleepy having got up at Â¼ to 6 this morning to describe her. She has spread a little, has a double chin, an emphatic nose, & the feet of gulls on sand round her eyes, which are of the old staring sea green blue. And she has her old waysâ€”her straightforwardness, downrightness, ideals; love of adventure, but none of this is so becoming as of old. For in fact sheâ€™s grown stereotyped, metallic, harsh; her voice brazen, & her cheeks crude. She suspected me, & suspected Bloomsbury, & adored Leonard, whom she thought so salutary for Phil, but we both suspect a scheme for making Phil the foreign sec. in the next Labour Government. I liked her best when she talked about the Greek peasants, & that side may retain some charm. But she talks, talks, talks; thrusts her way with a hard kind of energy into whatever may be going forwardâ€”would like, I imagine, to wire pull, & be hostess, & know the right people, but instead protests a horror of success, & wants to keep Phil unspoilt. She also wants to be the mistress of men, I imagine, & a little resents that age should have unseated her from that familiar post, as it very obviously has. She veered, as usual, towards Desmond, professed her horror of â€œhurting Mollyâ€”a very gallant creatureâ€, & almost drove L. distracted by asking him what he thought of the character of every politician.

No, she has not worn well; the plating has come off & sheâ€™s rather steely & common underneath. Needless to say, I had some waves of ancient emotion, chiefly at the sound of her voice & sight of her handsâ€”hands expressing motherhood, perhaps; but mostly felt very flat, unable to pump up anything, & thus uncomfortable. To this, the sordid East End country, the woman who whispers with a gashed throat, the terrific pound home along the hot road, added. And the taxi never came, & we had a second night of it, hearing good, pure hearted Phil, with his principles & his ability, & his athleticism, read aloud to Irene till late.
