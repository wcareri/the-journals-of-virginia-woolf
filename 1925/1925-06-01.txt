### Monday 1 June

Bank holiday, & we are in London. To record my books fates slightly bores me; but now both are floated, & Mrs D. doing surprisingly well. 1070 already sold. I recorded Morganâ€™s opinion: then Vita was a little doubtful; then Desmond, whom I see frequently about his book, dashed all my praise by saying that Logan thought the C.R. well enough, but nothing more. Desmond has an abnormal power for depressing one. He takes the edge off life in some extraordinary way; I love him; but his balance & goodness & humour, all heavenly in themselves, somehow diminish lustre. I think I feel this not only about my work, but about life. However, now comes Mrs Hardy to say that Thomas reads, & hears the C.R. read, with â€œgreat pleasureâ€. Indeed, save for Logan, & heâ€™s a salt veined American, I have had high praise. Also Tauchnitz asks about them.

We are now considering a change to a widow called by courtesy Smith, Jonesâ€™ sister; which will despatch poor Murphy, but one canâ€™t be very sentimental over her, & to settle in with a placid powerful professional woman is precisely what we want to pull us together. Angus is a little languidâ€”not that we in any way, I hasten to say, complain of him; but Murphy is temperamental, untidy, sloppy, & turns crusty about accounts.

A week ago we had a great invasionâ€”Ottoline surprising us with Julian Philip & a Gathorne Hardy. Ottoline was very affectionate, & perhaps affection being so much time & habit, I too have some real affection for her. But how can I analyse my feelings? I like everyone, I said at 46 the other night; & Duncan said I liked everyone, & thought everyone quite new each time. That was at dinner to meet Miss Warner, the new Chatto & Windus poetess, & indeed she has some meritâ€”enough to make me spend 2/6 on her, I think. It is a sunny fitful day, & standing in Hyde Park to listen to the socialists, that furtive Jew, Loeb, who dogs my life at intervals of 10 years, touched us on the shoulder, & took 2 photographs of us, measuring his distance with a black tape, provided by his wife. He usually tells people to hold one end next their hearts: but this is a joke. He had been hanging about Covent Garden to photograph singers & had lunched at 2.30. I asked if he were a professional, which hurt his pride: he owned to taking a great interest in it, & said he had a large collection.

Tom came in yesterday, rather rockier than last time, not quite so flushed with emotion, & inclined to particularise the state of Vivienâ€™s bowels too closely for my taste. We both almost laughed; she has a queer rib, a large liver, & so on. What is more to the point is that Tom is to be the editor of a new mag quarterly, which some old firm is issuing in the autumn, & all his works must go to themâ€”a blow for us.

He said nothing of my books. With great dignity, I did not ask for his opinion. People often dont read books for weeks & weeks. And anyhow, for my part I hate giving an opinion.
