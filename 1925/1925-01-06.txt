### Tuesday 6 January

The disgraceful truth is that I shall run year into year, for I cant waste so many blank pages.

What a flourish I began 1924 with! And today, for the 165th time, Nelly has given noticeâ€”Wonâ€™t be dictated to: must do as other girls do. This is the fruit of Bloomsbury. On the whole, Iâ€™m inclined to take her at her word. The nuisance of arranging life to suit her fads, & the pressure of â€˜other girlsâ€™ is too much, good cook though she is, & honest, crusty old maid too, dependable, in the main, affectionate, kindly, but incurably fussy, nervy, unsubstantial. Anyhow, the servant question no longer much worries me.

Last night we dined at 3 Albert Road Maryâ€™s new villa. I like the new year to begin with warm friendly feelingsâ€”& it was a superb dinner. There were the children too, a nice girl & boy; a girl with lovely womans eyes, sympathetic, startled; & wild like a girl. (I want to begin to describe my own sex.) What do I mean about the expression? Extreme youth, & yet, one felt, this feeling has been existing forever; very feminine. Here I conceive my storyâ€”but Iâ€™m always conceiving stories now. Short onesâ€”scenesâ€”for instance The Old Man (a character of L.S.) The Professor on Miltonâ€”(an attempt at literary criticism) & now The Interruption, women talking alone. However, back to life. Where are we?

I spent this morning writing a note on an Elizabeâ than playâ€”for which I have been reading plays all this year. Then I found the minute hand of my watch had come off (this was talking to Lytton about Samuel Richardson last nightâ€”I found it off then): so I went into the printing room to see the timeâ€”found Angus & Leonard doing Simkinâ€™s bill. Stayed & laughed. L. went off to the office, when we had dog-walked round the Square. I came in & set a page of Nancy. Then out to Ingersoll to get my watch mended. Then dog walked. Then here. It being a black grained winter day; lengths of the pavement ink black where not lighted. Never shall I describe all the days I have noticed. I cannot hit it off, quite, & yet perhaps if I read this again I shall see what. I meant then.

Rodmell was all gale & flood; these words are exact. The river overflowed. We had 7 days rain out of 10. Often I could not face a walk. L. pruned, which needed heroic courage. My heroism was purely literary. I revised Mrs Dâ alloway: the dullest part of the whole business of writing; the most depressing & exacting. The worst part is at the beginning (as usual) where the aeroplane has it all to itself for some pages, & it wears thin. L. read it; thinks it my bestâ€”but then has he not got to think so? Still I agree. He thinks it has more continuity than Jâ acobâ s Room. but is difficult owing to the lack of connection, visible; between the two themes.

Anyhow it is sent off to Clarks, & proofs will come next week. This is for Harcourt Brace, who has accepted without seeing & raised me to 15 p.c.

I did not see very much at Rodmell, having to keep my eyes on the typewriter.

Angus was with us for Christmas, a very quiet, very considerate, unselfish deliberate young man, with a charming sense of humourâ€”colourless, Lytton says: passive. But I think well of him, all the same.
