Two unfavourable reviews of Mrs D (Western Mail & Scotsman): unintelligible, not art &c: & a letter from a young man in Earls Court â€œThis time you have done itâ€”you have caught life & put it in a bookâ€¦â€ Please forgive this outburst, but further quotation is unnecessary; & I dont think I should bother to write this, if I werenâ€™t jangled what by? The sudden heat, I think, & the racket of life. It is bad for me to see my own photograph. And I have been lunching with Desmond, & reading that dear old Owlâ€™s journalism. The thing is, he cant thrust through an article. Now, Lytton or I, though we maynâ€™t think better or write better, have a drive in us, which makes an article whole. And yet there are things worth keeping, & he becomes moved, & irrational when he thinks of it, & I want him to be pleasedâ€”So we lunched in the grill of the Connaught Rooms where other men were talking business, had a bottle of wine & delved into the filth packets as he calls them. Home to find Vogue sending photographsâ€”more photographs: T.P. wants one, the Morning Post another. & the C.R. sells 2 or 3 copies a day.

We are going to the play out into this tawny coloured Londonâ€”but journalism is the devil. I cannot write after reading it. No timeâ€”& I must change, & write about clothes some day soon.
