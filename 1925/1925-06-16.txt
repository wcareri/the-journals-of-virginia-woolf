### Tuesday 16 June

This is the fag end of my morningâ€™s work on Genji, which runs a little too easily from my pen & must be compressed & compacted. Dalloway, I fear, has hit her head against some impassable barrier of the public, just as Jacob did, & scarcely sells these last 3 days. Yet my friends are enthusiasticâ€”really so, I think; & ready to acclaim me successful, arrived, triumphant with this book: Clive, Mary, Molly, Roger, my latest allies. We have sold 1240, I think; so the wave spread further than Jacob, & has a ripple left perhaps.

Tonight is Leonardâ€™s festival night, the feast of the Brethren Apostles, & presumably some overflow of them here. â€œWhy do human beings invent these ways of torturing themselves?â€ Themâ€™s his words; for he has to preside & speak. Old Lytton, I am reminded, has fairly passed from our lives. No word about my books; no visits since Easter. I imagine that when he takes a new love, & he has Angus, he gets surly, like a stag; he feels a little ridiculous, uneasy, & does not relish the company of old cynical friends like ourselves. And in fact, when I hear the story from Angus, of his agony & entreaty & despair, I only feel slightly nauseated. He makes the young men pity him & laugh at him, & there is a touch of senility in this exposure of himself, while, practically speaking, his amours land him in society of the most tepid, milk & watery kind; nothing that taxes his mind or stimulates; poor feeble Philip for instance, who is precisely like an Eton boy in an Eton jacket: give him an ice & a sovereign.

â€œThemâ€™s his wordsâ€â€”this reminds me I must get back to D. Copperfield. There are moments when all the masterpieces do no more than strum upon broken strings. It is very rareâ€”the right mood for readingâ€”in its way as intense a delight as any; but for the most part pain.
