### Saturday 21 March

This disgrace has been already explainedâ€”I think: two books to see through the press, mainly between tea & dinner; influenza, & a distaste for the pen. At the moment (I have 7Â½ before dinner) I can only note that the past is beautiful because one never realises an emotion at the time. It expands later, & thus we donâ€™t have complete emotions about the present, only about the past. This struck me on Reading platform, watching Nessa & Quentin kiss, he coming up shyly, yet with some emotion. This I shall remember; & make more of, when separated from all the business of crossing the platform, finding our bus &c. That is why we dwell on the past, I think.

We went to see the children at school: the young men, I should say. Julian was shut up in a pound, pounding Mr Eliotâ€™s tennis court by way of punishment. (That suggests a story about a man whose ambition it was to buy a field; this kept him alive; when he bought it, he died.) Mr Goddard came up, & Julian shouted out, â€œIâ€™m at it till 5â€ as though they were undergraduates. Not much public school about this; but oh the horror of being Mr Goddard, & wandering out, this bitter day (it snowed) to welcome home the steeplechasers. When they ran in, they at once rolled on the ground, & were covered with rugs & coats. The last lap, their legs rose very weakly. J. & Q. were utterly cynical about this, & said no one enjoyed it, but it was thought the right thing to do. But this nib scratches.
