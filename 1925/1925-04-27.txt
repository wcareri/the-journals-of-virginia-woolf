### Monday 27 April

The Common Reader was out on Thursday: this is Monday, & so far I have not heard a word about it, private or public: it is as if one tossed a stone into a pond, & the waters closed without a ripple. And I am perfectly content, & care less than I have ever cared, & make this note just to remind me next time of the sublime progress of my books. I have been sitting to Vogue, the Becks that is, in their mews, which Mr Woolner built as his studio, & perhaps it was there he thought of my mother, whom he wished to marry, I think. But my present reflection is that people have any number of states of consciousness: & I should like to investigate the party consciousness, the frock consciousness &c. The fashion world at the Becksâ€”Mrs Garland was there superintending a displayâ€”is certainly one; where people secrete an envelope which connects them & protects them from others, like myself, who am outside the envelope, foreign bodies. These states are very difficult (obviously I grope for words) but Iâ€™m always coming back to it. The party consciousness, for example: Sybilâ€™s consciousness. You must not break it. It is something real. You must keep it up; conspire together. Still I cannot get at what I mean. Then I meant to dash off Graves before I forget him.

Figure a bolt eyed blue shirted shockheaded hatless man in a blue overcoat standing goggling at the door at 4.30, on Friday. â€œMrs Woolf?â€ I dreading & suspecting some Nation genius, some young man determined to unbosom himself, rushed him to the basement, where he said â€œIâ€™m Gravesâ€. â€œIâ€™m Gravesâ€. Everybody stared. He appeared to have been rushing through the air at 60 miles an hour & to have alighted temporarily. So he came up, &, wily as I am, I knew that to advance holding the kettle in a dishclout was precisely, the right method, attitude, pose. The poor boy is all emphasis protestation & pose. He has a crude likeness to Shelley, save that his nose is a switchback & his lines blurred. But the consciousness of genius is bad for people. He stayed till 7.15 (we were going to Caesar & Cleopatraâ€”a strange rhetorical romantic early Shaw play) & had at last to say so, for he was so thick in the delight of explaining his way of life to us that no bee stuck faster to honey. He cooks, his wife cleans; 4 children are brought up in the elementary school; the villagers give them vegetables; they were married in Church; his wife calls herself Nancy Nicolson; wonâ€™t go to Garsington, said to him I must have a house for nothing; on a river; in a village with a square church tower; near but not on a railwayâ€”all of which, as she knows her mind, he procured. Calling herself Nicolson has sorted her friends into sheep & goats. All this to us sounded like the usual self consciousness of young men, especially as he threw in, gratuitously, the information that he descends from dean rector, Bishop, Von Ranker &c &c &c: only in order to say that he despises them. Still, still, he is a nice ingenuous rattle headed young man; but why should our age put this burden of proof on us? Surely once one could live simply without protestations. I tried, perhaps, to curry favour, as my weakness is. L. was adamant. Then we were offered a ticket for the Cup tie, to see wh. Graves has come to London after 6 years; cant travel in a train without being sick; is rather proud of his sensibility. No I donâ€™t think heâ€™ll write great poetry: but what will you? The sensitive are needed too; the halfbaked, stammering stuttering, who perhaps improve their own quarter of Oxfordshire.

And on Sunday we had our first walk, to Epping.
