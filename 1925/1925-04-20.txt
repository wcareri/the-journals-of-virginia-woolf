### Monday 20 April

Happiness is to have a little string onto which things will attach themselves. For example, going to my dressmaker in Judd Street, or rather thinking of a dress I could get her to make, & imagining it madeâ€”that is the string, which as if it dipped loosely into a wave of treasure brings up pearls sticking to it. Poor Murphy is in the glumps, owing to Leonardâ€™s fiery harshnessâ€”each of which epithets he would most certainly deny. She has no string dipping into the green wave: things donâ€™t connect for her; & add up into those entrancing bundles which are happiness. And my days are likely to be strung with them. I like this London life in early summerâ€”the street sauntering & square haunting, & then if my books (I never speak of L.â€™s pamphlet) were to be a success; if we could begin building at Monks, & put up wireless for Nelly, & get the Skeats to live at Shanksâ€™ cottageâ€”ifâ€”ifâ€”ifâ€”What will happen is some intensities of pleasure, some profound plunges of gloom. Bad reviews, being ignored; & then some delicious clap of compliment. But really what I should like would be to have Â£3 to buy a pair of rubber soled boots, & go for country walks on Sundays.

One thing in considering my state of mind now, seems to me beyond dispute, that I have at last, bored down into my oil well, & canâ€™t scribble fast enough to bring it all to the surface. I have now at least 6 stories welling up in me, & feel, at last, that I can coin all my thoughts into words. Not but what an infinite number of problems remain; but I have never felt this rush & urgency before. I believe I can write much more quickly: if writing it isâ€”this dash at the paper of a phrase, & then the typing & retypingâ€”trying it over, the actual writing being now like the sweep of a brush; I fill it up afterwards. Now suppose I might become one of the interestingâ€”I will not say greatâ€”but interesting novelists? Oddly, for all my vanity, I have not until now had much faith in my novels, or thought them my own expression.
