### Friday 1 May

This is a note for future reference as they say. The Common Reader came out 8 days ago, & so far not a single review has appeared, & no body has written to me or spoken to me about it or in any way acknowledged the fact of its existence; save Maynard, Lydia, & Duncan. Clive is conspicuously dumb; Mortimer has flu & cant review it; Nancy saw him reading it, but reported no opinion: all signs which point to a dull chill depressing reception; & complete failure. I have just come through the hoping fearing stage, & now see my disappointment floating like an old bottle in my wake & am off on fresh adventures. Only if the same thing happens to Dalloway one need not be surprised. But I must write to Gwen.
