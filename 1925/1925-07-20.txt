### Monday 20 July

Here the door opened, & Morgan came in to ask us out to lunch with him at the Etoile, which we did, though we had a nice veal & ham pie at home (this is in the classic style of journalists). It comes of Swift perhaps, the last words of which I have just written, & so fill up time here.

I should consider my work list now. I think a little story, perhaps a review, this fortnight; having a superstitious wish to begin To the Lighthouse the first day at Monks House. I now think I shall finish it in the two months there. The word â€˜sentimentalâ€™ sticks in my gizzard (Iâ€™ll write it out of me in a storyâ€”Ann Watkins of New York is coming on Wednesday to enquire about my stories). But this theme may be sentimental; father & mother & child in the garden: the death; the sail to the lighthouse. I think, though, that when I begin it I shall enrich it in all sorts of ways; thicken it; give it branches & roots which I do not perceive now. It might contain all characters boiled down; & childhood; & then this impersonal thing, which Iâ€™m dared to do by my friends, the flight of time, & the consequent break of unity in my design. That passage (I conceive the book in 3 parts: 1. at the drawing room window; 2. seven years passed; 3. the voyage:) interests me very much. A new problem like that breaks fresh ground in ones mind; prevents the regular ruts.

Last night Clive dined with us; & Nelly is rather waspish about it this morning; & tried to run away before Ottoline came; but it proved to be Adrian; & then we talked of cancer, & Clive got set, & Ottoline came, in tea kettle taffeta, all looped & scolloped & fringed with silver lace, & talked about Rupert & Jacques, & re-told, with emendations, the story of Ka & Henry Lamb & herself. She has been working over these old stories so often, that they hold no likeness to the truthâ€”they are stale, managed, pulled this way & that, as we used to knead & pull the crumb of bread, till it was a damp slab. Then the old motor was heard hooting & there was Philip & Julian, at which, at Julian that is, Clive cheered up, & was very brisk & obliging as he knows how. We argued the case of the aristocracy v. the middle class. I rather liked it. But one seldom says anything very profound. I like the sense of other people liking it, as I suppose the Morrells do, for they settle on us like a cloud of crows, once a week now. My vanity as a hostess is flattered. Sometimes a buttery crumb of praise is thrown to meâ€”â€œLady Desborough admires your books enormouslyâ€”wants to meet youâ€â€”& then Clive, looking at my photographs in Vogue says of the one last yearâ€”â€œThat is charmingâ€”but must be taken very long ago, I supposeâ€â€”so you see how I switch back from pleasure to pain, & time was when I should have ended the evening fast stuck in black despair, gone to bed like a diver with pursed lips shooting into oblivion. But enough, enoughâ€”I coin this little catchword to control my tendency to flower into phrase after phrase. Some are good though.

What shall I read at Rodmell? I have so many books at the back of my mind. I want to read voraciously & gather material for the Lives of the Obscureâ€”which is to tell the whole history of England in one obscure life after another. Proust I should like to finish. Stendhal, & then to skirmish about hither & thither. These 8 weeks at Rodmell always seem capable of holding an infinite amount. Shall we buy the house at Southease? I suppose not.
