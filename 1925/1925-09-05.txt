### Saturday 5 September

And why couldnâ€™t I see or feel that all this time I was getting a little used up & riding on a flat tire? So I was, as it happened; & fell down in a faint at Charleston, in the middle of Q.â€™s birthday party: & then have lain about here, in that odd amphibious life of headache, for a fortnight. This has rammed a big hole in my 8 weeks which were to be stuffed so full. Never mind. Arrange whatever pieces come your way. Never be unseated by the shying of that undependable brute, life, hag ridden as she is by my own queer, difficult nervous system. Even at 43 I dont know its workings, for I was saying to myself, all the summer, â€œIâ€™m quite adamant now. I can go through a tussle of emotions peaceably that two years ago even, would have raked me raw.â€

I have made a very quick & flourishing attack on To the Lighthouse, all the sameâ€”22 pages straight off in less than a fortnight. I am still crawling & easily enfeebled, but if I could once get up steam again, I believe I could spin it off with infinite relish. Think what a labour the first pages of Dalloway were! Each word distilled by a relentless clutch on my brain.

I took up the pen meaning to write on â€œDisillusionmentâ€. I have never had any illusion so completely burnt out of me as my illusion about the Richmonds. This they effected between 4 & 6 yesterday. But Elena has no beauty, no charm, no very marked niceness even! Any country parsons wife is her match. Her nose is red, her cheeks blowsed: her eyes without character. Even her voice & movements which used to be adorable, her distinction, her kindly charmâ€”all have vanished; she is a thick, dowdy, obliterated woman, who has no feelings, no sympathies, prominences & angles are all completely razed bare. Seriously, one as doubts for her complete mental equipment. The conversation was practically imbecile: for instance: (E). I think I could get very fond on a house. But we are so lucky. There are some delightful people near. People who like the same sort of things we do. (B). We are very lucky. There are two fellows within 4 miles who were at Winchester with me. One went to Ceylon as a tea planter. They both farm now. Are you lucky in your clergyman? So much depends in the country on oneâ€™s clergyman. (E). I really forget anything more from the lips of E. I believe it was all the same: how she would like a house with a piano: & they mean to retire & buy a house with a piano. She sees flowers, dogs, houses, people with the same quiet, stolid, almost coarse, at any rate dull indifference. Her hands are thick. She has a double chin. She wears a long American looking blueish coat, with a nondescript dowdy scarf, a white blouse, fastened with a diamond lizard oh the colourlessness, drabness, & coldness of her personalityâ€”she whom I used to think arch & womanly & comforting! She is white haired too. Bruce is completely circular: round head, eyes, nose, paunch, mind. You canâ€™t stop him rolling from thing to thing. He never stops, he glides smoothly. It would shock him to mention writing, money, or people. All has to be dissolved in slang & kindliness.

Now the curious thing was that these qualities infected us both to such an extent that we were acutely miserable. I have sometimes felt the same when walking in the suburbs. Castello Avenue made me angry like this once. As for L. he was indignant. That human nature should sink so low, he said; & then that people should lead such aimless evil livesâ€”the most despicable he could imagine. They took the colour, the sting, the individuality out of everything. And to think that I have ever wasted a thought upon what that goodtempered worldly little grocer thought of my writing! But E. is the great disillusionment. Partly on Thobyâ€™s account, partly through my own susceptibility to certain shades of female charm, I had still some glow at the thought of her. Now that glow is replaced by a solid tallow candle. And I feel, this morning, having pitched into bed exhausted, physically worn out, mentally bankrupt, scraped; whitewashed, cleaned. An illusion gone.
