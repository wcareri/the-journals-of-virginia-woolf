### Sunday 17 May

A wire from Raymond in Parisâ€”just read Mrs D. it is quite beautifulâ€”& a very good, outspoken wholly praising review of C.Â R. in the Observerâ€”â€œno living criticâ€ &c. But this is not all vanity; Iâ€™m recording for curiosity: the fate of a book. The only judgment on Mrs D. I await with trepidation (but thats too strong) is Morganâ€™s. He will say something enlightening.

Just back (all my days here begin with this) from Sutton. Oh it is full summer weatherâ€”so hot one canâ€™t walk on the sunny side, & all Londonâ€”even Lavender Hill Lambeth which peels visibly in the sunâ€”transmogrified. We had a bad walk, all along the cinder track, with soft footpaths inviting wh. we could not take, owing to L.â€™s lecture, delivered in a semi-religious sanctuary, with hymns & prayers & a chapter from the Bible. The whole of Sutton was hymning something: soft intense strains of human went warbling about, as I sat; & I was touched & moved by it: the world so beautiful, Godâ€™s gift to us, said the Chairman, who looked poor man as if he had never had an ounce of pleasure in his life. Things become very familiar to me, so that I sometimes think humanity is a vast wave, undulating: the same, I mean: the same emotions here that there were at Richmond. Please have some teaâ€”we shall be hurt if you donâ€™t accept our hospitality. Accordingly we do; & the same queer brew of human fellowship, is brewed; & people look the same; & joke in the same way, & come to these odd superficial agreements, wh. if you think of them persisting & wide spreadâ€”in jungles, storms, birth & deathâ€”are not superficial; but rather profound, I think. We came home on top of a bus all the way for a shilling, with the usual glimpses down lanes, into farmyards, at running streams, persisting in between villas, & behind sunbaked yellow or black motor roads. A little girl on the bus asked her mother how many inches are there in a mile. Her mother repeated this to me. I said you must go to school & theyâ€™ll tell you. But she is at school said her mother. Sheâ€™s seven; & he (the baby on her knee) goes to school. Heâ€™s three. So I gave them two biscuits left over, & the little girl (see my egotism) with her bright excitable eyes, & eagerness to grasp the whole universe reminded me of myself, asking questions of my mother. We saw Lambeth, & I imagined the frolics of clergymen in the boscage, which is very thick; crossed Westminster Bridge; admired the Houses of Parliament & their fretted lacy look; passed the Cenotaph, which L. compromised by sitting with his hat off all the way up Whitehall, & so home, passing a nigger gentleman, perfectly fitted out in swallow tail & bowler & gold headed cane; & what were his thoughts? Of the degradation stamped on him, every time he raised his hand & saw it black as a monkeys outside, tinged with flesh colour within?

Yesterday we had tea with Margaret in her new house. There are three poplars, & behind them St Paulâ€™s. But I donâ€™t want to live in the suburbs again. There we sat, & I teased her, & she me, & she minded a little, & got red & then white, as if her centre were not very firm. She is severe to Lilian, who has the small rooms & is not allowed to plant flowers, she said bitterly, for it worries Margaret, & so nothing is done to the garden, which too worries Margaret. For these worries, she takes Ethel M. Dell & Dickens. Why, she said, should D.s characters be like people, when he can create people?â€”an interesting criticism, I think. We hit it off very well, chiefly owing to my wildness & harum scarumness, I think; & I am very fond of her, & sorry for her, since how awful it would be to â€˜retireâ€™ at 60: to sit down & look at poplar trees? Moreover, she once said she had â€˜compromisedâ€™; her father making entire work impossible; & she now regrets things, I imagine; has seen so little of the world, & carried nothing to the extreme. Lilian irritates too, compared with what she might have had. But, after all, thats enough.

The time is now ripe for dinner. And I must answer some of my admirers. Never have I felt so much admiredâ€”so tomorrow, snubs will snub me back again into trim.
