### Thursday 14 May

The first day of summer, leaves visibly drawing out of the bud, & the Square almost green. Oh what a country dayâ€”& some of my friends are now reading Mrs D. in the country.

I meant to register more of my books temperatures. C.R. does not sell; but is praised. I was really pleased to open the Manchester Guardian this morning & read Mr Fausset on The Art of V.W. Brilliance combined with integrity; profound as well as eccentric. Now if only the Times would speak out thus, but the Times mumbles & murmurs like a man sucking pebblesâ€”did I say that I had nearly 2 mumbling columns on me there? But the odd thing is this: honestly I am scarcely a shade nervous about Mrs D. Why is this? Really I am a little bored, for the first time, at thinking how much I shall have to talk about it this summer. The truth is that writing is the profound pleasure & being read the superficial. Iâ€™m now all on the strain with desire to stop journalism & get on to To the Lighthouse. This is going to be fairly short: to have fatherâ€™s character done complete in it; & mothers; & St Ives; & childhood; & all the usual things I try to put inâ€”life, death &c. But the centre is fatherâ€™s character, sitting in a boat, reciting We perished, each alone, while he crushes a dying mackerelâ€”However, I must refrain. I must write a few little stories first, & let the Lighthouse simmer, adding to it between tea & dinner till it is complete for writing out.

Yesterday was a terrific chatter dayâ€”Desmond on top of Dr Leyes, Lord Olivier on top of Desmond, James & Dadie to finish off with, while L. had I forget how many press interviews & committees into the bargain. The League of Nations is booming (Innes, I mean.) But I meant to describe my dear old Desmond, whom it rejoiced me to see again, & he held out both his hands, & I set him in his chair & we talked till 7 oâ€™clock. He is rather worn & aged; a little, I think, feeling that hereâ€™s 45 on him & nothing achieved, except indeed the children, whom he dotes onâ€”Micky to write, Dermod & Rachel trilling & warbling on flute & piano: all his human relations very fertile & flourishing, but oh, he said, talking of Houseman, donâ€™t let him give up the Corn Exchange & take to literature! I saw him thinking of his 50 articles for 5 years, his welter of old articles lying dusty in boxes, & now Geoffrey Scott promoted to do Donne, which Desmond should have done in the year 1912. I remember him telling me the story at Brunswick Square. So I said I would take the thing in hand & see it through which touched him, for children are not enough, after all; one wants something to be made out of oneself aloneâ€”& 5 boxes of dusty articles are rather raggy & rotten for 45 years. And he praised the C.R. with enthusiasm; & will write on it, & so we chattered along; Vernon Lee, with her cheap rings in exquisite taste; & her idiomatic Italian; & her spiteful way of seeing things, so that she dare not write her memoirs; Lily Langtry coming down the playhouse steps & her daughter looming behind her, loveliness that â€œstruck me in the breastâ€; also Logan & Ottolineâ€”how Alys is ill of the cancer againâ€”â€œa most unhappy miserable life poor womanâ€”â€ L. having the new Mrs B.R. on one side, would be chafed to death by Ott. next door; but like a fool, Logan made none of this clear, & only complained that the village peace of Chelsea would be destroyed by O. wh. naturally she resented. In all this, Desmond acts as solvent & go between, everyone sponging on his good nature & sense. What else did we discuss? The Eâ lizabethans? The Phoenix; poor Ray Litvinâ€™s miserable big mouth, & little body; when L. came, & then the dinner party, I just having time for a race round the Square; both Dadie & James very easy & affable, indeed for Dadie I feel considerable affectionâ€”so sensitive & tender is he, & one of these days will get a pull on himself, & be less of a quicksilver. Indeed, staying on he talked very seriously & excitedly of his dissertation & poets use of words, how they fix on to a word & fill it out with meaning & make it symbolic. But what these scholars want is to get at books through writing books, not through reading them.

But I must remember to write about my clothes next time I have an impulse to write. My love of clothes interests me profoundly: only it is not love; & what it is I must discover.
