Well, Morgan admires. This is a weight off my mind. Better than Jacob he says; was sparing of words; kissed my hand, & on going said he was awfully pleased, very happy (or words to that effect) about it. He thinksâ€”but I wont go into detailed criticism: I shall hear more; & this is only about the style being simpler, more like other peoples this time.

I dined with the Sitwells last night. Edith is an old maid. I had never conceived this. I thought she was severe, implacable & tremendous; rigid in her own conception. Not a bit of it. She is, I guess, a little fussy, very kind, beautifully mannered, & a little reminding me of Emphie Case! She is elderly too, almost my age, & timid, & admiring & easy & poor, & I liked her more than admired or was frightened of her. Nevertheless, I do admire her work, & thats what I say of hardly anyone: she has an ear, & not a carpet broom; a satiric vein; & some beauty in her. How one exaggerates public figures! How one makes up a person immune from oneâ€™s own pleasures & failings! But Edith is humble: has lived in a park alone till 27, & so described nothing but sights & sounds; then came to London, & is trying to get a little emotion into her poetryâ€”all of which I suspected, & think promising. Then how eager she was to write for the Press, which had always been her great ambition, she said. Nothing could be more conciliatory & less of an eagle than she; odd looking too, with her humorous old maids smile, her half shut eyes, her lank hair, her delicate hands, wearing a large ring, & fine feet, & her brocade dress, blue & silver. Nothing of the protester or pamphâ leteer or pioneer seemed in herâ€”rather the well born Victorian spinster. So I must read her afresh. There were Francis, Raymond, Waley & a little American toad called Towne, who soaked himself in liquor & became almost loving to us all. The three Sitwells have considerable breeding about them; I like their long noses, & grotesque faces. As for the house, Osbert is at heart an English squire, a collector, but of Bristol glass, old fashion plates, Victorian cases of humming birds, & not of foxes brushes & deers horns. His rooms are all stuck about with these objects. And I liked him too. But why are they thought daring & clever? Why are they the laughing stocks of the music halls & the penny a liners?

Not much talk; all easy goodnatured generalities after dinner, Francis bawling, Waley sombre & demure, & I very indulgent with my compliments: & now tomorrows Supt & then (here L. came in & told me about R. Macdonald at the Labour party meeting).
