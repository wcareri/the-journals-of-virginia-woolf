### Sunday 19 July

By bringing this book down here to the Studio, I have rather stinted it I think, as my mornings have all been spent writingâ€”Swift or letters. So a whole tribe of people & parties has gone down the sink to oblivionâ€”Ottâ€™s parties & complaints; Gwen Raverat set sturdy dusty grim black, yesterday; Tom hedging a little over the Bank; Sybil Colefax drinking tea & protesting her desire to give up parties; her party when Olga Lynn dropped her music in a rage & had to be pacified by Balfour; & Ott lost her shawl; & the garden was lit like a stage, & Clive & Mary could be seen to the least eyelash; & so home to bed; & Mrs Asquith, Lady Oxford, called me the most beautiful woman in the room, which compliment was repeated to me the next night (so thick have parties been) by Jack Hutch, at Dadieâ€™s, where there were many faces again, & drink, & again home to bed; & then little Eddie Sackville-West & Julian Morrell to dine (& I am to have his piano) & Philip in to fetch her; & then a party at Ottâ€™s with Ching playing the piano; & the news of Hew Andersonâ€™s death there broken to Angus; & Murphy going; & Mrs Cartwright coming; & my booksâ€”oh yes, the Calendar has abused Mrs D. which hurt me a little; & then the tide of praise has flowed over me again, & they both sell well, & my fears were ungrounded; & Maynard has brought us a pamphlet, wh. is called The Economic Consequences of Mr Churchill, & we are having 10,000 printed for Monday week to sell at a shilling.

On Friday I went on a river party & we dined at Formosa, & Eddie played in the round drawing room, & there was George Young in a punt. Not a moments reflection has gone to any of these statements; but I take them together, never knowing what withered straw doesnâ€™t vivify the whole bunch of flowers. They have shone bright & gay this summer in the incessant heat. For the first time for weeks I sit by a fire, but then I am in the thinnest silk dress; & for once, it is watery & windy though I see blue sky through my skylight. A happy summer, very busy; rather overpowered by the need of seeing so many people. I never ask a soul here; but they accumulate. Tonight Ottoline, Tuesday Jack Hutch; Wednesday Edith Sitwell, Friday dine with Raymond. These are my fixed invitations; & all sorts of unforseen ones will occur. I run out after tea as if pursued. I mean to regulate this better in future. But I dont think of the future, or the past, I feast on the moment. This is the secret of happiness; but only reached now in middle age.
