### Monday 4 May

This is the temperature chart of a book. We went to Cambridge, & Goldie said he thought me the finest living critic: the paralysed man, Hayward, said, in his jerky angular way: â€œWho wrote that extraordinarily good article on the Elizabethans 2 or 3 months ago in the Lit. Sup.?â€ I pointed to my breast. Now thereâ€™s one sneering review in Country Life, almost inarticulate with feebleness, trying to say what a Common reader is, & another, says Angus, in the Star, laughing at Nessaâ€™s cover. So from this I prognosticate a good deal of criticism on the ground that Iâ€™m obscure & odd; & some enthusiasm; a slow sale, & an increased reputation. Oh yesâ€”my reputation increases. But I am headachy, & cannot go to a concert with Angus, & Leonard is giving Randall his farewell dinner, & it is a relief to sit quiet (the joy of giving up an engagement is supreme) & I wish I could describe Pernel, Cambridge, Braithwaite & Hayward, with a postscript for Thompson. A lovely place full, like all places, now, of this wave of the past. Walking past the Darwins I noticed the willows; I thought with that growing maternal affection which now comes to me, of myself there; of Rupert; then I went to Newnham, & kindled Mrs Palmer with talk of Pernel marrying an Archbishop.

No, I canâ€™t fire it off; Mrs Asquith sticks in my gizzard; I shall read Moore till dinner, & a paper then again till Leonard comes in. No, I dont want to hear Bach, & by giving Angus the tickets, secured him a charming young man for company.

Pernel was easier than Iâ€™ve ever known her. We sat over her fire, gossipingâ€”how Kate died, taking the dog for a walk till a week of the end; entirely reserved; like a skeleton, like a dead person walking with sarcoma; no doctor. No mention of herself & the 58 brown diaries burnt, I suppose.
