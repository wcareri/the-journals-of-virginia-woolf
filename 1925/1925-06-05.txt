To work off the intense depression left by Desmond. What does this come from? But I have just made this beautiful imageâ€”how he is like a wave that never breaks, but lollops one this way & that way & the sail hangs on ones mast & the sun beats downâ€”& its all the result of dining & sitting talking till 3 in the morning with Elâ izabeth Bibesco, with whom I had tea yesterday. She is a fat housekeeper of a woman, excellent manager, bustling, economical, entirely without nerves, imagination, or sensibility, but what a good housekeeper, how she keeps the books down, & what a good woman of business, how well she would suit an innkeeper, & how she would see to his interestsâ€”entertain his customers with her; sprightly rather broad jokes, standing with her thumbs in her armpits on the other side of the bar, with all her false diamonds flashing, & her little pig eyes, & her broad fat hips & cheeks. This is the spiritual truth about Bibesco: the fact being that she lies in bed, in green crepe de chine, with real diamonds on her fingers, & a silk quilt, & thinks she talks brilliantly to the most intellectual set in Londonâ€”so she does, to Desmond, & Mortimer, & poor Philip Ritchie, & I was half in a rage, having sacrificed my Mozart 5tet to her, from which I should have got gallons of pure pleasure instead of the breakfast cup of rather impure delight. For it had its fun. There was old Asquith in -

And then I was ruffled by Nelly, but got over it, by spending Â£50 of charm. And now I rememberâ€”how fatal this is to remember after a quarrel what one did not sayâ€”how I might have said, If you have Lottie every day, why should I not have my friends? But one canâ€™tâ€”& she is jealous, that is the truth. And next time I will say itâ€”& it was Miss Mayor coming that upset us; â€˜always people when we have dinner partiesâ€. And we had Vita, Edith Sitwell, Morgan, Dadie, Kitty Leafâ€”old Vita presenting me with a whole tree of blue Lupins, & being very uncouth & clumsy, while Edith was like a Roman Empress, so definite clear cut, magisterial & yet with something of the humour of a fishwifeâ€”a little too commanding about her own poetry & ready to dictateâ€”tremulously pleased by Morganâ€™s compliments (& he never praised Vita, who sat hurt, modest, silent, like a snubbed schoolboy).
