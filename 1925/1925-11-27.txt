### Friday 27 November

Oh what a blank! I tumbled into bed on coming backâ€”or rather Ellie tumbled me; & keeps me still prostrate half the day. Next week I shall go to the ballet, my first night out. One visitor a day. Till 2 days ago, bed at 5. So visitors have become as usual, pictures hung on the wall. On the whole, I have not been unhappy; but not very happy; too much discomfort; sickness, (cured by eating instantly); a good deal of rat-gnawing at the back of my head; one or two terrors; then the tiredness of the bodyâ€”it lay like a workmanâ€™s coat. Sometimes I felt old, & spent. Madge died. Rustling among my emotions, I found nothing better than dead leaves. Her letters had eaten away the realityâ€”the brilliancy, the warmth. Oh detestable time, that thus eats out the heart & lets the body go on. They buried a faggot of twigs at Highgate, as far as I am concerned. I drove to the gate, & saw Nessa & Leonard, like a pair of stuffed figures, go in.

My walks are extended to Oxford Street; only once so far; & then what about talks. Vita has been twice. She is doomed to go to Persia; & I minded the thought so much (thinking to lose sight of her for 5 years) that I conclude I am genuinely fond of her. There is the glamour of unfamiliarity to reckon with; of aristocracy (Raymond says, But sheâ€™s half a peasantâ€”) of flattery. All the same, after sifting & filing, much, I am sure, remains. Shall I stay with her? Shall we go to Charleston for Christmas? The best of these illnesses is that they loosen the earth about the roots. They make changes. People express their affection. Nessa wants to have usâ€”Indeed, I have seen more of her & Duncan than for many a day. Gwen comes in: threatens to dissolve, her hearty direct stodgy manner in floods of tears, as if the rivets that hold her must give wayâ€”such tragedies have beaten her, together for the moment; but suddenly she will break down & tell me something that she has not told anyone. She finds me understanding. And I suppose she is in loveâ€”or Marchand in loveâ€”& I donâ€™t altogether want to hear it.

Reading & writing go on. Not my novel though. And I can only think of all my faults as a novelist & wonder why I do itâ€”a wonder which Lytton increases, & Morgan decreases. Morgan is writing an article on me. This may be very helpful. It may shove me off again. Then I want to write â€˜a bookâ€™ by which I mean a book of criticism for the H.P. But on what? Letters? Psychology? Lytton is off: The Loves of the Famous. Q. Elizabeth &c. I thought him at his most intimate last night; all plumy, incandescent, soft, luminous. Something slightly repels (too strong) Leonard. His character is not so good as Morganâ€™s, he said, walking round the square in the snow today. â€œThere is something about all Stracheysâ€”â€ Then, when we talk, L. & I, we rather crab Lyttonâ€™s writing I observe. But all this vanishes, with me, when he comes, as yesterday, to talk, & talk, & talk. That Nessa is still most beautifulâ€”that comes over me. That Ka is thinnerâ€”& very self conscious: but nothing, in my sentimental heart, can stand against these old loyalties. I cannot keep my wits altogether about me in talk. I begin to glitter & englobe people with a champagne mist. And then it fades. I was talking of this to Raymondâ€”whose blunt nose & flashy clothes are, I think, oneâ€™s chief grudge against himâ€”the other day. That there is no substance in ones friendships, that they fade likeâ€”For instance, did he regret Harold in Persia?* like a coin is struck & left for ever in oneâ€™s possession. People die; Madge dies, & one cannot beat up a solitary tear. But then, if 6 people died, it is true that my life would cease: by wh. I mean, it would run so thin that though it might go on, would it have any relish? Imagine Leonard, Nessa Duncan Lytton, Clive Morgan all dead.

** A shrewd guessâ€”he does regret Harold in Persia Nothing â€¦
