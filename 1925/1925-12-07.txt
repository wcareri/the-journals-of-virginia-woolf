### Monday 7 December

I want to lie down like a tired child & weep away this life of careâ€”& my diary shall receive me on its downy pillow. Most children do not know what they cry for; nor do I altogether. It is 12 oâ€™clock on Monday morning, a very cold day, but sunny, healthy, cheerful. Bells ring downstairs; doors are slammed. I should be in full feather, for after all these drowsy dependent weeks I am now almost quit of it again; & can read & write, & walk a little, & mildly entertain. Well, it is partly that devil Vita. No letter. No visit. No invitation to Long Barn. She was up last week, & never came. So many good reasons for this neglect occur to me that Iâ€™m ashamed to call this a cause for weeping. Only if I do not see her now, I shall notâ€”ever: for the moment for intimacy will be gone, next summer. And I resent this, partly because I like her; partly because I hate the power of life to divide. Also, I am vain. Clive will know why Vita did not come to see me. That old rat chased to his hole, there is Tomâ€™s postcard about On Being IIIâ€”an article which I, & Leonard too, thought one of my best: to him characteristic &c: I mean he is not enthusiastic; so, reading the proof just now, I saw wordiness, feebleness, & all the vices in it. This increases my distaste for my own writing, & dejection at the thought of beginning another novel. What theme have I? Shanâ€™t I be held up for personal reasons? It will be too like father, or mother: &, oddly, I know so little of my own powers. Here is another rat run to earth. So now for news.

We shall spend Xmas at Charleston, which Iâ€™m afraid Leonard will not like much. We walked at Hampstead on Saturday. It was very coldâ€”skating everywhere, save there, L. having brought his skates. It had a foggy winter beauty. We went in to Ken Wood (but dogs must be led) & there came to the duelling ground, where great trees stand about, & presumably sheltered the 18th Century swordsmen (how I begin to love the pastâ€”I think something to do with my book) & it was here that we discussed Lytton, gravely, like married people. But my Godâ€”how satisfactory after, I think 12 years, to have any human being to whom one can speak so directly as I to L.! Well, it was a question of Lâ€™s change of feeling. He has the faults of a small nature said L. He is ungenerous. He asks, but never gives. But I have always known thatâ€”often I have seen the dull eyelid fall over him, if one asked a little too much: some sheath of selfishness that protects him from caring too much, or committing himself uncomfortably. He is cautious. He is a valetudinarian. Butâ€”there are, as usual, the other things; & as I say, I have known about Lyttonâ€™s leathern eyelid since I was 20. Nothing has ever shocked me more, I think. But L. said when they were at Cambridge Lytton was not like that to him. First there was the Iâ nternationaâ l Review: & Lytton refused to write; then Ralph; then never a word of praise for other people. Morgan, said Leonard, as we trod back over the slippery hillocks seeing so little as we talked (& yet all this part of Hampstead recalls Katherine to meâ€”that faint ghost, with the steady eyes, the mocking lips, &, at the end, the wreath set on her hair:) Morgan has improved. Morgan is I think naturally more congenial to L. than Lytton is. He likes â€œSilliesâ€; he likes the dependent simplicity of Morgan & myself. He likes settling our minds, & our immense relief at this. Well, well.

I am reading The Passage to India; but will not expatiate here, as I must elsewhere. This book for the H.P.: I think I will find some theory about fiction. I shall read six novels, & start some hares. The one I have in view, is about perspective. But I do not know. My brain may not last me out. I cannot think closely enough. But I canâ€”if the C.R. is a testâ€”beat up ideas, & express them now without too much confusion. (By the way, Robert Bridges likes Mrs Dalloway: says no one will read it; but it is beautifully written, & some more, which L. who was told by Morgan, cannot remember.)

I donâ€™t think it is a matter of â€˜developmentâ€™ but something to do with prose & poetry, in novels. For instance Defoe at one end: E. BrontÃ« at the other. Reality something they put at different distances. One would have to go into conventions; real life; & so on. It might last meâ€”this theoryâ€”but I should have to support it with other things. And deathâ€”as I always feelâ€”hurrying near. 43: how many more books?

Katie came here; a sort of framework of discarded beauty hung on a battered shape now. With the firmness of the flesh, & the blue of the eye, the formidable manner has gone. I can see her as she was at 22 Hâ yde Pâ ark Gâ ate 25 years ago: in a little coat & skirt; very splendid; eyes half shut; lovely mocking voice; upright; tremendous; shy. Now she babbles along.

â€œBut no duke ever asked me, my dear Virginia. They called me the Ice Queen.

And why did I marry Cromer? I loathed Egypt; I loathed invalids. Iâ€™ve had two very happy times in my lifeâ€”childhoodâ€”not when I grew upâ€”but later, with my boys club, my cottage, & my chowâ€”& now. Now I have all I want. My gardenâ€”my dog.â€

I donâ€™t think her son enters in very largely. She is one of these cold eccentric great Englishwomen, enormously enjoying her rank, & the eminence it lends her in St Johnâ€™s Wood, & now free to poke into all the dusty holes & corners, dressed like a charwoman, with hands like one, & finger nails clotted with dirt. She never stops talking. She lacks much body to her. She has almost effused in mist. But I enjoyed it. Though I think she has few affections, & no very passionate interests. Now, having cried my cry, & the sun coming out, to write a list of Christmas presents. Ethel Sands comes to tea. But no Vita.
