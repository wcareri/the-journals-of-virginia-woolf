### Wednesday 29 April

Hastily (Moore waiting) I must record the fact of Tomâ€™s long gaslit emotional rather tremulous & excited visit last night, which informed us of his release (But I have not yet sent in my demission) from the Bank; some heavensent appointment, providing â€œ4/5thâ€™s of my present salaryâ€ & a guarantee, being â€œhumanly speakingâ€ certain, to take effect next Octoberâ€”whether Lady Rothermere (who has become â€˜very niceâ€™) or the 4ly review, he sayeth not. Then he has a house near Sloane Sqre in view, rent Â£58 only, & so hopes to start fresh, & has been thinking over his state these past weeks, being alone, with time on his hands. He has seen his whole life afresh, seen his relations to the world, & to Vivien in particular, become humbler suppler more humaneâ€”good, sensitive honourable man as he is, accusing himself of being the American husband, & wishing to tell me privately (L. gone to fetch the letters) what store V. sets by me, has done nothing but write since last June, because I told her to! He then defended not writing which is her device he said, & went into her psychology. Then he said to L. (having told us that he must space his remarks very carefully to fit in all he had to say) Do you know anything about psycho-analysis? L. said yes, in his responsible way; & Tom then told us the queer storyâ€”how Martin the dr. set V. off thinking of her childhood terror of loneliness, & now she cant let him, Tom, out of her sight. There he has sat mewed in her room these 3 months, poor pale creature, or if he has to go out, comes in to find her in a half fainting state.

â€œTomorrow will be wretchedâ€ he said, for he was now away from 8 to 11. We advised another doctor. But whether its doctors or sense or holiday or travel or some drastic method unknown thats to cure that little nervous self conscious bundleâ€”heaven knows. She has the abstract, he the historic mind he said. The upshot was a queer sense of his emotion in coming to tell us all thisâ€”something not merely touching to my vanity but to my sense of human worth, I think; his liking for us, affection, trust in Leonard, & being so much at his ease in some subconscious way he said, not in conversation, with me, all making me lay my arm on his shoulder; not a very passionate caress, but the best I can do.

And now Iâ€™m a little fidgety about the Common Reader, not a single word of it from a soul, & perhaps a Review in the Lit Sup tomorrow. But this is quite recognisably superficial; beneath my fidgets being considerable stability.
