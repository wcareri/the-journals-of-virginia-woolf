I had an idea for a book last nightâ€”a voyage round the world, imaginary, hunting, climbing, adventurous people, shooting tigers, submarines, flying & so on. Fantastic. Some character: partly the result of L.â€™s saying if we go to America we shd. not make one bite of the cherry but go round the world. Then W.A. Forster said And write an Orlando of your tour.
