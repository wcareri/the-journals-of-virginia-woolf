### Saturday 19 September

And the last few days have been heavenlyâ€”At last some heat; & then, with this book doneâ€”for I donâ€™t feel much anxiety nowâ€”think that John has hit off the cultivated viewâ€”Iâ€™m calm; oh & walk; oh & have to record the horror of 2 bungalows on the top of the hill. Yes. This iniquity is being inflicted on the downs for ever by our â€˜prospective labour candidateâ€™. He shanâ€™t have my vote. I swept off into dreams of a house far away in Dorsetshire. But Oâ€”againâ€”how happy I am: how calm, for the moment how sweet life is with L. here, in its regularity & order, & the garden & the room at night & music & my walks & writing easily & interestedly at Donne of a morning, & poems all about me. Iâ€™ve come to read poetry with intensityâ€”bought Skelton at Tunbridge Wells. For we went to the Easedales one fine hot day & saw the stuffed wolf; & I must now change for Angelicaâ€™s birthday party. George & Margaret yesterday.
