### Sunday 27 September

Lyn & the Kingsley Martins are in the house, & I have crept out here, as I say, to write letters. But talking jangles the nerves at the back of my head. And we had the Easedales too. â€œMr E. was one of those jealous gentlemen, & so he left meâ€. Silence on my part. â€œI was very young, & should have taken a stronger line.â€ â€œHow terrible that a friendship like that should have been broken off!â€ said Joan. And we went round the garden.

Ethel must be in fine feather. General, & I think sincere praise of The Wreckers. I telegraphedâ€”dont want to write. Dottyâ€™s mother dead. Vita going off abroad with her. And we shall publish on 8th in spite of the General Election dont expect sales anyhow.
