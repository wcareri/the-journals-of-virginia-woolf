### Tuesday 29 December

Lytton is, if anything, better. I need not ring up Nessa today, which is a matter of exquisite relief. It seems as if he were now to be seriously ill with ups & downs for some time. They say it is positively not typhoid but ulcerated colon. Well, we have lived through every grade of feelingâ€”how strong, how deepâ€”more than I guessed, though that cavern of horror is well known to me. Soon the whole being can suffer no more: I cant feel anything, I say as I lift the receiver, sitting on Miss Dixeyâ€™s bed & eying with intensity her shining table & the two pale blue wine glasses; the tea caddy; & the gilt framed picture of a Victorian lady. There was also a little pile of books, a few letters, & The Dog World. In these acute states emotions are much simplifiedâ€”there is none of the complexity that I feel this morning about Lytton, when I expect him to recover. I feel annoyance, humour, the desire to laugh with him.

It is a bitter windy morning, & Caburn, when I came in was white with snow. Now it is black. Shall I ever â€˜writeâ€™ again? And what is writing? The perpetual converse I keep up. Iâ€™ve stopped it these 5 or 6 weeks. That excitement, which becomes a habit, is over. Why take to it again? I am dispassionate. Books come gently surging round me, like icebergs. I could write a book of caricatures. Christabelâ€™s story of the Hall Caines suggested a caricature of Country house life, with the red-brown pheasants, Then thereâ€™s Flush: theres the Knock on the door; thereâ€™s the appalling novel; theres Common Reader â€¦ thereâ€™s my little letter to a Poet. But Iâ€™m deficient in excitement; dont feel, as I did after many such illnesses, if I dont write I shall whizz into extinction like an electric globe fused.

That makes me think that our 3 black swans came last night. I will finish this book, & begin another for 1932. And now I have a vast choice of reading matter, & feel no sort of inclination to reply to the flattering invitation of Chatto that they should reprint my books. So Faber wishes too. And L. has sold his 450; & I 9400â€”what figures!
