### Thursday 28 May

Soon after this, I started a headacheâ€”flashes of light raying round my eyes, & sharp pain; the pain cut into me by Ethelâ€™s voice, as she sat telling meâ€”â€œYouâ€™ve got to listenâ€â€”about Adrian Boult, & how he ordered her to leave the room. And then to Rodmell, where the same thing happenedâ€”the light round my eyes, but as I could lie still in bed in my big airy room, the pain was much less. If it were not for the divine goodness of L. how many times I should be thinking of death; always knocked over as I am; but now the recoveries are full of infinite relief. Moreover, on Whit Monday the sun blazed, making the grass semi-transparent. And space & leisure seemed to lie all about; & I said, not once in an exstasy, but frequently & soberly, This is happiness. Why should I feel now calmer, quieter than ever before? Partly my disposition of life; partly Nessa Roger & Clive being away so that I am not hauled about & ruffled. Partly The Waves coming to an endâ€”partlyâ€”I really dont know.

We went to Firle last night & brushed the buttercups on to our shoes, walking through the Park. A lovely country, even counting the villas. At Monks House we had electric light, & the Frigidaire isâ€”today of courseâ€”working. When the electric light fused, we could hardly tolerate Aladdin lamps, so soon is the soul corrupted by comfort. Yesterday men were in the house all day boring holes for electric fires. What more comfort can we acquire? And, though the moralists say, when one has a thing one at once finds it hollow, I dont at all agree. I enjoy my luxuries at every turn, & think them wholly good for what I am pleased to call the soul.

Four young people smashed into Beddingham level crossing gates on Saturday & were cut in pieces by the 9.40 train. One man was found stripped naked, save for the hem of one trouser. Disappointed, reading lightly though, by The man who died, D.Â H.Â L.â€™s last. Reading Sons & Lovers first, then the last I seem to span the measure of his powers & trace his decline. A kind of Guy Fawkes dressing up grew on him it seems, in spite of the lovely silver-bright writing here & there: something sham. Making himself into a God, I suppose.

I am much interrupted again by my wish to write A Knock on the door. For some weeks I have not thought of it. It suddenly forces itself on me, & I go on making up sentences, arguments, jokes &c. Then several people have written to me lately about A Room.
