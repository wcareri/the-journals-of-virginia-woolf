### Tuesday 15 September

I have come up here, trembling under the sense of complete failureâ€”I mean The Wavesâ€”I mean Hugh Walpole doesnâ€™t like itâ€”I mean John L. is about to write to say he thinks it badâ€”I mean L. accuses me of sensibility verging on insanityâ€”I mean I am acutely depressed & already feeling rising the hard & horny back of my old friend Fight fight. Never mind. Here I need not disguise my tumult of feelings. Lord how I hate that Hugh shd. be running about London saying the new V W. is a disappointmentâ€”about nothingâ€”exquisitely written of course. Ought I not then to say that Brace thinksâ€”Oh well, do let me try to give up weighing opposite impressions. Anyhow my mind is crammed with books, & Lord, I tried to speak the truth, bombastic as the remark sounds, wrung it drop by drop from my brain. So essentially I am not horrified. But The Waves, I predict, marks my decline in reputation.
