### Wednesday 1 July

Today Mary & Tommy dine with us & Ottoline comes in afterwards.

We go to Easdaleâ€™s concert at 3. & so on.

Jack, as a wedding gift to Miss Mary Ashton, has stopped, not only my allowance but Nessaâ€™s & Adrianâ€™s.

Our takings, what with the Press & my work, have given me a bonus of Â£860.

And now I must go up & find Ethelâ€™s sentimental & hysterical sheets & underline the most sentimental & hysterical passages for her benefit. Pahâ€”as people say in Shakespeare. And John Bailey is dead, aged 67. (which makes me thinkâ€”no this refers to Jackâ€”that I will read Stendhal de lâ€™Amour).
