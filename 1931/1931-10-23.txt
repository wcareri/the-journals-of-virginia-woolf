### Friday 23 October

Oh but I have been made miserableâ€”damped & disheartenedâ€”this is no exaggerationâ€”because the Lit Sup. only gave half a column of belittlement to After the Deluge. Not that I should have cared more than a moments damn at them for the usual insignificant spiteful methodsâ€”wreaking their politics upon books they dont agree with. But L. saysâ€”& honestly believesâ€”that this puts an end to the bookâ€”Yes he says no less than that. He says his ten years work are wasted, & that he sees no use in going on. His argument is that he wrote this book for the wider public; that this public is at the mercy of Librarians; that librarians take their orders from the Lit Sup; that they judge by the length of the review; that no librarian will advise spending 15/- after this review; so that, however Laski & the experts may applaud, as they do, in the serious weeklies, his book is dead; his work wasted. He remains with a public of experts who are poor; his sales wont reach 500 in 6 months & so on. For my own part I think this a very curious illustration of his psychology. On Sunday he told me that this was bound to happen; yet we have seldom been happierâ€”True he said he expected one col. or one & Â½ of abuse instead of Â½;â€”Oh but the arguments which we have beaten out I daresay for 6 hours, walking in the Sqre, sitting over the fireâ€”utterly cloud my mind. Its his curious pessimistic temper: something deeper than reason, strangling, many coiled, that one cant deal with. Influenza has exactly the same effect, liberating the irrational despondency which I see in all Woolves, & connect with centuries of oppression. The world against us &c. How can one laugh off the Â½ column therefore? And when I say this morning incautiously, â€œIâ€™m reviewed in the Mâ anchester Guardianâ€ L. says â€œIs it a long review?â€ And Isay, feeling like a mother to a hurt & miserable little boy, Yes. Lord what human beings are!

Now it pours; & are we to go to Rodmell?
