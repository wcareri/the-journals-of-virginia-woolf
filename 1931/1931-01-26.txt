### Monday 26 January

Heaven be praised, I can truthfully say on this first day of being 49 that I have shaken off the obsession of Opening the Door, & have returned to Waves: & have this instant seen the entire book whole, & how I can finish itâ€”say in under 3 weeks. That takes me to Feb. 16th; then I propose, after doing Gosse, or an article perhaps, to dash off the rough sketch of Open Door, to be finished by April 1st. (Easter is April 3rd). We shall then, I hope, have an Italian journey: return say May 1st & finish Waves, so that the MS can go to be printed in June, & appear in September. These are possible dates anyhow.

Yesterday at Rodmell we saw a magpie & heard the first spring birds: sharp egotistical, like, A hot sun; walked over Caburn; home by Horley & saw 3 men dash from a blue car & race, without hats across a field. We saw a silver & blue aeroplane in the middle of a field, apparently unhurt, among trees & cows. This morning the paper says three men were killedâ€”the aeroplane dashing to the earth: But we went on, reminding me of that epitaph in the Greek anthology: when I sank, the other ships sailed on.

My memory of todays headlines is this: Gandhi set free. Pavlova to be buried at Golders Green. Ripper murder on Blackheath. Death of Lady St Helierâ€”who was so dâ€”d condescending to me, 30 years ago.
