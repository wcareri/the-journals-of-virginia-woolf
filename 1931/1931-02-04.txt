### Wednesday 4 February

A day ruined, for us both. L. has to go every morning at 10.15 to the Courts, where his jury is still called, but respited always till 10.15 the next day; & this morning, wh. should have dealt a formidable blow at The Wavesâ€”B is within 2 days I think of saying O Deathâ€”was ruined by Elly, who was to have come at 9.30 sharp but did not come till 11. And it is now 12.30, & we sat talking about the period & professional women, after the usual rites with the stethoscope, seeking vainly the cause of my temperature. If we like to spend 7 guineas we might catch a bugâ€”but we dont like. And so I am to eat Bemax &â€”the usual routine.

How strange & wilful these last exacerbations of The Waves are! I was to have finished it at Christmas.

Today Ethel comes. On Monday I went to hear her rehearse at Lady Lewisâ€™s. A vast Portland Place house with the cold wedding cake Adamsâ€™ plaster: shabby red carpets; flat surfaces washed with dull greens. The rehearsal was in a long room with a bow window looking on, in fact in, to other housesâ€”iron staircases, chimneys, roofsâ€”a barren brick outlook. There was a roaring fire in the Adams grate. Lady L. a now shapeless sausage, & Mrs Hunter, a swathed satin sausage, sat side by side on a sofa. Ethel stood at the piano in the window, in her battered felt, in her jersey & short skirt conducting with a pencil. There was a drop at the end of her nose. Miss Suddaby was singing the Soul, & I observed that she went through precisely the same attitudes of ecstasy & inspiration in the room, as in a hall. There were two young or youngish men. Ethelâ€™s pince nez rode nearer & nearer the tip of her nose. She sang now & then; & once, taking the bass, made a cat squalling soundâ€”but everything she does with such forthrightness directness that there is nothing ridiculous. She loses self-consciousness completely. She seems all vitalised; all energised: she knocks her hat from side to side. Strides rhythmically down the room to signify to Elizabeth that this is the Greek melody; strides back; Now the furniture moving begins, she said, referring to some supernatural gambols connected with the prisonerâ€™s escape, or defiance or death. I suspect the music is too literaryâ€”too stressedâ€”too didactic for my taste. But I am always impressed by the fact that it is musicâ€”I mean that she has spun these coherent chords harmonies melodies out of her so practical vigorous, strident mind. What if she should be a great composer? This fantastic idea is to her the merest commonplace: it is the fabric of her being. As she conducts, she hears music like Beethovenâ€™s. As she strides & turns & wheels about to us perched mute on chairs she thinks this is about the most important event now taking place in London. And perhaps it is. Wellâ€”I watched the curiously sensitive, perceptive Jewish face of old Lady L. trembling like a butterflies antennae to the sound. How sensitised to music old Jewesses areâ€”how pliable, how supple. Mrs Hunter sat like a wax figure composed, upholstered, transfixed, with her gold chain purse.
