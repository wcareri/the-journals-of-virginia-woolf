A note. For since The Waves my brain wont stand hard writing-writing that must fetch a compass. Iâ€™m muscularly strained. So I stop my Letter to John & note that The W. has beaten all my books: sold close on 5,000; we are reprinting: so far, save for Hayward & Ethel, no letters. None of my presentees have written. This silence always lasts a week or two. The reviews I think the warmest yet. And so on. But Vita found it desperately dullâ€”anyhow for 100 pages. What shall I say to Virginia? I cant get through it. Up rings Dotty. Cant get through it. Two hours later â€œIâ€™m getting along betterâ€ Still, V. finds it absolutely intellectual: all one person speaking: profound loneliness of the soul; will never like it as much as the others.. Dear me, I spent 20 minutes dashing off a cooks talkâ€”so much I need random rollicking humour. Oh what a grind that was! It comes over me now. Literally I have a pain in my headâ€”but my head has many painsâ€”when I try to stretch another bookâ€”And yet of course I envisage The Tree. But help help, stop stop I cry to my brain. Dont torture me again. Wreckers tonight & supper with Vita, L. & Ethel at the Eiffel Tower afterwards.
