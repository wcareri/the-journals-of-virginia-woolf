### Sunday 27 December

Last nightâ€”I go to Miss Dixeyâ€™s to telephoneâ€”â€œthe improvement continuesâ€. I say this must mean that the stout Strachey constitution has triumphed. For 48 hours L. has been better, & now, Nessa says, realises that he is better, & eats; whatever he is allowed. I am therefore freely imagining a future with my old serpent to talk to, to laugh at, to abuse: I shall read his book on Shâ akespeaâ re; I shall stay at Ham Spray; I shall tell him how L. & I sobbed on Christmas Eve.

But this page is one of my trials to test my brain. If successful I shall go out to the Lodge tomorrow, light my electric fire, & potter about. I am cross with Desmond, for talking about dreaming subjectivity & The Waves; I have been making phrases about his damnable tepidityâ€”he who neither loves nor hatesâ€”in short Iâ€™m in a healthy condition. And it is, remarkably, April the First. L. cant come in. Iâ€™ve been pacing the terrace. The sun is flooding the downs. The leaves of the plant in the window are transparent with light. My brain will be filling. We shall go to Lewes tomorrow. All is again released, though I shall have some trepidation about the telephone. Lunching with the Keynes, they took Lytton philosophically. â€œIs he alive?â€ Lydia asked. She had 3 helps of turkey. Maynard said that Lyttonâ€™s last relations had been very thin. He was not sure when he saw him last. He was not really changed; nothing of importance had happened. They did not go to Ham Spray because Lydia disapproves of the immorality of Carrington. She is a dog in the manger. The relationships are hypocritical.

And what dâ€™you feel about immortality, Maynard? I asked. â€œI am an idealist,â€ said Maynard, â€œ& therefore on the whole I suppose I think that something may continue. Clearly the brain is the only exciting thingâ€”matter does not exist. It follows thereforeâ€¦. but one is very vague.â€ So, more or less, he said. And L. said death was stupid like a motor accident. And M. said that Mrs Courtauld was dying, might be dead that moment. And he wished one cd. die at once: there should be death arranged for couples simultaneously, like himself & Lydia, me & Leonard. But he always supposed he would die before Lydia, & I, I said, before Leonard. Then Lydia & Leonard will marry. They will combine all these dogsâ€”(dogs were wandering about.) And so home. And I kissed Maynard. And they are coming to tea. I can write so far, if it is to be called writing, not an effusion of this old pen, without racing or pain.

But when it comes to the screwâ€”the screw that I give, & Desmond doesnâ€™tâ€”
