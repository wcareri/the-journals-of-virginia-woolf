### Tuesday 1 September

And so a few days of bed & headache & overpowering sleep, sleep descending inexorable as I tried to read Judith Paris, then Ivanhoe. A note on Judith Paris: its a London museum book. Hugh bouncing with spurious enthusiasmâ€”a collection of keepsakes bright beadsâ€”unrelated. Why? No central feeling anywhereâ€”only â€œIâ€™m so vitalâ€”so bigâ€”so creativeâ€. True, its competent enough, spare in the wordingâ€”but words without roots. Yes thats it. All a trivial litter of bright objects to be swept up.

Scott: a note. A pageant. And I know the man (I forget his name) will hit the mark. So Iâ€™m not excited. Almost incredible that my father shd. have taken this scene seriously. But I think some roots. A perfectly sincere desire surely to amuse, now & then ruffled (but oh how seldom!) by some raid from the sub-consciousâ€”only in the humour tho. Rowena, Rebecca, hairdressers ornamentsâ€”Madame Tussaud sham jewels. Its the design thats interestingâ€”all flat, daubed. But I think I trust him & like him, better than Hugh. Question of morality. That we are all moralists; with a temporary standard. My anger that Sâ . wont be more intense partly the result of Englandâ€™s crisis this summer, (if summer it can be called).

Man came this morning when I was in my night gown to put up Nessaâ€™s tiles in the top room. L. in London. Joyceâ€™s birthday. Hot still September morning. Rooks gathering, cawing
