### Monday 9 March

And then I went, more than a week ago to Lady Roseberyâ€™sâ€”blank sealit room, buffet, elderly butlers or peers. Lady R. young & shorn. Lord Revelstoke exemplary. Caviare. Lady Oxford. A curious fierce, dart in her eye: strung; pinioned. I knew your father: your mother.. &c. Is to come to tea. Wants me to write about her book. Sense of drum & blare: of Ethelâ€™s remorseless fangs: her irresistible vanity, & some pang too for her childâ€™s craving for a partyâ€”how tawdry how paltry: her facing out the failure of The Prison; her desperate good cheer; her one bouquet; her old battered wigged head. How mixed my feelings wereâ€”& how exhausted & windswept & disillusioned I wasâ€”with my ears ringing, & no warmth depth comfort slippers & ease anywhere: but all effort & strain: & the sense of the futility of it all.
