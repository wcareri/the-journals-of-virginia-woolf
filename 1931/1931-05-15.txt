### Friday 15 May

But it is a happy life. Those rules I made have so far kept my week orderly. Yesterday I went to Mrs Hunterâ€™s sale, & before I had been in the room 5 minutes had bought through Mr Marchment of Shepherds Bush a large old rosewood & satinwood secretaire for Â£6.16. Heavens! The wood alone was worth that. It was a sordid, emulative, exciting, depressing scene. The trade was there in force. Jews, smoking pipes. Many winks & nods interchanged. Poor old Mrs Hunterâ€™s little odds & ends were peered at & snatched; everybody seemed to be finding out flaws, & offering the least money. Marchment kept saying to me â€œBuy itâ€”buy itâ€”itâ€™ll grow into moneyâ€. Thus solicited I did buy a shawl for 35/- & a little cabinet for Â£3.15. This I regretted; & I let slipâ€”oh never mind. One must take these bargains & slips philosophically, in order to attain the perfectly buoyant & energised life which is now my aim. O yes, I dont waste a moment: I am always on the hop, with so much licence too allowed for sheer frivolity. Most plans of life are far too strict. I allow a liberal margin for pleasure.

The faces of Mrs H.â€™s rich friends disgusted me. Nothing is quite so coarse, cruel, meaningless, & sensual as a fashionable womanâ€™s face, who is about 50: has done nothing but scavenge about London in cars; eating & drinking; marrying; coveting, tittle tattling. The Smyth-Hunter circle centres I think round the shires; the golf courses; the purlieus of the Bath Club & Whites. They are horsey, dressy; but not aristocratic, not distinguished. They are very well off; but lose money largelyâ€”or so at least I diagnose them. But their philosophy requires them to take tumbles bravely. When we went in on Friday to look at the things, Mrs H. was sitting at the desk which I want to buy, as cool & self-possessed as if she were giving a house warming, instead of seeing all her possessions, beds & blankets, paper knives & pen trays, all go for two or three shillings. â€œI see you so seldom. Do sit down for a moment & talk!â€ And what was I to say, to a woman old enough to be my mother, in that predicament?
