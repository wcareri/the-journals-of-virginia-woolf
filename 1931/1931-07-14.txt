### Tuesday 14 July

It is now twelve oâ€™clock on the morning of July 14thâ€”& (Bob has come in to ask me to sign a paper to get Palmer a pension. Bob says â€¦ mostly about his new house, washing basins, can he use a candle still to go to bed with, Bessy is moving in today, he is off to Italy for a month, will I send a copy of my new book to Count Morra, all Italians are Counts, once he showed four Counts round Cambridge, Palmer â€¦ & so on: shuffling from foot to foot, taking his hat off & putting it on again, moving to the door & returning. O & about Desmondâ€™s book. Desmond stole some of the articlesâ€”Putnam wrote him a very severe letterâ€”)

& I had meant to say that I am now (here Nelly comes in with a bill for 4/6 to pay for my shoes)

I had meant to say that I have just finished correcting the Hampton Court scene (This is the final correction, please God.)

But my Waves account runs, I think, as follows:â€”

I began it, seriously about September 10th 1929:  
I finished the first version on April 10th 1930  
I began 2nd version May 1st 1930.  
I finished 2nd version Feb. 7th 1931  
I began to correct the 2nd version May 1st 1931 finished 22nd. June. 1931  
I began to correct the typescript 25th June 1931  
Shall finish. (I hope.) ~~28 June~~ 18th July.â€”

Then remain only the proofs.
