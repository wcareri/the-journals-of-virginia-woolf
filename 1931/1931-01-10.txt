### Saturday 10 January

Rather stirred by reading my own essay on Poetry in Fiction I write here instead of breaking my back over Dante. (Its true, I get more thrill from Dante, read after an hours Waves, than from almost any readingâ€”hence the effort). And Clive is looking in for 5 minutes to say good bye. â€œAnd to see how you areâ€ he says. â€œAnd how are you?â€ I say. â€œBlindâ€ he says, rather dolefully. Such is the state of our relationship at 10 to 6 on Saturday Jan. 10th 1931. Lord lord, what a queer thing life is!

We walked through the little dingy streets of Seven Dials Leonard & I this afternoon, to Charing Cross Road. What a mood of tears I was inâ€”of pathos, for Leonard, for myself; & said to him Would you like half a crown to buy a squirrel? Suddenly one is overcome with sorrow for people.

But to be connectedâ€”Lehmann may do: a tight aquiline boy, pink, with the adorable curls of youth; yes, but persistent, sharp. Shall I be paid if I come as apprentice? Can I have the Hogarth Press books? Not much atmosphere; save perhaps that his eyes are imaginative: Lord knows. And we ask 4 or 5 thousand as his share.

Now those figures have driven away my stir & the spirit of delight, whose wings were brushing me. in spite of our solid middleclass household (servants again) & over cooked meat.

I think a little Dante is indicatedâ€”Canto XXVI.
