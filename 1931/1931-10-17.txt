More notes on The Waves. The sales, these past 3 days have fallen to 50 or so: after the great flare up when we sold 500 in one day, the brushwood has died down, as I foretold. (Not that I thought we should sell more than 3,000). What has happened is that the library readers cant get through it & are sending their copies back. So, I prophesy, it will now dribble along till we have sold 6000 & then almost die, yet not quite. For it has been received, as I may say, quoting the stock phrases without vanity, with applause. All the provinces read enthusiastically. I am rather, in a sense, as the Mâ€™s would say, touched. The unknown provincial reviewers say with almost one accord, here is Mrs Woolf doing her best work; it cant be popular; but we respect her for so doing; & find The Waves positively exciting. I am in danger, indeed, of becoming our leading novelist, & not with the highbrows only. To show how slow a book it is, not only do Vita & Dotty find the first 100 pages boring in the extreme, but I have as yet (10 days after publication) had only 3 letters about it. Nessaâ€™s enthusiasm is the brightest spot. And, to annotate further, the lack of sales has had the providential effect of steadying & quieting me, so that I can get back to work, & have already lost the flush & flutter of what seemed like complete success. So now, what shall I work at? So many works hover over me.
