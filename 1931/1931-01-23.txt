### Friday 23 January

Too much excited, alas, to get on with The Waves. One goes on making up The Open Door, or whatever it is to be called. The didactive demonstrative style conflicts with the dramatic: I find it hard to get back inside Bernard again.

The speech took place; L. I think slightly exacerbated: an interesting observation if a true one. Two hundred people; well dressed, keen, & often beautiful young women. Ethel in her blue kimono & wig. I by her side. Her speech rollicking & direct: mine too compressed & allusive. Never mind. Four people wish the speeches printed. Naturally I am rather used upâ€”cant make the effort this morning of going on with The Waves. And am 99: & get headaches very easilyâ€”Lord, how often this drains my last chapters of their strength! And now Open Door is sucking at my brain too. Such accidents cant be avoided.

Vita last night: â€œIf I, who am the most fortunate of women, can ask What is life for?, how can other people live at all?â€ in a vague mood of depression. She says she gets more pain than pleasure from praise of her books, which I believe to be true. Never was there a more modest writer. And yet she makes Â£74 in a morningâ€”I mean a cheque drops in for a story.
