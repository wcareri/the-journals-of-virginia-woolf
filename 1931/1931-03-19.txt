### Thursday 19 March

Ethel yesterday, very uneasy about her character; & possible misrepresentations. I think deluding herself about her own motives in countering reviewers: (purely for the sake of other musicians, women in particular: Iâ€™ve nothing to lose: have suffered neglect &c all my life). I think uneasy about her own greatness, requiring assurance, & snatching it rather hastily from such vague remarks as I could make â€œThats just what I wanted you to sayâ€â€”she plays a losing game very gallantly. â€œBut I detest Bohemianism. I want fresh air, above everything. Therefore I took care to afficher myself. I was the friend of the Empress. The Ambassador was an old friend of mine. I couldnâ€™t afford to be dÃ©classÃ©e. Couldnâ€™t have borne it (about her standing in Roman society).

It seems possible to me that nature gave her everything except the power of expression in music: hence the race & violence & restlessness of her nature: the one outlet is stopped up. And she for ever batters at the door; it remains locked; she flows away over me, Lady Cunardâ€”whoever it may be with the vehemence of a tortured & baffled spirit. But she would die rather than allow this. Hence her terrific egotism: her insatiable desire for praise, since she is denied the only true satisfaction. An exhausting companion, therefore.

Christabel last night.

I put Leonard higher than anybody hereâ€”above you, who are above the rest.  
My fourth child is not by my husband.

Why these candours & confessions?  
She did not like me, or trust me, last night
