But we are not to live & die in 47. The Bedford Estate wont house a publisher; would create a precedent; vans would stop at the door. Unexpectedly complaisant, though, Mr Upton told us that we may stay on here past our term: the side of the Sqre is to be pulled down; but times are bad for building; & they will treat us with consideration. So we stay on, anyhow this next year. With John doubtful (I murmur this in secret) it is wisest so: & Lord, how I love the chance of any escapeâ€”from what? to what?

Iâ€™m disoriented; have been to the City & seen St Bartholomewâ€™s. Came back to wait Vita. Vita has to take Dotty to a nursing home, so cant come; my evening spoiltâ€”mind cant settle. Whats to become of Lottie, still out of a place? Nessa rings up. Will Clive have her? I am reading Cliveâ€™s book.

Here I will give myself the pleasureâ€”shall I?â€”of copying a sentence or two from Morganâ€™s unsolicited letter on The Waves:â€”

â€œI expect I shall write to you again when I have re-read The Waves. I have been looking in it & talking about it at Cambridge. Its difficult to express oneself about a work which one feels to be so very important but Iâ€™ve the sort of excitement over it which comes from believing that oneâ€™s encountered a classicâ€

I daresay that gives me more substantial pleasure than any letter Iâ€™ve had about any book. Yes, I think it does, coming from Morgan. For one thing it gives me reason to think that I shall be right to go on along this very lonely path. I mean in the city today I was thinking of another bookâ€”about shopkeepers, & publicans, with low life scenes; & I ratified this sketch by Morganâ€™s judgment. Dadie agrees too. Oh yes, between 50 & 60 I think I shall write out some very singular books, if I live. I mean I think I am about to embody, at last, the exact shapes my brain holds. What a long toil to reach this beginningâ€”if The Waves is my first work in my own style!

To be noted, as curiosities of my literary history: I sedulously avoid meeting Roger & Lytton whom I suspect do not like The Waves. I suspect that it is dubbed a failure also by Ottoline, Colefax, Mary, & Christabel. Lord David does not care for it, nor Hugh Walpole. I sit tight here in my fastness, only sedulously avoiding any meeting with Roger & Lytton. Why do I imagine that they are both hostile towards me, because of The Waves? It is unlikelyâ€”No; I disliked Lytton for writing Q. Eth. I remember.

But oh the happiness of this lifeâ€”

I was thinking to myself today, few people in Cheapside can be saying â€œIt is too good to be trueâ€”that L. & I are going to dine alone tonight.â€ Then of course, for no reason, L. is rather silent & sad at tea; Vita does not come; I cant get on with Philip Sidney; & so my perfect crystal globe has a shadow crossing it. L. is now printing; & perhaps dinner will be all I planned. And if its not, my happiness is too substantial to be tarnished. 

But dinner was very good.

I am working very hardâ€”in my way, to furbish up 2 long Elizabethan articles to front a new Common Reader: then I must go through the whole long list of those articles. I feel too, at the back of my brain, that I can devise a new critical method; something far less stiff & formal than these Times articles. But I must keep to the old style in this volume. And how, I wonder, could I do it? There must be some simpler, subtler, closer means of writing about books, as about people, could I hit upon it.

The Waves has sold more than 7,000. The Deluge is selling very well)

Theres always somebody playing a concertina if one has the window open at the backâ€”a kind of bagpipe concertina. That reminds me, I scribble a page of what is called, I think, Diary or Calendar every morning, before setting to upon Harvey, in which I catch such reflectionsâ€”& shall one day publish them in a square grey-papered covered volume, very thin: a kind of copy book, with a calendar of the month stamped upon it.
