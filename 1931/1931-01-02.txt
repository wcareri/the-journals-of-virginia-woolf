### Friday 2 January

This is the turn of the tide. The days are lengthening. Today was fine from start to finishâ€”the first we have had, I think, since we came. And for the first time I walked my Northease walk & saw the moon ride at 3, pale, very thin, in a pure blue sky above wide misty flattened fields, as if it were early on a June morning.

Here are my resolutions for the next 3 months; the next lap of the year.

First, to have none. Not to be tied  
Second, to be free & kindly with myself, not goading it to parties: to sit rather privately reading in the studio.  
To make a good job of The Waves.  
To care nothing for making money.

As for Nelly, to stop irritation by the assurance that nothing is worth irritation: if it comes back, she must go.

Then not to slip this time into the easiness of letting her stay. Thenâ€”well the chief resolution is the most importantâ€”not to make resolutions. Sometimes to read, sometimes not to read. To go out yesâ€”but stay at home in spite of being asked. As for clothes, I think to buy good ones.

This morning Sandies brought Miranda, & she is now stood in her alcove. We went over to Charleston yesterday, & I fought, rather successfully with the usual depression. Is it their levity?â€”a sneer? But nothing so bad as usual. Duncan there. We came in, & the scene had the usual red cave effectâ€”red cave in the profound winter hollow.
