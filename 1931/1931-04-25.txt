### Saturday 25 April

Angouleme. Fair, concours agricole braying: a loudspeaker too under a vast blue & yellow cardboard tower, higher than this hotel, on wh. is written Huiles et Tourbeaux: they sell ices at a little opening. We have been to the concours: saw dogs: Belgian hares; mechanical saws; bees in hives. Then walked, in high wind & black clouds, round battlements. Slightly reminded me of Cliftonâ€”high airy terraces, overlooking breadths of cloud darkened country. Girls drinking port & eating cakes in ThÃ© Salon.

Before this, we went to Castillon: an adventure, driving on narrow country roads, further south than Brantome. Arrived late. Asked for dinner at Boule dâ€™Or. Walked by the Dordogneâ€”of majestic breaâ dâ th, empty like all France, save for one racing boat. We slept here very well in soft warm beds, though there was no hot water & the cold was so great we had to go to bed. Next day was fine & warm. I went into the Church; after the school children had left. I always wonder at the immense fund of ancient piety, dragging these blocks into mere villages. Lovely spring day. Drove 7 or 8 miles to Montaigne. Rang at Castle door. No one came. Women tending cows in ancient stables. A tower at one end. A garden with flowering trees. The usual renovated peaked & black tiled Chateau: over the door Que Sâ€™cais-jeâ€”A woman came. Took us up narrow stone steps, worn; opened thick nail studded door. This is his bedroom; this is his dressing room. Here he died. Here he went downâ€”he was very smallâ€”to Chapel. Upstairs again is his library. The books & furniture are at Bordeaux. Here is his chair & table. He wrote those inscriptions on the beams. Sure enough it was his room; a piece of an old wooden chair might be his. A circular tower, very thick; 3 small windows looking along the wall to another tower. All that remains of the fire wh. burnt the old Chateau in 1880â€”or thereabouts. We wandered on the terrace. Saw the vineyards below; the shaped reddish hills & terraces: one or two brooding brown farmsâ€”much his viewâ€”the curious musing man must have halted to look at what we saw. So lovely now; as then. Americans &c. Every day of the year the woman said. A dog went with us fetching a chestnut & putting it on the parapet to be thrown. So on, through lovely shaped fields, like the south, but subtler, to Bergerac, where we had our bestâ€”our only good meal L. says. Indeed when the novelty is gone, the food is ranker & commoner & less interesting than I remembered; save for this lunch; off Monbazillac wine; pÃ¢te; eggs & so on.

To Perigueux: old furniture shops: expensive chairs: a church with green domes; scraped; renewed. All worshippers are old women; all in black; all woollen; decrepit. A random priest ambling along with different gestures. Tomâ€™s religion. (I must read his Lambeth tonight, having read myself almost out of books). So to BrantÃ´meâ€”in the evening sun. Man felling poplar in a flat meadow: boy fishing; a ring & loop of waters under old bridges; smoky cave dwellings lived in since Charlemagne. Cheap, clean, elementary Innâ€”no. Letters. Kauffer. Ethel. Vitaâ€”about my bibliography: papers: Nessa at Okehampton in floods; determined that England is intolerableâ€”Children so excited she cant give up the tour.

Walk yesterday. Forgot the size of maps. Found Champagnac beyond us. Went wrong at Les Roches. Arrived at an old house on a green sward, with trees & walled garden. O to live here, we said. So much subtler, gentler, lovelier than Cassis. The land is flat & green as a lawn; with elongated quivering poplars just fledged; then the spade pressed hills I love; & the river, by which we walkedâ€”the river so deep, so romantic, taking the blue thunder clouds, the willows, twisting them nonchalantly, flowing on. Clumps of purple gentian in the reeds. An Elizabethan meadowâ€”cowslips, bluebells. But the thunder roared out. We ran. We sheltered under a ruined cave of some sort. Then dashed home 2 miles of road or more; thighs aching; thunder & lightning at Cemetery. All the tin shelters & metal wreaths gleamed. Girls, mourners, took arms & ran. Home before the main shower, very heavy.

Fair. All the women in black with kids & sheep. Pens of pigs. Man said his sister in law said fish cheaper in Paris. Clerks from the Societe Generale for lunch. One black literary man. The other very southern; mobileâ ; talked about cars.
