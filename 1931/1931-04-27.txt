### Monday 27 April

Cloud of Sunday lifted; but heavy in the skies. Drove over high ground to Chinon; showery: a discreet charming grey & white town. Got our letters. Pleasant to be asked to wire about making a speech; & know one cant answer. A first rate lunchâ€”one of our great successes. No comparison with White Hart at Lewes possible. Climbed the steep path to Castle. Tapped at door. Went away relieved. No woman summoned us back. Explored castle alone as usual. Not a single tourist, & only 3 English the whole tour. Saw the high unroofed room in wh. Jeanne stood before the King. The very chimney piece perhaps. Walls cut through by thin windows. Suddenly one looks down, down on roofs. How did the middle ages get through the evenings? A stone crypt in wh. J. lived: people carve their names everywhere. River silken serpentine beneath. Liked the stone roofless rooms; & the angular cut windows. Sat on the steps to hear 2 struck by the clock wh. has rung since the 13th Century: wh. J. heard. Rusty toned. What did she think? Was she mad? a visionary coinciding with the right moment. Drove on; showers; cold; bad roads; never mindâ€”cheerful enough, till we landed at Chateau le-noir hoping for a small country Inn. Women holding the ends of sheets in the hall. Perpetual washing & ironing at hotels. Small child in Bureau playing with paper. Good dinner of its kind. Then the Movies began in the courtyardâ€”talk & laughing till 12.30 or so. This damp place did its best to rejoiceâ€”valiantly, unfortunately for us. And bad breakfast in the public room, smelling of wine. So off: the day cold, but rather brighter. They call this La lune Rousse. They say it happens every year. Whether red or Russian I dont know.

So to Le Mans. Another grey & white curved, dignified, flat windowed ancient town. Letters. The Cathedral. Bought umbrellas; pen tray; lunched. The tournedos underdone & expensive. Very little good meat in town restaurants I should say; at Chinon, though, whatever it wasâ€”duck I thinkâ€”excellent. Here not much to pit against the White Hart Lewesâ€”our staple comparison. In this great argument I am always for France; L. for England. Expense seems higher than 3 years ago. I voted for Dreux; so we went thereâ€”to Hotel de Paradis; & coming in heard the violins, & saw thinly dressed girls; cheap; rigged out in ready mades from the local shop. A wedding. Dancing already at 5.30. This is the Inn that has old cupboards. Had to dine across the yard, as the dining room was danced in. Strawberries for dinner. An ice; but remembering A. Bennett, refused it. All very slow & cold. People driving up in cars all the time. Little boys scampering about in black velvet. Small girl perfectly dressed & very prim. Whole families invited: small business people I imagine. The dancing went on till 11. Then we saw the wretched waiters carrying tables acrossâ€”how cynical all waiters must be & chambermaidsâ€”how terribly aware of the transitoriness of lifeâ€”& the music stopped. They ate. Then at 12 or 1 (I was woken) cars began tuning up: people shouting, laughing saying goodbye. I had seen the bride dancingâ€”a pale girl in spectaclesâ€”& thought of her borne off to fulfil her duties in some small suburban house outside Dreux, for she was marrying a clerk I should think: & they now begin to replenish the race.

This morning was our finest. I put on my shady hat & left off my jersey. So did L. And I was cajoled into considering seriously a desk; Â£10: then stopped in Nonancourt: found a gigantic old furniture shopâ€”cultivated man in knee breeches well cutâ€”sportingâ€”a connoisseurâ€”too awareâ€”perhaps shall buy a bed. Then lunched at our Claraâ€™s Bois Joliâ€”my word! A chateau furnished each room in its own period; a chicken turned over the fire on a spit; old custom; pretty maids in pretty dresses; the usual fake; amusing; American; she said of the cowslips â€œLook at these baby primrosesâ€”arent they cute?â€ How I hate foreigners bad French. Our lunch admirable: but cost Â£1.10. This is Claraâ€™s idea of heaven. Not mine. A glorified Drusillaâ€™s teashop. Sickened me of old French furniture. Lovely as they are, things lose infinitely from being preserved not used. The sham, & the effort to tickle our vanity & feed on our money disagreeable. Lots of ancient summer houses & Skittles. An old caleche the most pleasant thingâ€”rolled off with some rubbish in a doorwayâ€”18th Century. So here: Caudebec: & the weather is now (our last day) set fine. So be it.
