And Miss Holtby says â€œIt is a poem, more completely than any of your other books, of course. It is most rarely subtle. It has seen more deeply into the human heart, perhaps, than even To the Lighthouseâ€¦â€ & though I copy the sentence, because it is in the chart of my temperature, Lord, as I say, that temperature which was deathly low this time last week, & then fever high, doesnâ€™t rise: is normal. I suppose Iâ€™m safe; I think people can only repeat. And Iâ€™ve forgotten so much. What I want is to be told that this is solid & means something. What it means I myself shant know till I write another book. And Iâ€™m the hare, a long way ahead of the hounds my critics.
