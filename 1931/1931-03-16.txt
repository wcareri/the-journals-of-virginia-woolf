### Monday 16 March

These few & rather exacerbated entries show, I think, the back wash of The Waves. I am writing little articles of a morning, & should have been sketching the Houses of the Great this moring, but that I have not the material. This afternoon I shall try to see Carlyleâ€™s house & Keatsâ€™ house. Tomorrow I lunch with George & Margaret to meet the Rothensteins. Miss Holtby is writing a book on me. So we go on, until, with the sun out & the birds singing as I hope, we end this lap of the year with 3 weeks holiday. Iâ€™m ready this year for holiday. I think indeed that I have seldom worked harder, one way & another. Emotionally there has been the slight perpetual restraint with Nelly; & one fine blaze, about Lady Roseberyâ€™s party with Ethelâ€”that valiant truculent old mosstrooper of a woman. She is so gritty to be brother with. And I respect her capacity for ignoring me. She took to reading Dean Inge, she says, when she assumed from my voiceâ€”exhausted, cold & gruffâ€”that â€˜all was over.â€™ Her strength of feeling is her power over one. This drives her headlong. Her Press has been catcallingâ€”whistling. Never mind. She has other schemes on foot at once. A curious problemâ€”what she minds, what she thinks, about her music. She descends to explanations in Time & Tide which seem deplorably low down. No, I cannot write this morning.

Barbara, Julian & Betty Jenkins the other nightâ€”Julian in a stew about his poems. And so my quiet weekend at Rodmell next week will be spent discussing Pope &c. How I grudge itâ€”& yet cant deny the young. Ann Toby Henderson & I go to Tantivy Towers. But enough of this moping & groping.

There is no doubt that a low mood, betokening dispiritment is more enlivening to our friends than one blown with triumph & success:â€”
