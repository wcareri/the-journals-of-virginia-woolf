### Friday Xmas morning

Lytton is still alive this morning. We thought that he could not live through the night. It was a moonlit night. Nessa rang up at 10 to say that he has taken milk & tea after an injection. When she went to Hungerford yesterday they were in great despair sitting round. He had taken nothing for 24 hours & was only half conscious. This may be the turn, or may mean nothing. We are lunching with the Keynesâ€™. Now again all oneâ€™s sense of him flies out & expands & I begin to think of things I shall say to him, so strong is the desire for lifeâ€”the triumph of life.

A soft misty morning.

After writing the last page, Nov. 16th, I could not go on writing without perpetual headache; & so took a month lying down; have not written a line; have read Faust, Coningsby &c. & seen Clive, Christabel, Nessa, Miss Bowen, Alice Ritchie: until the last 14 days, when I heard about Lytton. He has been ill a month. I have lived through again all grades of feeling: then the telephone; then Angelica coming; then going to see James; then coming here last Tuesday, a dark drive, a tree reminding me of Lytton. Brighton yesterday. All very quiet, misty; a blue sky & white clouds last night. Talk to L. last night about death: its stupidity; what he would feel if I died. He might give up the Press; but how one must be natural. And the feeling of age coming over us: & the hardship of losing friends; & my dislike of the younger generation; & then I reason, how one must understand. And we are happier now.
