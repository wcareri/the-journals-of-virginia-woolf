And I feel us, compared with Aldous & Maria, unsuccessful. Theyâ€™re off today to do mines, factories .. black country; did the docks when they were here; must see England. They are going to the Sex Congress at Moscow, have been in India, will go to America, speak French, visit celebrities,â€”while here I live like a weevil in a biscuit. The fog thickens. My electric lamp is broken; (because we are having fires put in). Lord, how little Iâ€™ve seen, done, lived, felt, thought compared with the Huxleysâ€”compared with anyone. Here we toil, reading & writing, year in year out. No adventure, no travel; darker grows the fog. Here, by some invisible rope, we are bound. Add to this my gnats perception of filamentary relations. With Nessa for example. I think she plumes & prides herself: I think she exists self sufficient: I think her beauty is praised; I think she does not want me; I think a million things a minute. My boasts do me harm. My reality is unknown. So I go onâ€”this is the truck of The Waves. My ship has sailed on. I toss among empty bottles & bits of toilet paper. O & the servants: Lottie. Mrs M. Nelly comfortably installed for life.

And I am to write 6 articles straight off about what? And a story. About what? All I like is my own capacity for feeling. If I werent so miserable I could not be happy. And the Huxleys are now approaching Chesterfield, where they will interview managers. Aldous takes life in hand. Whether that damages his writing I dont know. He is â€˜modernâ€™. He is endlessly athletic & adventurous. He will be able to say he did not waste his youth. Some bitterness is the goad which drives him on. Death comes; nothing matters; at least let me see all that there is to be seen, read all there is to be read. I fancy no one thing gives him the immense satisfaction things give me. Thats all the comfort I find.
