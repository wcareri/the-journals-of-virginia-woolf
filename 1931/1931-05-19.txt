A quarter of an hour:â€”yes, & what to say in a quarter of an hour. Lyttonâ€™s book: very good. Thats his line. The compressed yet glowing account which requires logic, reason, learning, taste, wit order & infinite skillâ€”this suits him far better, I think than the larger scale, needing boldness, originality, sweep. Iâ€™m delighted too, to have an argument in favour of writing v. non-writing. Compare with Lawrence. These things wont tarnish & drop & let fall their petals. They hint at force; at reserve; at the strength to leave things unsaid; the strength required not to preach; not to extemporise. Like Max, though, a small talent sedulously cultivated. And I respect that. But I dont respect Logan. I loathe the vulgarity, the fribbery & frivolity of Logan (afterthoughts).

Lytton & Raymond to dinner tonight. Desmond tâ€™other night. He needs Â£300. Cant handle his bookâ€”makes excuses for leaving it with us. Much obliterated in the struggle for life.

Mrs Hunt Hueffer: â€œI dont remember names after my illness. But I heard my mother talking to old Mr Black as I went upstairs. I did not know what it meantâ€”intimate relationsâ€”at the time, afterwards I found outâ€ as she has, Hugh says, with diverse people: perhaps Hugh; who winced at her name. William also (our first black hole) about his book: rather a disappointmentâ€”an Episode.
