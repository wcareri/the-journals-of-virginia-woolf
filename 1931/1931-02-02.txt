### Monday 2 February

I think I am about to finish The Waves. I think I might finish it on Saturday.

This is merely an authorâ€™s note: never have I screwed my brain so tight over a book. The proof is that I am almost incapable of other reading or writing. I can only flop wide once the morning is over. Oh Lord the relief when this week is over, & I have anyrate the feeling that I have wound up & done with that long labour: ended that vision. I think I have just done what I meant: of course I have altered the scheme considerably; but my feeling is that I have insisted upon saying, by hook or by crook certain things I meant to say. I imagine that the hookedness may be so great that it will be a failure from a readerâ€™s point of view. Well, never mind: it is a brave attempt, I think, & marks something struggled for. Oh & then the delight of skirmishing free againâ€”the delight of being idle, & not much minding what happens; & then I shall be able to read again, with all my mindâ€”a thing I havenâ€™t done these 4 months I daresay. This will have taken me 18 months to write: & we cant publish it till the autumn I suppose.

William P. talked more of his new novel, the Autobiography or Experiences? of an Emigrant the other night than L. has talked of his books all his life.
