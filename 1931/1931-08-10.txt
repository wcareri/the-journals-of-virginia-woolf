### Monday 10 August

No I will not let this day be a bad one, though it has every sign of so being. First an argument with L. at breakfast about seeing his family: the usual rather embittered argument: which deprives me of my boxâ ; & then a headache is incipient; which is caused, partly, by Charleston; where we were very gay; & I gave away prizes; & then involved myself in one of my miserable edge sitting tenebrous exquisitely uneasy dialogues with Raymond: shd. I ask him to stayâ€”should I not? Nessa did: Nessa who has Roger, & will have Jean. And now we were to ask R. to come; & now I sit in the lodge this grey pale morning & will not go on with Flush, because of my head; & we have a day in London tomorrow; & should begin to correct my first proofs; & perhaps shall when Iâ€™ve done this. No, I say, I will not let this day be a bad one: but by what means? Quiet & control. Eating applesâ€”sleeping this afternoon. Thats all. And now for Waves.

I have now 10.45, read the first chapter of The Waves, & made no changes, save 2 words & 3 commas. Yes, anyhow this is exact & to the point. I like it. And see that for once my proofs will be dispatched with a few pencil strokes. Now my brood mounts: I think â€œI am taking my fences.. We have asked Raymond. I am forging through the sea, in spite of headache in spite of bitternessâ€”I may also get a boxâ .â€ I will now write a little at Flush.
