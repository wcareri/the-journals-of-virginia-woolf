### Wednesday 30 September

I have come up here on this the last evening to clear up papers. All is softly grey: L.â€™s yellow dahlias are burning on the edge of the terrace. I have been over to Asheham, in the clear pale autumn afternoon, along Mandrill walk, which we walked the night of our marriage. How proud I was of my new despatch box, I remember! So its over, this summer too; & I regret it, & want to stay on, & soothe my mind with (here a wretched little post comes in) with Elizabethan poets. Instead we go up tomorrow, & doesnâ€™t the lift of my heart tell me that strain, about The Waves, friends, reviewers, sales, &c. will then begin to make a fiddle string in my side, stretched tight, on which lots of people will carelessly twang this winter. No help for itâ€”So it always is with a book out.

And it will be out in one week tomorrow. But I am slightly less naked than usual, as Iâ€™ve had 3 outside opinions & shanâ€™t I suppose get any very great variety of praise or blame. I must make up my mind about the autumn lap, & my bearing. And do some quiet work: & â€˜seeâ€™ people not so wearily.

But here I am saying the summer is overâ€”the wet, driven, rather headachy summerâ€”so August was. September improved. How happy I was writing about Donne, up here, how happy a dozen times on solitary walks, in what a rage the day I found Hancockâ€™s horror building on the hill, & then we had many & many a game of bowls, & there was the great financial crisis, & then going to Dotty & the Easedales, & the tremendous talk carnivalâ€”which I went through with shut lipsâ€”I mean looking for no pleasureâ€”last week end. And now apple baskets are filling in the drawing room, & I must seriously set to & destroy & mass together two months of papers.
