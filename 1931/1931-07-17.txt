### Friday 17 July

Yes. This morning I think I may say I have finished. That is to say I have once more, for the 18th time, copied out the opening then lost sentences. L. will read it tomorrow; & I shall open this book to record his verdict. My own opinion,â€”oh dearâ€”, its a difficult book. I donâ€™t know that Iâ€™ve ever felt so strained. And Iâ€™m nervous, I confess, about L. For one thing he will be honest, more than usually. And it may be a failure. And I canâ€™t do any more. And Iâ€™m inclined to think it good but incoherent, inspissate: one jerk succeeding another. Anyhow it is laboured, compact. Anyhow I had a shot at my vision & if its not a catch, its a cast in the right direction. But Iâ€™m nervous. It may be small & finicky in general effect. Lord knows. As I say, repeating it to enforce the rather unpleasant little lift in my heart, I shall be nervous to hear what L. says when he comes out, say tomorrow night or Sunday morning to my garden room, carrying the MS & sits himself down & begins â€œWell!â€
