### Saturday 15 August

I am in rather a flutterâ€”proof reading. I can only read a few pages at a time. So it was when I wrote it, & Heaven knows what virtue it all has, this pressed ecstatic book. All I note here though is that I feel vibrational; get violent impressions from Roger Raymond, Sibyl, Vita. Sibyl came by her own request yesterday; & I wondered after 2 hours jerking barren gossip, what satisfaction she got from it. Once she looked at the downs. The worst of being Sibyl is that one suspects every action of some motive. â€œI am proving myself a woman who loves the countryâ€. One never feels, This is what she likes, as I do when Vita stumbles over the marsh & hardly has a word to say. S. looks at chairs & tables; sums one up: has a magpies eye, a larder of facts which she will hand on at her next meeting. Nobody scarcely will let themselves be themselves: & I am a sinner sometimes. Then, as we stood at the door, she tried to make us invite her to stay. And I resisted; why should she want us to ask her to stay? I asked. She had been at the Gagesâ€™, again, I suppose, self invited. As you see, S.â€™s company does not lead to lofty reflections; does not put one on oneâ€™s mettle, except to show off. Old Vita shaggy & stiff, writing another novel; but as careless about it all as ever. Eddy had written to abuse A.P.S. She was annoyed; then tore up his letter. Harold is starting a new paper Action on Oct. 1st: costing 2d. Cold, wet, lights at luncheon; the cat kittened in the coalhole; the valuable spaniel bitch died in childbed next door. A wet wild August, the coldest for 14 years; & the farmers here burning their hay. Meanwhile the country is in the throes of a crisis. Great events are brewing. Maynard visits Downing Street & spreads sensational rumours. Are we living then through a crisis; & am I fiddling? & will future ages, as they say, behold our predicament (financial) with horror? Sometimes I feel the world desperate; then walk among the downs. Last night, after Sibyl, after thunder & rain, specially various, tender, fleeting, evanescent, I stood by the gate & watched Asheham hill cloud & kindle like the emerald it is. And all round the hills lay, low in cloud.
