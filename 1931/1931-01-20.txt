### Tuesday 20 January

I have this moment, while having my bath, conceived an entire new bookâ€”a sequel to a Room of Ones Ownâ€”about the sexual life of women: to be called Professions for Women perhapsâ€”Lord how exciting! This sprang out of my paper to be read on Wednesday to Pippaâ€™s society. Now for The Waves. Thank Godâ€”but Iâ€™m very much excited.
