### Monday 20 April

Gradual southerly feelingâ€”men playing boules. Old men getting out of cars to pick flowers in the woods. Roads as straight as rods; some of them entirely lined with trees; their tops touching. But the worst weather so far. Car shut all day. Reached Niort at 6: determined to push on 40 miles to La Rochelle. Arrived at 7.30â€”so quick one drives: I forgot our 2 punctures. One at Thouart; kept us, as the man did not mend it while we lunched. I read Sons & Lovers, every word: a merry go round. Wished for fur coat. Another puncture 10 miles later. Had to stand in rain & change wheel. Scraped a hole in the road. On & off again. Went into hotel on the place. Found them dancing: so came here (de France et Angleterre) Exactly rightâ€”very cirÃ© floors: quiet: a garden: ruins; lilac; flower pot roofs; but still gray this morning. Window open though; & not actually raining.
