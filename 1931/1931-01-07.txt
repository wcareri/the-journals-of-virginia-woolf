### Wednesday 7 January

Well, we have just got back, had our tea, Francis Birrell has called been dismissed, & there are two hours to dinner. What am I to do with two hours? I dont want to spend them fuming over my new established & respectable householdâ€”Nelly in the kitchen & Lottie attempting concealment in the bed room. And I cant settle to read The Enormous Room, nor Madame du Deffand either. L. is busy coping with Miss Belsher & correspondence.

My head is not in the first spring of energy: this fortnight has brought me no views of the lapping downsâ€”no fields & hedges too many firelit houses & lit up pages, & pen & inkâ€”curse my influenza. It is very quiet hereâ€”not a sound but the hiss of the gaz. Oh but the cold was too great at Rodmell. I was frozen like a small sparrow. And I did write a few staggering sentences. Few books have interested me more to write than The Waves. Why even now, at the end, Iâ€™m turning up a stone or two: no glibness, no assurance; you see, I could perhaps do Bâ ernardâ€™s soliloquy in such a way as to break up, dig deep, make prose moveâ€”yes I swearâ€”as prose has never moved before: from the chuckle & the babble to the rhapsody. Something new goes into, my pot every morning something thats never been got at before. The high wind canâ€™t blow, because Iâ€™m chopping & tacking all the time. And Iâ€™ve stored a few ideas for articles: one on Gosseâ€”the critic as talker; the armchair critic; one on Lettersâ€”one on Queensâ€”

Now this is true: The Waves is written at such high pressure that I cant take it up & read it through between tea & dinner; I can only write it for about one hour, from 10 to 11.30. And the typing is almost the hardest part of the work. Heaven help me if all my little 80,000 word books are going in future to cost me two years! But I shall fling off, like a cutter leaning on its side, on some swifter, slighter adventureâ€”another Orlando perhaps.

I looked out at dawn once or twiceâ€”a redness, like wood fire cinders, in a frosty sky; frost thick on the fields; the candles alight in some of the cottages, & so back to bed, wrapping my clothes round me. And every morning I took the bellows & chafed up my logs, & made a game of it, & almost always won my blazing fire by the time L. came up.

How I dislike servants voices & giggles. Enoughâ€”enough.

We shall play the Grosse Fugue tonightâ€”Ethel, I daresay, will ring up. I shall go down & get the post. Tom, Lyn & Ethel have written: I am asked to contribute to a symposium on Loveâ€”& thats about all. But already we are committed to â€˜seeâ€™ 6 people before Mondayâ€”the only one of importance is John Lehmann. And shall I now write to Arthur Symons about his novel? O dear. What machine is there for making 1 hour & 35 minutes blaze?
