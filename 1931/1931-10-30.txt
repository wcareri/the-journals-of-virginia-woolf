### Friday 30 October

Happily that morbidity of L.â€™s is over. Other things have intervened, & praise & some sale And the General Election which has returned I think 26 Labour members to Parliament. But as I went to Jamesâ€™s to hear the results, was in the midst of a chattering crowd (Nina Hamnet drunk) my head aches. I rubbed the ache in dining at the Woolf family party last night. Cant write, cant read. Ohâ€”yesterday we made an offer for 47 Gordon Sqreâ€”a house where we may die; for its a 24 years lease. Strange to anchor there again. In order that these notes may remain solid I make them; but cannot comment.
