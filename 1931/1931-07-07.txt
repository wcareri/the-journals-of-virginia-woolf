### Tuesday 7 July

O to seek relief from this incessant correction (I am doing the interludes) & write a few words carelessly. Still better, to write nothing; to tramp over the downs, blown like thistle, as irresponsible. And to get away from this hard knot in which my brain has been so tight spunâ€”I mean The Waves.

Such are my sentiments at half past twelve on Tuesday July 7thâ€”a fine day I think & everything, so the tag runs in my head, handsome about us. L. is now floating on the tide of celebrity: odd how the strings all begin to tug at once: asked to Broadcast, asked to go to America, asked to write the Weekly Wayfarer in the Statesman. And I am not jealous.

But I am fearful of what I call (though this much puzzles Fraulein Guide) Life. (Fr. G. is studying my works in the Brit. Mus. & cannot be sure what life is, so writes to ask me.) Clive is back, & as I observe instantly on opening the door, favourably disposed towards me. For example he says What lovely flowers! Ethel has been penitent after her fashion for her letter. That is she came yesterday, after an intermission of almost a fortnight, & defended & explained herself in a speech which lasted 20 minutes by my watch. She raised her cup of tea 6 times to her lips but always thought of some new parenthesis or qualification & put it down untouched. Her zeal, sincerity & vitality of course convince; though Iâ€™m glad to drive my stake in firmly & so avoid complete overwhelming. I shout obloquies at her like gun shots. She takes them on her solid old body with a thud like that on an elephantâ€™s hide. Staggers, recovers herself, & stands pendant & prominentâ€”for she has a paunchâ€”over me. I dominate by silenceâ€”a phenomenon to her very formidable. And off she goes at 6.45 subduedâ€”like Pinka L. says, when she has been grouting in the rubbish heap. We kissâ€”she passionately in the hall, while Miss Pritchard shelters behind her door, slightly alarmed I think. But what care I might be Ethelâ€™s song: & for that I like her.

I am reading Don Juan; & dispatch a biography every two days.

So no more.

Long discussion the other night between Ott., Tommie, Mary & ourselves upon being in the cage: Mary rampant; like a horse when a train passes a field. Must escape. Must find a brazen man & go to Spain. Why dont we do anything? Change our lives? She live with L. I with Jack? Why this hedge of telephone calls daily? Why not expose a different self?
