### Wednesday 25 March

And here I sit, waiting to go to the Richmonds, having lunched with Clive, about to dine with the Wolves. Wine at lunch flushes me & floats me. So with Tom. A bad thing. My hair came down. Yesterday at the docks with Harold. Tomorrow, Ethelâ€™s party at Nessaâ€™s. Friday Tantivy Towersâ€”wh. reminds me to write more letters before I change. Lord Lord.
