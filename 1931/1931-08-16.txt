I should really apologise to this book for using it as I am doing to write off my aimlessness; that is I am doing my proofsâ€”the last chapter this morningâ€”& find that I must stop after half an hour, & let my mind spread, after these moments of concentration. I cannot write my life of Flush, because the rhythm is wrong. I think The Waves is anyhow tense & packed; since it screws my brain up like this. And what will the reviewers say? And my friends? They cant, of course, find anything very new to say.

L. is in the house making his Index & printing the photographs we developed last night.

The reason why Colefax is so dull is that she never feels or thinks for herself. That is why I should suffocate of dust if she spent a night here. Also she is forever collecting facts about one, not from interest, but from curiosity. It is a warning not to go to places like Argyll House again, because one is expected to make some return.*

It is a good idea I think to write biographies; to make them use my powers of representation reality accuracy; & to use my novels simply to express the general, the poetic. Flush is serving this purpose.

We had a perfectly happy day yesterday. I set up some of Dadieâ€™s poems in the new room; walked on the marshes. L. cut the apple trees; it was a lovely dayâ€”indeed this broken weather has the merit of an extraordinary capricious beauty. I doubt that I have ever seen the downs lovelier. I am in a fix though about Ethel, who with considerable brutality to back her, asks if she may come here. When peopleâ€”G.L.Dâ  or instanceâ€”put us off, we are almost shocked; & then feel an amazed relief. Is it possible that there is someone who does not want to see us? Such royalty we have becomeâ€”in our set, as Ethel says. She annoys me by telling Lady Craik that I live in a set, & am a recluse. Now, alas, I must back to Bernard (on Pâ â€™s death)

One of Sibylâ€™s sayings, or insinuations: â€œAh, if only Arthur & I could afford a country cottageâ€â€”with her Rolls Royce & her chauffeur at the door.

** The poor woman today Wednesday writes a pathetic letter about other summers & regrets, & how all the same they drank (A. & she) their delights to the full; & the sight of us thoâ€™ it stirred these sorrows comforted her
