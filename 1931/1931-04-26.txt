### Sunday 26 April

On to Poitiers. Went to Movies last night after a good dinner at the hotel we shd. have stayed at. Laughed violently at animals in hotel. A light risible methodâ€”the Frenchâ€”of telling the story of a cycle raceâ€”done by quick drawings on a sheet. Out into cold townâ€”all spread for sun, which does not come. Cold windy drive this morning. Country might be Hampshire, save for emptiness. No cars. Poitiers for lunch. A Restaurant. Officers lunching & their young ladiesâ€”rather provincial. Enormous meal made by a thick slab of a manâ€”painful to see soufflÃ© disappear. Visited churches, heard women baa-ing responses like sheep. Rain & cold by fits; so came back to read & write till dinner. A quiet homely hotel; room looking onto courtyard, but still cold. 

No central heating that night; so had to go to bed for warmth, as before.
