Newhaven: dinner, hotel lately done up in modern style. Guests surprising. 2 young men in trousers are women. One is Mrs Pilkington. Conversation on phone. â€œOh darling Judy .. longing to see youâ€”Ethel too marvellous. In bed at 2.30 this morning. Now at Newhavenâ€. Yet her stride & gestures male: check shirt. The other had feminine face: was the woman of the two: but trousers. Nobody stared. Ordered cocktails. Other guests, man like Tartarin: bushy black beard sprouting from chin: bare ankles: yatchting cap: but English. Others a newly married pair; bride in full evening dress. Rung up. Maybe the familyâ€”herâ€™s presumably. Elderly married couples, crossing, like ourselves, looked too respectable in this comedy film star atmosphereâ€”at Newhaven of all places. And a fairly good dinner.
