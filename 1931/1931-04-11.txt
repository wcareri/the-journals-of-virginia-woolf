### Saturday 11 April

Oh I am so tired of correcting my own writingâ€”these 8 articlesâ€”I have however learnt I think to dash: & not to finick. I mean the writing is free enough: its the repulsiveness of correcting that nauseates me. And the cramming in & the cutting out. And articles & more articles are asked for. For ever I could write articles.

But I have no penâ€”well, it will just make a mark. And not much to say. or rather too much & not the mood.

We came back on Thursday. The sun at once roseâ [;] all the leaves pushed; the grass in the Square was literally liquid emerald. And so on. Imagine my regrets for Monks House: & how I start in the nightâ€”my early mornings are terrible battlesâ€”Fight fightâ€”yet later I cant remember what the fights aboutâ€”saying Curse, oh God, curse: as I remember that hideous new house on the top of my down; the rampart so often looked at on my evening walk. They are building the garage now; so we dig ourselves in.

And I saw Pernel & of course, on top of Pernel Peter; so she was cross & he was pertinacious, & I had to skim the two of them with talk about Mrs Huntâ€™s life of E. Siddal: not what I wanted to say. But these lovers have the pertinacity of gnats round flames: must talk, even if not about Sheilah.

On Thursday we have our fortnight in France. I intend to keep a diary so as to make each day last longer. I think I shall like La Rochelle best: I shall want to live there. I shall take a house there: I shall dream of walking there when I am old & full of sleep.

Here I will paste inâ€”though it is hardly worth the trouble, the fitful flying notes I made, generally very cold, rather wet, with a rug round my knees, for the weatherâ€”everybody is talking about the weather. The worst April for 50 years.

That we retrieved so much from it that was lovely, ravishing, amusing & had so many good hours, spinning along the wet roads, under a complete grey cloud, speaks well for the state of our souls. After being married since August 1912 nineteen years, how moving to find this warmth, curiousity, attachment in being alone with L. If I dared I would investigate my own sensations with regard to him, but out of laziness, humility, pride, I dont know what reticenceâ€”refrain. I who am not reticent.
