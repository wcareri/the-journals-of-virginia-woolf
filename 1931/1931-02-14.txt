### Friday 14 February

And I had my hair curled two days ago. With some difficulty I controlled my bottomless despair when Nessa disapproved. I will front the world curled, I said to myself at 6 oâ€™clock a m: very valiantly; I like my experimental temper.

Janet Case yesterday, shrivelled, narrowed, dimmed, aged, & very poverty struck. I noted her cheap shoes & dirty old velvet hat. I suppose over 70 now; & yet I always think of her as 45. She clings to youth. â€œBut we never see any young peopleâ€ & so reads Tom Eliot &c: has her wits about her: but oh dear, the pathos when our teachers become our learners. She has had I suppose a far harder life than I knewâ€”illness, poverty, & all the narrowness of living; alone with Emphie; without any luxury, & the thoughtâ€”I dont know about thisâ€”of leaving E. or being left. She was staying with an old man of 91. A curious clutching anxious sense such old age gives one: her face has become pointed, whitened; shrunk; her eyes remain. How I used to wait for her lesson: & then the arguments, the excitements. I was 17 she said when she came. She felt unsuccessful.
