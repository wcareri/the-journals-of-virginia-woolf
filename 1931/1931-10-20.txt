### Tuesday 20 October

I trotted out yesterday & laid in a stock of Elizabethans. I should like to write a chapter called Some Ethans as prelude to the 2nd Common Reader.

I had a visit from Peter Lucas tâ€™other night. No, he had not read The W. But he has written an Epic. He is working as usual like a minerâ€”bright red all overâ€”egotisticâ€”nice, charming, boyish, hard, imperceptive, not a writer I mean, though set on writing, & indeed has a play being acted. Both our books move slowly; but L.â€™s I suspect with a giants foot, like an elephant through the undergrowth. Laski says, as reviewers say these things, it is a masterpiece. We makers of masterpieces remain very calm, very well content. We went to the Motor Show, for instance, last Saturday (autumn deepening) & approved The Star, which indeed we could buy if we wished. Itâ€™s a queer reversal. Hereâ€™s Lottie out of a place & Mrs Hunt wont accept fees as places arenâ€™t to be had. How things have spun these 2 or 3 years then!

Oh its blue again over my skylightâ€”please God it stays blue over our week end, the blessed Rodmell week end. Vaguely looking for houses again, & turning over plans for removing. All houses pale though before this one. Iâ€™m asked to be Godmother to Noel Richardsâ€™ daughter. Yet she wont dine here. Election rampant. Plomer & DoBree dined the other night. He a nimble secondrate man: his grandfather the pawnbroker in Vanity Fair.
