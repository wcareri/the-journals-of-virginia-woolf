Dreams.

I had three lately: one of Katherine Mansfield: how we met, beyond death, & shook hands; saying something by way of explanation, & friendship: yet I knew she was dead. A curious summing up, it seemed, of what has passed since she died.

Then the dream of Daphne Sanger, & how she was proved to be the heir to the throne of England. And Charlie was there. And another dream which L. coming in to say that Jean Stewart wants to come to tea, has caused me to forget. I diagnose, by the way, a coldness on the part of Ethel. No communications since last Tuesday save one rather formal card. I shall lie low & do nothing.

Oh dear me noâ€”no quarrel at all.

Two notes: the woman in white stamping on bread in Kensington Gardens: the Indian looking woman ferreting in the litter boxâ€”both wild, outlandish, in shabby finery, within a hands pace. This was last week.
