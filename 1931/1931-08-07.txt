Monks House Rodmell

I have just written those august words, Rodmell. August 1931. And its as good, no better than I thought. Who else in the whole of Sussex can say that? Weather all sorts; river running; boat swimming; loud speaker, camera, Electric Light, frigidaireâ€”thus I run through those material blessings which one ought to say make no difference. Yet they doâ€”Heal beds too: my wide empty room to wake in; to go to bed in crossing the garden by the pale flowersâ€”the garden lit by our bright lights. We were at Oare, & I like this country better for comparing it. And I made no note of Sydney, save that he has been given the tip by Godâ€”a queer feeling; spreads round him an oily surface of superficial calm. Then I sat to Tommie. Oh dear, what a terrific hemp strong heather root obstinate fountain of furious individuality shoots in meâ€”they tampered with it, Nessa & Tommyâ€”pinning me there, from 2 to 4 on 6 afternoons, to be looked at; & I felt like a piece of whalebone bent. This amused & interested me, at the same time I foamed with rage. T. was late. T. couldnâ€™t change his plans & so on. And I had to plod along the dusty streets there.

And Rosamond Lehmann dined with Lord David; & I liked her; & at last, at last, at last, on Thursday 30th we got into the car, slammed the door, & made off. And how satisfactory it has been, is being. I writing Flush of a morning, half seriously to ease my brain, knotted by all that last screw of The Waves: L. doing his broadcast & correcting proofs, no one coming, except Bells: no one ringing up; no one to say dinnerâ€™s ready, or to be stumping about in the kitchen. Annie, composed, neat, nimble, has everything disposed of by 3â€”which reminds me I must go & put the pie in the oven, I think. And lights & shadows & walksâ€”today over to Northease & back by the marsh; almost forgiving the pink slate abortion on the Telscombe horizon. Goat Farm isnâ€™t so much of an eyesore as might have been. True, one day I was frittered into fury by Worthing & Mrs W. & her sudden curious revival of arch airs that had charmed diamond merchants in the 70s. How odd that sudden spurt of sex in a woman of 80! How repulsive to me that flutter of rather cheap attractivenessâ€”that value for Mr Leggeâ€™s good opinionâ€”he had taken her to the Pavilion & hired a special car. â€œNice eh?â€ she laughed, as if she were on some beach with other Jewesses 50 years ago. So it seemed. And then one saw her old & pink & wattled & overdressed, demanding amusement, pleasure, cakes, drivesâ€”but enough (as they say): I wrote these very words last summer, & this summer all will be over, with one smashing family tea, by the 25th.

Lovely are the curves of the grey clouds sweeping; & the long barns lying; Vita writes this morning about K Mâ€™s letters & says how she longs for all poets in a garden; no more; whereas Harold is becoming, they say, editor of a new morning paper & has resigned from the Standard. And are you fond of me? she asks.
