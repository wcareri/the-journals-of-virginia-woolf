### Sunday 3 May

52 Tavistock Square.

Yes, thats all very well; but how to begin, & why begin? I mean what do these diaries amount to? O merely matter for a book, I think: & to read when I have a headache. After all, Percy could burn the lot in one bonfire. He could burn them at the edge of the field where, so we think, we shall lie buried. That was our conclusion after attending Arnold Bennettâ€™s funeral.

But now, say I have a 3 months lap ahead of me: the 3 summer months. What shall I do? We are going to regulate â€˜seeingâ€™ people. There is to be a weekly black hole; a seething mass of people all eating tea together. We shall thus have more evenings free. In those evenings I intend to walk; to read, Elizabethans; to be mistress of my soul. Yes. And I intend to investigate Edinburgh & Stratford on Avon. Also to finish off The Waves in a dashing masterly manner. D H Lawrence has given me much to think aboutâ€”about writing for writings sake. Two days are to be set aside for reading MSS: & they are not to leak into other compartments. These two decisionsâ€”the Black Hole, & Hogarth Press MSS, will I think make for an orderly & satisfactory summer. Then of course, being now so well off, with 2 frigidaires & everything handsome, I need not fritter & fribble about clothes; & having little sense of the duty of society left, shall hope to take my way about unhasting unresting. I want to see the fields & flowers, one or two new places; to write some good articles. At the moment, I seem able to write criticism fearlessly. Because of a R. of ones Own I said suddenly to myself last night.
