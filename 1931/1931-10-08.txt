### Thursday 8 October

Well, to continue this egotistic diary: I am not terribly excited: no: at armâ€™s length more than usual all this talk, because if The W. is anything it is an adventure which I go on alone: & the dear old Lit Sup. who twinkles & beams & patronisesâ€”a long, & for The Times, kind & outspoken reviewâ€”dont stir me very much. Nor Harold in Action either. Yes; to some extent; I shd. have been unhappy had they blamed, but Lord, how far away I become from all this; & weâ€™re jaded too, with people, with doing up parcels.

I wonder if it is good to feel this remotenessâ€”that is, that The W. is not what they say. Odd, that they (The Times) shd. praise my characters when I meant to have none. But Iâ€™m jaded; I want my marsh, my down, & quiet waking in my airy bedroom. Broadcasting tonight; to Rodmell tomorrow. Next week I shall have to stand the racket.
