### Tuesday 23 June

And yesterday, 22nd Juneâ€”when, I think, the days begin to draw in, I finished my re-typing of The Waves. Not that it is finishedâ€”oh dear no. For then I must correct the re-re-typing. This work I began on May 5th, & no one can say that I have been hasty or careless this time; though I doubt not the lapses & slovenlinesses are innumerable.

A dark kind of summer. The cloud that hung over La Rochelle in April still hangs over London. In spite of this, owing to good resolutions, my little life has been adventurous & more stable than usual. There was Duncanâ€™s show; & considerable content, indeed a kind of bubbling rapture I think, in Fitzroy Street.! must ask Nessa why we are so happy. Clive is in Cassis. Julian has grown a bristling beard like a chimpanzee & is off with volumes of Pope in MS to France. Tonight we go to the Gala Opera with Christabel. Stalls costing 25/-each.

I mean to record some literal conversations one of these days. Goldie wrote a qualified letter of praise about L.â€™s book: new & important ideas: the style repetitive & tedious. I distrust this, since Goldieâ€™s own mechanical style, the mould made in Greece, since considerably smoothed out, never takes my fancy: in fact I should not exaggerate if I said that I detest it: & its currency, plausibility & general first class aspect.

On Wednesdayâ€”tomorrowâ€”Ethel comes, & we have a party. Such is lifeâ€”so gliding on. It is 12.30.
