### Saturday 28 March

Arnold Bennett died last night; which leaves me sadder than I should have supposed. A lovable genuine man; impeded, somehow a little awkward in life; well meaning; ponderous; kindly; coarse; knowing he was coarse; dimly floundering & feeling for something else. Glutted with success: wounded in his feelings: avid; thick lipped: prosaic intolerably; rather dignified; set upon writing; yet always taken in; deluded by splendour & success; but naÃ¯ve; an old bore; an egotist; much at the mercy of life for all his competence; a shop keepers view of literature; yet with the rudiments, covered over with fat & prosperity & the desire for hideous Empire furniture, of sensibility. Some real understanding power, as well as a gigantic absorbing power.â€”These are the sort of things that I think by fits & starts this morning, as I sit journalising; I remember his determinatâ ion to write, 1000 words daily; & how he trotted off to do it that night: & feel some sorrow that now he will never sit down & begin methodically covering his regulation number of pages in his workmanlike beautiful but dull hand. Queer how one regrets the dispersal of any body who seemedâ€”as I sayâ€”genuine; who had direct contact with lifeâ€”for he abused me; & I yet rather wished him to go on abusing me; & me abusing him. An element in lifeâ€”even in mine that was so remoteâ€”taken away. This is what one minds.
