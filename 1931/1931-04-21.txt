### Tuesday 21 April

To Marennes. Cold & dark at first; gradually cleared. Our finest day. People at once begin lounging: put shutters up. Went to Marennes, across an emerald green marsh: deserted, a cow or two: a tall spare woman dressed in black like a clergyman. At Bourgeantâ€”a town in an old wall; tufted with grass. Lovely country, a ferry, aeroplanes looping loop. Church in Marennes; old ship slung from ceiling. The hotel of the oysters 2 Ki. on. Sat at green table in the sun & drank coffee: L. had 12 oysters: alive: twisted in his mouth he said; green: with distorted shells. A pine wood; all silent; no bungalows. low sea. boats out at oyster banks. Very lovely drive back across the marsh. Tall marsh grasses fine yellow like babiesâ€™ hair: broad brown river. Friendly men on ferry. Home. Now colder. Car jammed. First wholly fine day. Lunch off patÃ© & croissants in the marsh. Hotel food soon bores.
