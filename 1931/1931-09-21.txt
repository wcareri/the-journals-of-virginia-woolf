Here am I writing about Donne, & we have â€˜gone off the Gold Standardâ€™ this morning. Maynard & Kahan like people in the war. We sat talking economics & politics. Guards out: Tower defended (this a joke on M.â€™s part). Telephones: late edition of the paper. Weâ€™re off, & I write about Donne. Yes; & what could I do better, if we are ruined, & if everybody had spent their time writing about Donne we should not have gone off the Gold Standardâ€”thats my version of the greatest crisis &c &c &câ€”gabble gabble go the geese, who cant lay golden eggs.
