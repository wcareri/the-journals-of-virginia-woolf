No, I have just said, it being 12.45â€”I cannot write any more, & p. 162 therefore halfway. in 26 days. shall finish by 1st July with luck.indeed I cannot: I am copying the death chapter: have re-written it twice. I shall go at it again & finish it, I hope, this afternoon. But how it rolls into a tight ball the muscles in my brain! This is the most concentrated work I have ever doneâ€”& oh the relief when it is finished. But also the most interesting. ~~p. 137~~

A letter from Desmond this morning to say that he is sending his book to Putnam because, alas, it represents his life work; & though once he thought he could have done more, he now sees this is all, & therefore must seek a more durable publisher than the Hogarth Press.

To annoy me, Mary Hâ  rings up & says they are thinking of taking Southease this summer. Surrounded by fashion & bungalows, I feel like a fish in a frying pan. But no doubt shall skip out. I dont like the idea of meeting Mary & Barbara appropriately dressed on the downs. Happily, some menial of the Pritchards is now hammering, & I have an excuse to go up to luncheon.
