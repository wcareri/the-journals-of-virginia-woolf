### Thursday 3 September

I am taking, this is the last dayâ€”my weeks holiday, with very good results. My brain is soft & warm & fertile again, I feel fresh & free with energy for talk. Yes, I can even envisage â€˜seeingâ€™ people without a clutch & a shudder. Odd how I drink up restâ€”how I become dry & parched like a withered grassâ€”how then I become green & succulent. By the way, Elizabethan prose is magnificent: & all that I love most at the moment. I bathed myself in Dekker last night as in my natural element. Surely this is a nobler instrument than Scott or the 18th Century. We listened to a Bach concert with the clouds thickening purple over Caburn, the lights springing, & the pale cadaverous glow in the chalk pit. At one moment the brown horses stampededâ€”flinging out their great legs wildly. The worst of it is that my brain fills too fastâ€”overflows. Waiting for breakfast I read Montaigne this morning & found a passage about the passions of womenâ€”their voracityâ€”which I at once opposed to Squireâ€™s remarks & so made up a whole chapter of my Tap at the Door or whatever it is, just when I was hoping to let my mind slide off on to a second Common Reader, & the Elizabethans. No letter from Vita, to whom I wrote from my bed; & none from Nessa, to whom I sent Â£50. A few letters from American lunatics which I must answer, must I?â€”& stop writing. Will I write a statement What I believe for the American Nation. No. But what do I believe? Other people do this sort of thing. Why not I?

And what was I saying? Oh I was annoyed with Desmondâ€™s usual sneer at Mrs Dallowayâ€”woolgathering. I was inspired to make up several phrases about Desmondâ€™s own processesâ€”none of which, I suppose, will ever be fired off in print. His worldliness, urbanity, decorum as a writer; his soft supple ways. His audience of teaparty ladies & gentlemen. His timidity. How he wraps everything in flannel. (Browning said this of a cold morning in Paris). And thereâ€™s truth in what I say of Desmond, not only spite. Then his ridiculous hesitations & nervousness as a writer, about publishing. His perpetual condescension. His now permanent stoop in the back. His aloofnessâ€”in the bad sense. I mean he never takes a nettle by the leaves: always wears gloves. His garrulity. Well, let me hope that all his 8 volumes will fail, that he wont be able to pay his income tax & that Michael will be eaten by leopards. Then I shall meet him & my eyes will fill with tears. But its trueâ€”a snubâ€”even praiseâ€”from Desmond, depresses me more than the downright anger of Arnold Bennettâ€”it saps my vitality.

I open this book again to record the fact that this is the 3rd of September. The battle of Dunbar: the battle of Worcester, & the death of Cromwell. A heavy flagging windy cloudy day with breadths of sun: not actually raining. Its odd how I always remember father saying that at St Ives on this day, & how I am always writing something in a diary on this day & generally it is crisp & clear.
