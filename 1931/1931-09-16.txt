### Wednesday 16 September

Oh but this morning Iâ€™m like a bee in the ivy bloomâ€”cant write for pleasure. John says â€œBut I loved it, truly loved it, & was deeply impressed & amazed by its achievement in an entirely new methodâ€¦. There seems to me only the thinnest wall between such a novel & poetry. You somehow maintain the speed of prose & the intensity of poetryâ€¦â€ And its very difficult he adds; & so on. But my brain is flushed & flooded & Iâ€™m at once inspired to write a Letter to a Young Poet. Lord what a weathercockâ€”no a wave of emotion is in me.
