### Friday 17 April

Very wet: very cold: horrid seaside marine atmosphere: all drenched & shrubs blown as usual at Dieppe. Breakfast in the usual hotel. Started. Wind & rain: almost black air. Rain came through. At the ferry at Quilleboeuf L. saw blue sky. Great rejoicing. Lunch at Inn by ferryâ€”cheap, coarse; burnt fish. Old man & woman country people lunching. He had a thimble of brandy in his coffee. On again. Cold but fine in bouts. Along country roads. No houses. Came to AlenÃ§on. A white elegant old town, with a great magnolia tree all stuck thick with flowers. Heard a loudspeaker in an old house, where a girl sat under rows of jars writing. Odd little scene. Vast bare Place for soldiers. Dined badlyâ€”save for wine; a whole bottle. Guests: 4 French businessmen & one Chinese business man: a girl like Fredegond & very old man. Talk about trains to Paris. Cold water in our bath; for which we paid heavily. Bitter cold: but suffocated with hot air early in the morning. Started for Saumur. Drove more slowly. April weather, bitter cold. Not enough clothes on. Lunch at SablÃ©-sur-Sarthe: not good food yet. Little old town on river. Saw old castle at Durtal: turned into almshouses or hotel; dusty with waterproof peaked towers.
