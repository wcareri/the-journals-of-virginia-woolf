### Saturday 18 April

Saumur, cold & wet, with gleams, though. The Loireâ€”vast, without a single boat. France very empty. Hotel improved, hotter water. Women said they had been wearing cotton dressesâ€”weather unknown. Saw the big round church by the river. A market. Started; having forgotten change of time. Bad morning. Went to Fontevrault. Saw beautiful bare old convent church. Dont take off your hat, said man. Its not sacred. The tombs of Plantagenets: like Edith Sitwell: straight, narrow side by side: re-painted, blue & red. Now all this great convent where filles de France educated a prison. Prison bells ringing for their dinner. Fountain where the girls washed before dinner. The cold must have been worse then. The Abbesses had themselves painted in frescoesâ€”fat, sensual, highnosed faces.

Went on in rain across country: narrow yellow roads: old women sitting in fields under umbrellas near sheep. Biblical. Behind time. Lunch at Thouars: the food still no better than food in English Inns L. says.
