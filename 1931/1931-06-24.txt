### Wednesday 24 June

Last night we went to the gala opera; sat in the stalls, 2 rows from the stage, with Christabel & a woman, who came in late, called Lady Abingdon. Her fortune has been spent on her face. Perfectly agile, direct, slim. She has only a thin rigid trickle of a mind, & no play, range, or more than an inch of depth. But she is perfectly energised: knew what she was after. Christabel, to weld these incompatibles (L. &c) told stories of Princess Mary at Mrs Marshallâ€™s party: how she stopped, jerked; was short clumsy, dressed like the upper housemaid in peacock blue. In the interval, old bibulous Maurice Baring red as a turkey cock, a survival from the Regency as I feel, came following, to clear Gosseâ€™s character; which he didâ€”but Evan Charteris had already done itâ€”amiably enough. He has pink eye starting, & long equine teeth. Then Mrs Grenfell, whose chin, as C. said (C. is witty in her skimming way, & exactly fits this kind of thing) should have an inch or two hammered off. People passing. Old women like Roman matrons, ample, tightly girt; girls wand like: many large clear stoned necklaces & long dresses. I got the feeling of this traditional English life; its garden like quality; flowers all in beds & rows; & the ceremony that has been in being so many years. Between the acts we all stood in the street; a dry brilliant night, with women all opening their cloaks: then came dribbling through us a draggled procession of poor women wheeling perambulators & carrying small, white haired dazed children; going across Waterloo bridge. I watched Lady Aâ€™s expression to see if she had children; but could only gather a momentary schoolboyish compunction. The women, involved in this garish feathered crowd, pushed on stolidly. There was Tom Bridges; a gallant, irresistible General, with one leg, his head on one side; off the stage as it seemed, so typical of the distinguished elderly Beau. He has broken many hearts said C. but I donâ€™t like him. C. said she might be summoned away before the end of Prince Igor. And so she went, liking this little amorous mystery. Lady A. stalked off without a good night or glance in our direction. Each of her nails was red, & cut out like a small rose petal. L. who had been reading The Lady said this was considered in bad taste; & that men, according to The Lady, dont like it. So home, by cab. Oh & my hair stood the strain very well. I believe I can now with care master my hair.

The woman who has been standing in the square for some 6 hours daily came yesterday with a sword, upon which she leant as she pretended to read the paper. This finally got upon the household nerves, & Miss Talbot summoned her in. She then spoke (said Nelly) very nicely; regretted having annoyed anybody, & said she was waiting for Dr Rowe, of the Clinic, from which we infer that she is an ex-patient with a grievance.

I was also made to waste half an hour looking at silk stockings by Mr Lowe, & lost my temper, on being asked to deposit 3/- a thing I greatly enjoy, because it makes me seem so vigorous. Now to continue Rhodaâ€™s speech. Oh this book!â€”â€”
