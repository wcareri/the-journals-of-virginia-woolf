### Tuesday 17 November

Yes I forget, why do I want to write here, what do I want to say? with half an hour to lunch. A foggy morning; & Vita rings up; & I say (chiefly owing to my dream that she had gone off with someone, very markedly, at a party, in a small house whose room I was about to make into my study by knocking down a wallâ€”I still see it: I hear Nessa saying Sheâ€™s tired of you: then my teeth broke; then as I say Vita went off triumphantly with somebody, being sick of me; & so I woke, about 4.30, & decided that I would be firm if she rang me up & asked me to lunch with her & Gerald Heard. In truth she did do this: & I was firm; & she was charming & warm & trusty & friendly, & said she would come in this evening then, as she so much wanted to see me. Really my firmness was due to my dream).

Isnt it odd that Iâ€™m really, I believe, ostracised by some of my friends, because of The Waves, & lifted to the highest pinnacle by others, because of it? Dadie, for instance, & Goldie: but Morgan is the only one, either side, that matters.
