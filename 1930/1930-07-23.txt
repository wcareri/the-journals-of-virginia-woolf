### Wednesday 23 July

Edith Sitwell has grown very fat, powders herself thickly, gilds her nails with silver paint, wears a turban & looks like an ivory elephant, like the Emperor Heliogabalus. I have never seen such a change. She is mature, majestical. She is monumental. Her fingers are crusted with white coral. She is altogether composed. A great many people were thereâ€”& she presided. But though thus composed, her eyes are sidelong & humorous. The old Empress remembers her Scallywag days. We all sat at her feetâ€”cased in slender black slippers, the only remnants of her slipperiness & slenderness. Who was she like? Pope in a nightcap? No; the imperial majesty must be included. We hardly talked together, & I felt myself gone there rather mistakenly, had she not asked me very affectionately if she might come & see me alone. Her room was crowded with odds & ends of foreigners: the uncrowned King of Barcelona; Geraldâ€™s partner; Osbert; Lady Lavery &c. Lady L. discussed the air crash. She said le Bon Dieu had taken them all at the right time. They had all done with life. Once too she would have been glad to die â€¦ This refers to the deaths of Lord Dufferin Lady Ednam &c. I was driving down to the Temple with Vita, & we bought a Standard in the gateway. â€˜Titled victimsâ€™ she said. Well it cant be Harold I said. Then I read out Lady Ednam, Marquis Dusserre (for so they reported him) & then in the stop press Lord Dufferinâ€”What Lady Ednam? Dufferin? she cried. There was Harold on the pavement before their house. â€œYes, he said, Its Lady Ednamâ€ â€œBut its Freddy tooâ€ cried Vita (no she spoke composedly). God said Harold & read the stop press. Now what are we to do? I cant broadcast said Vita. I must tell my mother said Harold. First Iâ€™ll get the paper though. Good Lordâ€”Yes its Dufferin & Lady Ednam. â€œIs that Lady Carnock. Darling I have some bad news for you. Have you seen the paper? Freddyâ€™s been in a smash. Heâ€™s killed, they think. Could you tell Aunt Lai?â€ What did your mother say Harold? Just â€˜Ohâ€™. Now we cant dine with Lady Cunard. Oh yes dear we must. Perhaps I shall have to go down & see themâ€”It was, as one says, like a scene in a play. The newspaper: the telephoning. The extreme simplicity & composure of it all: Boski typing; the man cleaning shoes; Harold telephoning, like a man in a play. So they drove off that wet grey evening to Lady Cunardâ€™s: dinner at 9. 30 people; & I did not go. (& I hear the whole party waited for me for half an hour)
