### Saturday 11 October

The fifty coffins have just trundled by, in lorries, spread rather skimpily with Union Jacksâ€”an unbecoming pallâ€”& stuck about with red & yellow wreaths. The only impressive sight was the rhythmical bending backward slow march of the Guards: for the rest, the human face is often pock marked & ignoble; poor gunners look bored & twitch their noses; the crowd smells; the sun makes it all too like birthday cakes & crackers; & the coffins conceal too much. One bone, one charred hand, wd. have done what no ceremony can do: & the heap of a ceremony on ones little coal of feeling presses uneasily. I refer to the burial this morning of the 48 â€˜heroesâ€™ of the R101. But why â€˜heroesâ€™? A shifty & unpleasant man, Lord Thomson by all accounts, goes for a joy ride with other notables, & has the misfortune to be burnt at Beauvais. That being so, we have every reason to say Good God how very painfulâ€”how very unluckyâ€”but why all the shops in Oxford St & Southampton Row shd. display black dresses only & run up black bars; why the Nation should be requested to think of nothing else; why the people should line the streets & parade through Westminster Hall, why every paper should be filled with nobility & lamentation & praise, why the Germans should muffle their wireless & the French ordain a day of mourning & the footballers stop for two minutesâ€™ silenceâ€”beats me & Leonard & Miss Strachan.
