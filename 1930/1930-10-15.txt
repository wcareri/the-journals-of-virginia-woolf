### Wednesday 15 October

I say to myself â€œBut I cannot write another wordâ€. I say â€œI will cut adriftâ€”I will go to Roger in Franceâ€”I will sit on pavements & drink coffeeâ€”I will see the Southern hills; I will dream; I will take my mind out of its iron cage & let it swimâ€”this fine Octoberâ€. I say all this; with energy: but shall I do it? Shant I peter out here, till the fountain fills again? Oh dear oh dearâ€”for the lassitude of the spirit! Rarely rarely comest thou now, spirit of delight. You hide yourself up there behind the hotel windows & the grey clouds. (I am writing this with a steel pen which I dip in the ink, so as to forestall the day when my German pens are extinct). It is dismal to broach October so languidly. I rather think the same thing happened last year. I need solitude. I need space. I need air. I need the empty fields round me; & my legs pounding along roads; & sleep; & animal existence. My brain is too energetic; it works; it throws off an article on Christina Rossetti; & girds itself up to deal with this & that.

Rivett is installed. And she cooks like a freehanded lady. Light sketchy dishes arrive. This is only our second day, & Annie, infinitely happy garrulous & anxious to stayâ€”how can I put up with Rodmell now, she says. I shall feel shut up inside somethingâ€”Annie goes today. A curious little interlude this. Alas, one day last week Nelly appearedâ€”of course on her best behaviourâ€”very much the old & trusted servant, with, I think, a dash of suspicion. Why did I not have her back & give her help, seeing that she had been with us 15 years?â€”that I think was in her mind. But we kept it down; & she is off to Colchester for 10 days & thenâ€”oh dear, I say again, oh dear. Nessa & Duncan are at Cassis, which brings the delicious vision of France too near meâ€”Oh to walk among vineyards I cry again. And lots of people are on the buzz: dined last night with Raymond, a shabby & diminished Raymond, whom I like better than the dashing. Not much wine & so on. He has given up parties & takes Wyndham Lewis much to heart â€œA middle aged man-millinerâ€ said Lewis in that pamphlet which is like the gossip & spite & bickering of a suburban housemaid who has been given notice & is getting a bit of her own back.
