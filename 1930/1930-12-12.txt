### Friday 12 December

This, I think, is the last days breathing space I allow myself before I tackle the last lap of The Waves. I have had a week offâ€”that is to say I have written three little sketches; & dawdled, & spent a morning shopping, & a morning, this morning arranging my new table & doing odds & endsâ€”but I think I have got my breath again & must be off for 3 or perhaps 4 weeks more. Then, as I think, I shall make one consecutive writing of the waves &câ€”the interludesâ€”so as to work it into oneâ€”& thenâ€”oh dear, some must be written again; & then, corrections; & then send to Mabel; & then correct the type; & then give to Leonard. Leonard perhaps shall get it some time late in March. Then put away; then print, perhaps in June.

Meanwhile we dine with Mary on Sunday to meet Mr Hart Davis who may come to the pressâ€”but in what capacity? And two days ago we saw over 25 Tâ avistock Sâ quare to which we may move, if we decide to leave this, & can let it. But there too are obstacles; an hotel building alongside, & fewer rooms, & more expense.
