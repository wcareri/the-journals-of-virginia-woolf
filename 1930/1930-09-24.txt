### Wednesday 24 September

I have taken up my staff again; I wish I could say that my book was my staff; but oh dear, how many people I have seenâ€”dashing that support from my hand! It must have been the afternoon I wrote thisâ€”yes, because L. & Percy were in the middle of moving the furniture into the sitting roomâ€”that Mary & Barbaraâ€™s little medicine bottle heads appeared at the window. How I scowled! And then there was Alice Ritchie, then the Wolves, then Morgan, then a party at Charleston then London, & then those curious women, Miss Ibbotson & Mrs Starr.

â€œI am a cousin of Florence Nightingaleâ€ said Mrs Starr. When I said I was also related, her rather shifty eyes became shiftier. â€œI cant make omelettesâ€ said Miss Ibbotson, addressing herself plaintively & at the same time peevishly to Mrs Starr. â€œIt would be a great disaster of course if you sent in your dishes all burntâ€ said Mrs Starr. â€œYou would give me notice, I supposeâ€ said Miss Ibbotson. Miss Ibbotson was bankrupt; â€œBeggars canâ€™t be choosersâ€ she said, â€œ& so thats why Iâ€™m back again at thisâ€™. Miss Ibbotson had once owned two motor cars & driven them for hire in London, but competition with the men had been too much. She had also been ill. She was skinny, raddled; wore a small corduroy jacket, & a rather dirty white shirt; had a red pocket-handkerchief; thick mended stockings & thick shoes. Mrs Starr was dressed in blue Liberty silk & a straw hat. She reproved Miss I. for being too diffident. â€œIf I could have a trialâ€ Miss I. repeated. But you will soon pick it upâ€ said Mrs S. â€œI cant do fancy cookingâ€ said Miss I. â€œAnd I would like to do some of the cleaning.â€ â€œI shall do the cleaningâ€ said Mrs S. â€œ& you will do the kitchen.â€ These remarks were shot at each other, & plainly represented much previous argument, though why Mrs S., so compact, if sly, had come into touch with Miss I., so wild, with her staring blue eyes & her wideawake, I could not say. An indefinable aroma of sordidity, instability, shadiness, shiftiness pervaded them. They were sure, I think almost at once, that we had seen through them, & that the place was not for them. â€œWe live on Saladsâ€ said Mrs S. â€œthough I am not a vegetarian.â€ Sure enough the brown holland bag which they left behind them contained a number of lettuces wrapped in paper.

Miss Rivett-Carnac is the scion of a great Indian family who let her live in Wimbledon with her mother on a pound a week. She has been through a good deal: social work; hostels; running clubs. She is about 35; a perfect lady, enough to be careless of being one; only anxious for shelter, & wages, & a little time to herself. She might doâ€”she might be a superior Walter. She has, oh dear, suffered much. And is perhaps, vengeful, acid, worn, trusty, starved of happiness.

Could anything be done to make us less popular? we ask. For instance if I pied Leonardâ€™s hairâ€”would that make his mother, Bella, Tom, Harold, Dorothy Bussy, Ellie Rendel & Ka Cox refuse to invite themselves to see us?

When I offered Miss Rivett-Carnac Â£50 yesterday it seemed to me nothing, because I was thinking that I can make that by writing 2,000 words. But 5 years ago, Â£50 was a substantial sum. How money has shrunk in my mind! This is one of the most curious things in my existenceâ€”the shrinkage of money.

A perfect September day, after some very imperfect November days; the swallows skimming the terrace; Percy asking if it will be fine tomorrow; if so, he will mow the lawn. The bees are suspected to have been busy. In that case we shall take honey tonight. L. & P. spent the afternoonâ€”Trim & Uncle Tobyâ€”mending the fence; I spent it walking the downs. I still have in spite of building a perfect stretch, & by juggling a little, can convert distant houses into haystacks.

I am reading Dante; & my present view of reading is to elongate immensely. I take a week over one canto. No hurry.

Our friends work us very hard. Heres Tom Eliot: when are you back? Hereâ€™s Miss Bartlett, may we come to tea. Heresâ€”& my two monthsâ€™ respite nibbled at by all who choose. I think I will spend August next year in Northumberland.
