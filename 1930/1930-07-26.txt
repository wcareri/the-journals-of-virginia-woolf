### Saturday 26 July

Just back from a night at Long Barn, where I retrieved that fact about Emeraldâ€™s party, waiting half an hour, all in the sulks too for the smash of their best friends. And Lady E. & Mrs S. strewed Kent with Â£62,000 worth of jewels. Jewels in their hats, round their necks: somehow this makes me less sorry for them; undemocratic though I am. I rather like thinking of pearls pendant from oak trees.

I have 15â€”no 12â€”minutes before lunch; & am all of a quiver with home coming to L., to 2 newts in the bathroom, Letters (from Ethel, & flowers) books &c. A very nice homecoming; & I daresay a sample of my life, picked out of the mass (as it is, when one comes back) makes me a little amazed at my own happiness. I daresay few women are happierâ€”not that I am consistently anything; but feel that I have had a good draught of human life, & find much champagne in it. It has not been dullâ€”my marriage; not at all.

I liked rambling over Vitaâ€™s new fields, & talking to Mrs Page about the haycrop; & then champagne for dinnerâ€”an extravagance of Haroldâ€™s; sleep in the sitting room; a log fire; dogs; aeroplanes at night; dogs again; & breakfast in bedâ€”mushroom & peach & hot bath, & so home, as I say, to the newts & Leonard. Clive will come to tea. Perhaps we may go to the play. And perhaps I might decide to have a new educated woman as servant. This comes on top of a day of Nelly Lottie & Mrs Mansfield. Their jokes their presence their familiarity, wh. rouse the usual reflections.

Passing the public House this Sunday afternoon, the buzz of voices through the door was exactly the same as at an evening party. My first thought was censorious: people in public houses. But this was soon corrected. I dont see much difference between the Marchmont Arms & Argyle House; or 3 Albert Road if it comes to that; except that we drink champagne & wear satin, & I sit between Lord Gage & Bernstorf.
