### Sunday 23 November

Ethel yesterday in a state of wonderment at her own genius. â€œCant think how I happenedâ€ she says, putting on my hat, & bidding me observe what a nutshell it is on top of her gigantic brow. Another observation, based on parties at Rhonddaâ€™s & lunch with Harold: given clothes I could soon dine & lunch every day & get so easily the hang of it that it mattered nothing. And so would have no point.
