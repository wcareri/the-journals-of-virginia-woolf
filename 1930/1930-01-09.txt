### Thursday 9 January

I merely note that I am going to try to keep next week entirely free from â€˜seeingâ€™ people, bating my dinner at Bogy Harrises to meet the Prime Minister, & Angelicaâ€™s party. I am going to see if I can keep 7 days out of the clutch of the seers. I have arranged to do my seeing all this week, & have plodded along faithfully, & industriously: Braithewait & Miss Matthews, Dottie, Ottoline, Goldie, Sprot, Quentin, Miss Matheson & Plomer last night & Eddy to tea today, Vita tomorrow, Quentin on Saturday; & then nobody I swear on Sunday.
