### Tuesday 2 September

I was walking down the path with Lydia. If this dont stop, I said, referring to the bitter taste in my mouth & the pressure like a wire cage of sound over my head, then I am ill: yes, very likely I am destroyed, diseased, dead. Damn it! Here I fell downâ€”saying â€œHow strangeâ€”flowersâ€. In scraps I felt & knew myself carried into the sitting room by Maynard, saw L. look very frightened; said I will go upstairs; the drumming of my heart, the pain, the effort got violent at the doorstep; overcame me; like gas; I was unconscious; then the wall & the picture returned to my eyes; I saw life again. Strange I said, & so lay, gradually recovering till 11 when I crept up to bed. Today, Tuesday, I am in the lodge & Ethel comesâ€”valiant old woman!

But this brush with death was instructive & odd. Had I woken in the divine presence it wd. have been with fists clenched & fury on my lips. â€œI dont want to come here at all!â€ So I should have exclaimed. I wonder if this is the general state of people who die violently. If so figure the condition of Heaven after a battle.

I think one might write a fantasia called Reflections on the sight of a daddy long legs. There was one just now (I have moved in from the lodge, thus disturbing both L. & Annie) crawling over the handmade paper on wh. I have to sign my name 600 times. This bright sunny patch was his only pleasure. Yes, & then one dislikes daddies because they eat oneâ€™s plants. One has some kindness for their very few pleasures. What is oneâ€™s relation to insects?

It suddenly comes over me how I used to hook a piece of paper to me out of the nurseâ€™s eye in other illnessesâ€”what a tremendous desire to write I had.

I will use these last pages to sum up our circumstances. A map of the world.

Leaving out the subject of Nelly, which bores me, we are now much freer & richer than we have ever been. For years I never had a pound extra; a comfortable bed, or a chair that did not want stuffing. This morning Hammond delivered 4 perfectly comfortable arm chairsâ€”& we think very little of it.

I seldom see Lytton; that is true. The reason is that we dont fit in, I imagine, to his parties nor he to ours; but that if we can meet in solitude, all goes as usual. Yet what do oneâ€™s friends mean to one, if one only sees them 8 times a year? Morgan I keep up with in our chronically spasmodic way. We are all very much aware of life, & seldom do anything we do not want to. My Bell family relations are young, fertile & intimate. Julian & Quentin change so much. This year Q. is shabby easy natural & gifted; last year he was foppish, finicky & affected. Julian is publishing with Chatto & Windus. As for Nessa & Duncan I am persuaded that nothing can be now destructive of that easy relationship, because it is based on Bohemianism. My bent that way increasesâ€”in spite of the prodigious fame (it has faded out since July 15 th: I am going through a phase of obscurity; I am not a writer: I am nothing: but I am quite content) I am more & more attracted by looseness, freedom, & eating oneâ€™s dinner off a table anywhere, having cooked it previously. This rhythm (I say I am writing The Waves to a rhythm not to a plot) is in harmony with the paintersâ€™. Ease & shabbiness & content therefore are all ensured. Adrian I never see. I keep constant with Maynard. I never see Saxon. I am slightly repelled by his lack of generosity; yet would like to write to him. Perhaps I will. George Duckworth, feeling the grave gape, wishes to lunch with Nessa; wishes to feel again the old sentimental emotions. After all, Nessa & I are his only women relations. A queer cawing of homing rooks this is. I daresay the delights of snobbishness somewhat fail in later lifeâ€”& we have doneâ€”â€˜made goodâ€™â€”that is his expression.

My map of the world lacks rotundity. There is Vita. Yesâ€”She was here the other day, after her Italian tour, with 2 boys; a dusty car, sandshoes & Florentine candlepieces, novels & so on tumbling about on the seats. I use my friends rather as giglamps: Theres another field I see: by your light. Over thereâ€™s a hill. I widen my landscape.
