### Tuesday 2 December

No I cannot write that very difficult passage in The Waves this morning (how their lives hang lit up against the palace) all because of Arnold Bennett & Ethelâ€™s Party. I can hardly set one word after another. There I was for 2 hours, so it seemed, alone with B. in Ethelâ€™s little back room. And this meeting I am convinced was engineered by B. to â€˜get on good terms with Mrs Woolfâ€™â€”when heaven knows I donâ€™t care a rap if Iâ€™m on terms with B. or not. B. I say; because he canâ€™t say B. He ceasesâ€”shuts his eyesâ€”leans back. One waits. â€œbeginâ€ he at last articulates quietly, without any fluster. But the method lengthens out intolerably a rather uninspired discourse. Its true, I like the old creature: I do my best, as a writer, to detect signs of genius in his smoky brown eye: I see certain sensuality, power, I suppose: but O as he cackled out â€œwhat a blundering fool I amâ€”what a babyâ€”compared with Desmond McCarthyâ€”how clumsyâ€”how could I attack professors?â€ This innocence is engaging; but wd. be more so if I felt him, as he infers, a â€œcreative artistâ€. He said that George Moore in The Mummerâ€™s Wife had shown him the Five Towns: taught him what to see there: has a profound admiration for G.M.: but despises him for boasting of his sexual triumphs. â€œHe told me that a young girl had come to see him. And he asked her, as she sat on the sofa, to undress. And he said, she took ofâ f all her clothes & let him look at herâ€”Now that I dont believe â€¦ But he is a prodigious writerâ€”he lives for words. Now heâ€™s ill. Now heâ€™s an awful boreâ€”he tells the same stories over & over. And soon people will say of me â€œHeâ€™s deadâ€.â€ I rashly said â€œOf your books?â€ No, of meâ€”he replied, attaching, I suppose, a longer life than I do to his books.

â€œIts the only lifeâ€ he said (this incessant scribbling, one novel after another, one thousand words daily) I dont want anything else. I think of nothing but writing. Some people are bored. â€œYou have all the clothes you want, I supposeâ€ I said. â€œAnd bathsâ€”And beds. And a yacht.â€ â€œOh yes, my clothes cdnt be better cut.â€

And at last I drew Lord David in. And we taunted the old creature with thinking us refined. He said the gates of Hatfield were shut â€œshut away from lifeâ€. â€˜But open on Thursdaysâ€™ said Lord D. â€œI dont want to go on Thursdaysâ€ said B. â€œAnd you drop your aitches on purposeâ€ I said â€œthinking that you possess more â€˜lifeâ€™ than we do.â€ â€œI sometimes teaseâ€ said B. â€œBut I dont think I possess more life than you do. Now I must go home. I have to write one thousand words tomorrow morningâ€.

And this left only the scrag end of the evening: & this left me in a state where I can hardly drive my pen across the page.  
Question: Why does Desmond like talking to Lord Esher?  
Reflection: it is presumably a bad thing to look through articles, reviews &c. to find oneâ€™s own name. Yet I often do.  
Resolution: To say to Ethel one dayâ€”How can you attach this importance to everything you do when you call yourself a Christian (inspired by this mornings letter & its emphasis about the score of the Prison)
