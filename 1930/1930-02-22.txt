### Saturday 22 February

I had meant to write a sketch of Georgeâ€”Sir George Duck-worthâ€”as he announced himself to Nellyâ€”& of Lytton; both unexpected visitors yesterdayâ€”for Iâ€™m not to go down to the studio till Monday; & so must canter my pen amateurishly here; but ten minutes ago the idea came to me of a possible broadsheet; which I wd. like to adumbrate, before discussing with L. My notion is a single sheet, containing say 2,000 or if printed back & front 4,000 words. Art, politics, Lit., music: an essay by a single writer to be printed at irregular intervals; sent to subscribers; costing 6d. Sometimes only a reproduction. It should be a statement about life: something somebody wants to say; not a regular comment. Very little expense wd. be involved. It would have a spring & an urgency about it wh. the regular sheets lack. Sometimes only a picture. To be closely under L. & my thumbs, so as to give character & uniformity. To lapse for a month if necessary. No incubus of regular appearance. A circular signed by L. & me to be sent round. Young writers enlisted. Signed articles. Everything of the humblest, least ostentatious. The Hogarth News. The Broadsheet.â€”name to be decided. You see I wd. like to write on Scott this week, & cant, because Richmond has sent the book already. L. wd. do politics. Roger art. The young would have their fling. Possibly, if expenses were kept down, they could get Â£5 or so, & have their names. But they must not be essaysâ€”alwaysâ€”must be topical to some extent.

That being enough to go upon in talk after lunchâ€”& it is a fine still day & perhaps we may drive to Richmond & try my legs walkingâ€”I will obediently, like a student in the art schoolâ€”sketch Sir George. First his jowl: it is of the finest semi-transparent flesh; so that one longs to slice it, as it rests, infinitely tender, upon his collar. Otherwise he is as tight as a drum. One expects his trousers to split as he sits down. This he does slowly & rises with difficulty. Still some sentiment begins to form misty between us. He speaks of â€˜Motherâ€™. I daresay finds in me some shadowy likenessâ€”wellâ€”& then he is not now in a position to do me harm. His conventions amuse me. I suppose these family affections are somehow self-protection. He preserves a grain or two of what is meâ€”my unknown past; my self; so that if George died, I should feel something of myself buried. He is endlessly self-complacent. His stories, once started roll comfortablyâ€”he is immensely comfortableâ€”into the pocket of his solid self esteem. I ask, What about the hogs (the Chesterfield hogs) & he replies that the cowmanâ€™s wife has had a very long labour. Margaret has been very worried. Dalingridge was lit up all night. They had to use the telephoneâ€”to send for the dr. The womans mother slept in the houseâ€”& so it goes on, singing cosily & contentedly the praises of the good master & mistressâ€”which I have no doubt they are. And he trots out his little complimentsâ€”asked to be Sheriff. And he wishes to know if I am making fabulous sumsâ€”& he chuckles & dimples & respects me for being asked to a party by the Lord Mayor. And he twits Eddy Marsh for being fond of the society of the great. And he deplores the nudity of Nessaâ€™s picturesâ€”& so prattles & chortles & gives me turtle soup & advises about the preparation & so takes himself off, to meet Henry & return to Dalingridge & the cowman & the hogsâ€”a very incestuous raceâ€”& his cook Janet & his Bronnie, home on leave from the Navyâ€”well, it does appear as if human life were perfectly tolerable; his voltage is absolutely normal. The world has been made for him.

Lytton came in after dinner. Very twinkly, lustrous, easy & even warm. Leonard made cigarettes. I lay on the sofa in the twilight of cushions. Lytton had been sent a book about Columbus & told us the story making it into a fantastic amusing Lytton bookâ€”Columbus a mad religious fanatic who sailed west & west because he had read in Isaiah a prophesy; his crew being convicts let out from prison; & they came to Cuba & he made them sign a statement that this was India, because it was too large to be an island; & they picked up gold & gems & went back to Spain & the King & Queen rose as he came in. Here are all the elements of a Lytton concoction, told with great gusto; irony; a sense of the incongruous & dramatic. Then we warbled melodiously about Dadie, & Cambridge; & Charlie; & so on. He has a new gramophone. He is editing Greville. He is very content tooâ€”not for Georgeâ€™s reasons; & very well equipped, & buys books; & likes us; & is going to Cambridge this week end. Its odd how little one remembers what is actually said. I am thinking of the new paper.
