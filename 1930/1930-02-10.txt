### Monday 10 February

Charlie Sanger died yesterday, the very fine cold day, when we were driving up. I feel sorry in gusts. I wish we had dined there. I shall miss some peculiar thingâ€”loyal, worn, romantic; flowing with affection. He knew us when Thoby died; had always clasped my hand warmly, sat sparking, glittering, elfish; very sympathetic, very serious, in the right way. He had a stern view, I think; had found life hard; & envisaged its hardness for others. Yes; I have a peculiar feeling for himâ€”can one say more? And this is the sorrow for himâ€”feeling one will never again have that. (I cant analyseâ€”have indeed a slight temperature, & am in two minds if it is influenza, & whether to tell Leonard, who has had itâ€”to put off Ethel Smyth, & Nessaâ€”to go to bedâ€”what is the sensible thing to do?
