### Sunday 26 January

I am 48: we have been at Rodmellâ€”a wet, windy day again; but on my birthday we walked among the downs, like the folded wings of grey birds; & saw first one fox, very long with his brush stretched; then a second; which had been barking, for the sun was hot over us; it leapt lightly over a fence & entered the furzeâ€”a very rare sight. How many foxes are there in England? At night I read Lord Chaplinâ€™s life. I cannot yet write naturally in my new room, because the table is not the right height, & I must stoop to warm my hands. Everything must be absolutely what I am used to.

I forgot to say that when we made up our 6 months accounts, we found I had made about Â£3,020 last yearâ€”the salary of a civil servant: a surprise to me, who was content with Â£200 for so many years. But I shall drop very heavily I think. The Waves wont sell more than 2,000 copies. I am stuck fast in that bookâ€”I mean, glued to it, like a fly on gummed paper. Sometimes I am out of touch; but go on; then again feel that I have at last, by violent measuresâ€”like breaking through gorseâ€”set my hands on something central. Perhaps I can now say something quite straight out; & at length; & need not be always casting a line to make my book the right shape. But how to pull it together, how to compost itâ€”press it into oneâ€”I do not know; nor can I guess the endâ€”it might be a gigantic conversation. The interludes are very difficult, yet I think essential; so as to bridge & also give a backgroundâ€”the sea; insensitive natureâ€”I dont know. But I think, when I feel this sudden directness, that it must be right: anyhow no other form of fiction suggests itself except as a repetition at the moment.

Lord Buckmaster sat next me. I was talking to Desmond about Irene. Suddenly Ethel said leaning across,

But did you ever know Lord Tennyson? & my evening was ruined. Typical of these parties.
