### Sunday 2 November

And tonight the final letter to Nelly is to be sent; there it rests in my red bag, but I have great reluctance to read it over, as I had to write it. Yet I donâ€™t suppose she will mind acutely. For one thing, she has been prepared, I think, by our readiness to do without her; & then since the famous scene last November I think she has been aware of a change. These 5 months at any rate have proved that we are freer, easier & no less comfortable, indeed more comfortable, without her, for all her good humour, sense & niceness; which now that I have written the letter, I see once more in their true proportions. And I am vague & in the air, because I doubt that Annie will comeâ€”doubt if she shouldâ€”wish indeed to have livers out in future. Oh never again to have scenes with servantsâ€”that is my ambition. How we used to walk round the Sqre considering Nellyâ€™s ultimatums; what hours we have spent & should still spend. No: this is a wholesome break, & takes 10 years off my shoulders. Oh, but I shall have to see herâ€”
