Spain strikes. Illness of M. Poincare. Suicide of Peter Warlock. Dyestuff Bill.

Lord David, Lytton & Clive last night. Told them how I had burnt my evening dress in the gas fireâ€”general agreement that parties are a folly. Clive specially emphatic. Talk about the riddle of the universe (Jeansâ€™ book) whether it will be known; not by us; found out suddenly: about rhythm in prose; Lytton is bringing out a new book of essays; what shall it be called; on living abroad; Clive says we (L. & I) are provincial. I say no mud abroad & fireflies in oneâ€™s hair; Blenheim discussed; Lytton against it; Clive in favour; I say no sense of human personality; Lord Davidâ€™s aunt perpetually tears up her life of Ld Salisbury; feels the cause of the lunatics; no Cecils like dogs; Q.V. discussed; Bitter tea; A Lion rages; Cliveâ€™s eyes; Ld D. sneezed across the table; my bag came; fog all day.
