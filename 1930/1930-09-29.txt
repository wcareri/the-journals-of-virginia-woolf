### Monday 29 September

So all those days were completely ruined by the assiduity of our friends. When one has to tidy the table, pick fresh flowers, collect chairs & be ready, at 4, or at one, to welcome, & all the rest of it the circumjacent parts of the day are ruined. On the whole L.â€™s family do the trick most thoroughly. Everything is such an effort; so unreal; what I say is so remote from what I feel; their standards are so different from mine; I strain myself perpetually with trying to provide the right cakes, the right jokes, the right affection & inquiries. Naturally it often goes wrong, as on Friday. Harold, who is to me the most sympathetic of them, told a story of the Woolf temper; how Philip had broken down the servants bedroom door in a rage, because they had put a bottle, unfastened, into Babâ€™s bed, & refused to come & make it. Mrs W. who is the vainest of women (poor old ladyâ€”yes, ones feeling of poor old woman churns & muddles all oneâ€™s feelings of her egotism, her vanity) took this as a slur upon herself; & began querulously & peevishly to defend her methods of education, & to pay herself the usual compliments upon her wonderful management of so many fatherless & penniless children. And then of course she requires to have these praises corroborated, & will not be satisfied until I have also wondered & exclaimed at her amazing unselfishness & courage & agreed that the Woolf temper is merely a proof of their intelligence. Here of course, I begin to see very plainly how ugly, how nosey, how irreparably middle class they all are. Indeed, my aesthetic sense is the one that protests most obstinatelyâ€”how they cheapen the house & gardenâ€”How they bring in an atmosphere of Earls Court & hotels, how impossibly out of place, & stuffy & towny & dressy & dowdy they look on the terrace, among apple trees & vegetables & flowers! But there I am pinned down, as firmly as Prometheus on his rock, to have my day, Friday 26th of September 1930, picked to pieces, & made cheap & ugly & commonplace; for the sting of it is that there is no possible escapeâ€”no escape that wont make old Mrs Woolf begin to dab her eyes & feel that she is not being welcomedâ€”she who is so â€œpainfully sensitiveâ€â€”so fond of cakes, so incapable of amusing herself, so entirely without any interest in my feelings or friends; so vampire like & vast in her demand for my entire attention & sympathy, while she sits over the fire, in her dreary furs & ugly bonnet & large boots, with her pendulous cheeks & red nose & cheap earrings, talking about Worthing & the charms of Dr Watson & the niceness of everybody, & how she will come to Worthing every year, & will expect to come to tea with us. Lord Lord! how many daughters have been murdered by women like this! What a net of falsity they spread over life. How it rots beneath their sweetnessâ€”goes brown & soft like a bad pear!

At the same time I cannot make out a case for myself as a maltreated person. No, because I have an interest beyond my own nose. But let me note that old age can only be made tolerable by having a firm anchor outside gossip, cakes, & sympathy. Think of imposing even one afternoon of such a burden upon Quentin Julian & Angelica! I shall spend my day at the British Museum. (This is one of those visual images, without meaning when written down, that conveys a whole state of mind to me)

Rodmell is full of incident, drama, &, sometimes I think, coming home over the flats, of beauty & solemnity. Mr Fears the epileptic died on Thursday. He had been locked in his room for weeks; but escaped, made off to Southease, & called on the Thomases to present his grievance to the Rector. One of his grievances was that Mrs Dedman had stolen part of his gardenâ€”& it is saidâ€”& I can believe itâ€”that this was no figment. There she stands in the street, ominous, glum, predatory, grasping, complaining. Then a doctor taps at the window: someone has been taken ill in the street & carried into a cottage. It was the mother of Miss Emery the dog breeder. She now lies dying perhaps, & her husband must be taken for a motor drive while they are burying Mr Fears to distract him from the thought of death. It is the most miserable of days, cold & drizzling, the leaves falling; the apples fallen; the flowers sodden; mist hiding Caburn. Yet I have written well, & cannot make out a case for myself as a maltreated person.

The great game of diplomacy is begun with Nelly. I have told Dr McGlashan that we will pay her wages, but not have her back till she is well.
