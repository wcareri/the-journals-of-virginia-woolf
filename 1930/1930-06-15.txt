### Sunday 15 June

How many skips there are here! Nothing said of our tour through the West; nothing said of N.â€™s operation; of Taupin, who lost my key broke tumblers & cooked with the faded inspiration of one who had been a good cook; & nothing said of the divine relief of my quiet evenings, without servants; & how we dine out at the Cock; & how we say, canâ€™t this last? & then how I rang up Mrs Walters; & that experiment, an arduous one, begins tomorrow. Leonard is not apt at a crisis. I mean his caution sticks his back up. He foresees obstacles. He has a philanthropic side too, which I distrust. Must be good to dependants. I am too hurried to spread these notes wider. At anyrate, Mrs W. an American who wishes to work, has been a journalist, is an intellectual, comes into our service tomorrow; being, as it were, Miss Ritchie, or Lyn Eirven. I have to give her orders; & she has to empty the slops. Will it work? will it last? Anyhowâ€”every sentence begins anyhowâ€”an interesting experience.
