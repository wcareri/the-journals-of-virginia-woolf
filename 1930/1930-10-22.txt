### Wednesday 22 October

Just back from headache cheatingâ€”there should be a name for these peregrinationsâ€”at Hampton Court, My misery at the sere & yellow leaves, & the ships coming in & I not there & I not thereâ€”drove me to take a day off; indeed to plan 2 days off; but no: it rains now; & Iâ€™m for the fire.

My misery is Leonardâ€™s. Rivett cant cook. Poor woman! Bowed down with a sense of the failure of her life, creeping broken winged, arid, deprecatory, diffident, she sends in meagre savourless dishes & attempts nervous combinations of tapioca & orange. No, no: go she must. And then I think Annieâ€”for ever. But the misery of these trifles can be devastating. Brown sole, brown sauce, & nothing else. And when I make a joke she laughs, as she laughed once in some tennis court to some subaltern I imagine, vainly. She is inveâ rtebrate; crushed; & what, I ask, is to become of her? And how am I to detach her seaweed clinging from my kitchen? For naturally this was a chance, a new start for her; something untried. And when I say No you canâ€™t cook, she will see her hope go bang like a rabbit in a shooting gallery. And I detest these dislodgments. Nelly again yesterday: apprehensive & suspicious; though I think not shaken seriously in her belief that she will come back to her. Thank the Lord, it rains, & I can bring myself to heel easily now. Winter has set in; draw the curtains; light the fire; & so to work.
