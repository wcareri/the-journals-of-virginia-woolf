### Sunday 18 May

The thing is now to live with energy & mastery, desperately. To despatch each day high handedly. To make much shorter work of the day than one used. To feel each like a wave slapping up against one. So not to dawdle & dwindle, contemplating this & that. To do what ever comes along with decision; going to the Hawthornden prize giving rapidly & lightheartedly; to buy a coat; to Long Barn; to Angelicaâ€™s School; thrusting through the mornings work (Hazlitt now) then adventuring. And when one has cleared a way, then to go directly to a shop & buy a desk, a book case. No more regrets & indecisions. That is the right way to deal with life now that I am 48: & to make it more & more important & vivid as one grows old.

This is all very well; but what if Nelly then gets taken ill with her kidneys, must have an operation. Soberly & seriously a whole fortnight has been blown from my life; because I have had to hang about to see Elly, to buy food, to arrange with Taupin, to arrange with the hospital; to go there in an ambulance. My mind in order to work needs to be stretched tight & flat. It has been broken into shivers. With great plodding I have managed to write about the Womenâ€™s Guild. And I consider setting to work on The Waves. I have had over 6 weeks holiday from it. Only again, this morning is ruined because I sit waiting a char, who does not come. And we have Lyn & Sir R. Storrs to tea.
