### Monday 27 October

How comfortless & uneasy my room is,â€”a table all choked with papers. &c. Iâ€™m now grinding out Waves again, & have perhaps an hour & a half to spend: a short time on Dante; a short time on MSS: a short time hereâ€”with another pen. Yesterday we went to Warlingham & sat in a gravel pit, like a Cezanne. I made this comparison, to appease myself for not being in France. And we walked along a bridle path; & saw old quiet farms, & rabbits, & downs, all preserved as by a magic ring from Croydon. Never was the division between London & country so sharp. Home, & made dinner; & read MSS: But rather casually & unanimously we have decided within the last week to stop the Press. Yes; it is to come to an end. That is we are to go on only with my books & Ls. & Dotty perhaps; & what we print ourselves. In short, we shall revert next October to what we were in the Hogarth House daysâ€”an odd reversal, seeing that we are now financially successful. But whatâ€™s money if you sell freedom? we say. And whatâ€™s the point of publishing these innocuous novels & pamphlets that are neither good nor bad? So we make this decision, casually, walking round the Square after lunch & thus slip another shackle from our shoulders. This is what I call living with a pilot in the shipâ€”not mere drifting ahead.
