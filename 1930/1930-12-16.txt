### Tuesday 16 December

I will never dine out again. I will burn my evening dress. I have gone through this door. Nothing exists beyond. I have taken my fence: & now need never whip myself to dine with Colefax, Ethel, Mary again.

These reflections were hammered in indelibly last night at Argyll House. The same party: same dresses; same food. To talk to Sir Arthur about Q.Â V.â€™s letters, & the dyestuff bill, & I forgetâ€”I sacrificed an evening alone with Vita, an evening alone by myselfâ€”an evening of pleasure. And so it goes on perpetually. Lord & Lady Esher, Arnold Bennettâ€”old Birrell. Forced, dry, sterile, infantile conversation. And I am not even excited at going. So the fence is not only leapt, but fallen. Why jump?
