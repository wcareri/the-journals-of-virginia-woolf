### Friday 4 April

I am trying to sketch my last chapterâ€”unsuccessfully; so will use 10 minutes to note my observations at Raymondâ€™s. Chiefly upon the atmosphere of buggery. Lyttonâ€™s face lit up with love & rapture when I deserted the delightful women, with all their gifts, for Mr Williamson, brilliant & beautiful, but unknown, of Oxford. Raymond sat on the arm of Lyttonâ€™s chair. Morgan came in from Meleager. And I went to see Ronnie behind the scenes. He was looking very nice in shorts. Eddy came in from Cochranâ€™s latest. He had had to stand & was (I am making up The Waves) peevish, (humour is what it lacks). Anyhow, he said, Ensor (I forget) looked very pretty in a white suitâ€”the rest oh so hideous. At this the other buggers pricked their ears & became somehow silly. I mean rather giggly & coy. An atmosphere entirely secluded, intimate, & set on one object; all agreed upon the things they liked. Raymond barked once or twice rudely (he is underbred, in voice anyhow) his feeling that I was noting, scoffing. Told me how Gerbault loathed women; then protested that I was not to believe all the stories of Dâ€™Annunzio & Duse: there was another side; she had maltreated him. A protest; raucous, & obtrusive. A photograph of Stephen Tennant (Siegfried Sassoon goes to the same dressmaker) in a tunic, in an attitude was shown about; also little boys at a private school. Morgan became unfamiliar, discussing the beauties of Hilton Youngâ€™s stepson. â€œHis skating is magnificentâ€ (then in an undertone deploring some womanâ€™s behaviour). This all made on me a tinkling, private, giggling, impression. As if I had gone in to a menâ€™s urinal.
