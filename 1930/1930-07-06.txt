### Sunday 6 July

And to tell the truth in the 15 minutes that remain before I go up to Mrs Walterâ€™s cold & exquisite but rather expensive lunchâ€”to tell the truth I am slightly annoyed, both with Margaret & with Mr Birrell. Those were two kind acts of mine: the Womenâ€™s Guild article & the article on B. Neither has thanked me. M. sent a postcard. Yet I spent two or even 3 weeks on that Letter; & worked & worked. Neverâ€”this is the moralâ€”do a kindness in writing. Never agree to use oneâ€™s art as an act of friendship. And therefore refuse to write about Maurice Baring, as he wishes.

We came into Ethelâ€™s drawing room last Thursday & found a row standing against the windowâ€”the Dâ uchess of Sermoneta, M. Baring, & Joyce Wethered. Can I tell the story? I said to Maurice as we plodded after Joyceâ€”Ethel running helter skelter after her great fuzzy dogâ€”I said â€œThis is like a party in literatureâ€”like Jane Austenâ€™s box hill party.â€ There was a space & a formality & a definiteness about it that made it a real entertainmentâ€”with longueurs, with crises, with lapses, with culminations. We all had to wash. We all had to do this, to do that. Ethelâ€™s home is better than I expected. She has more beauty & even comfort about than I expected from her alpaca coat. The red & pink roses were thick on the walls. The flowers were lush in the beds. All was glowing & bright. She has white rough cast walls; & no furniture that has cost more than a pound or twoâ€”much is old schoolroom furniture endeared to her by her intense egotistic imagination. â€œIt was there I sat, when Mary played the piano â€¦ And I said Mary couldnâ€™t you play G. sharp instead of G. natural â€¦ Thats the bedâ€”Virginia you will have this room when you come to stayâ€”where Sargent used to sleep, lying across: (because it is an old iron bed). And thats my father & motherâ€”she was the artistâ€¦â€

But I got the impression of a very genuine, breeze blown mind; a free, entirely energised characterâ€”no impediments no inhibitionsâ€”the freest talk with Maurice. â€œI met a nephew of yours Ethel, with two namesâ€. â€œWell you might haveâ€”with two namesâ€. No, I cant give the sense of her largeness, & space & ease & good breeding & character. She is, oddly, much more expert as a hostess than as a guest; doesnâ€™t talk too much; is penetrating & quick, & has this delicious ease in summoning, conjuring up, people, like Lady Balfour & Mrs Lyttelton from the neighbourhood. They sat on the sofa while I, sipping champagne, talked fast & furious to Maurice B. who turned lobster colour & trembled, & chattered about his books. There were 5 people who used to help me: all are now dead. He has had his sorrows: I dont know what: loved ladies, I daresay.
