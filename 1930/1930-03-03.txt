### Monday 3 March

Rodmell again. My new bedroom again. Children playing in the school. A thick pearl grey blue day; water drops on the window. Suppose health were shown on a thermometer I have gone up 10 degrees since yesterday, when I lay, mumbling the bones of Dodo: if it had bones; now I sit up, but cannot face going down & bringing an MS to read. Curiosity begins to stir all the same. Such is the effect of 24 hours here, & one ramble for 30 minutes on the flats. The sun wells up, like a pulse, behind the clouds. Tremendous shoals of birds are flying,â€”& the flop eared trains meeting as usual under Cabum.

Molly Hamilton writes a dâ€”d bad novel. She has the wits to construct a method of telling a story; & then heaps it with the dreariest, most confused litter of old clothes. When I stop to read a page attentively I am shocked by the dishabille of her English. It is like hearing cooks & scullions chattering; she scarcely articulates, dashes it off, I imagine, on blocks of paper, on her knee, at the House of Commons perhaps; or in the Tube. And the quality of the emotion is so thick & squab, the emotions of secondrate women painters, of spotted & pimpled young men: I dont know how she conveys such a sense of the secondrate without gift: the soft pedal too, & the highminded pedal; & no wit; & not precision; & no word standing alone, but each flopping on to the shoulder of anotherâ€”Lord what a style! What a mind. It has energy & some abilityâ€”chiefly shown in the method; but that breaks down; & that too is laboriously lifted. Now being still flabby in the march of the mind, I must read Sea Airâ€”a good manuscript.
