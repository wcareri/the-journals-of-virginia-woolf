### Saturday 4 January

This is the new year, & I shall continue this bookâ€”from economy. I am having a holiday; it is fine; & so inveterate an habitual am I, I find it easier to walk after lunch than before. Far from doing nothing, I intend to write some letters, & have been pondering the early works of Miss Easedale.

The idea has come to us that we will live here from April onwards. And merely because of that idea, the view from my window looks different. It becomes usualâ , something for a long unstressed time; hitherto I have always seen it as an interlude; a breathing space. I note, for that Portrait of Nelly that I should write, if I were editing these pages, that her letter to me began Dear Madamâ€”which I hold to be as Carlyle used to say â€œSignificant of muchâ€. But these are notes merely; for some reason it bores me to enlarge.

Vita came yesterday with a green glass tank in which Japanese flowers expand in water. Here my mind would expand like thatâ€”the advent of the Keynesâ€™ made it shrivel. And we wasted our fine day, that should have been spent at Rye, talking in their very ugly room. But I am not saying that they are ugly: that would be blasphemous. This perpetual denigration of human nature & adoration of solitude is suspect. Only, here Iâ€™m bound to the board, like an insect, for another three months; & my one fine day I grudge to society. Tonight we dine at Charleston & so home tomorrow to the pump, to the dance music; to Braithewaite, Goldie, Ottoline, Sprott & so onâ€”to be â€˜seenâ€™ to â€˜seeâ€™. A little music thoughâ€”the operaâ€”that I shall like. And now I must answer letters & so start London free from that anyhow.
