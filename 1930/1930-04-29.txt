### Tuesday 29 April

And I have just finished, with this very nib-full of ink, the last sentence of The Waves. I think I should record this for my own information. Yes, it was the greatest stretch of mind I ever knew; certainly the last pages; I dont think they flop as much as usual. And I think I have kept starkly & ascetically to the plan. So much I will say in self-congratulation. But I have never written a book so full of holes & patches; that will need re-building, yes, not only re-modelling. I suspect the structure is wrong. Never mind. I might have done something easy & fluent; & this is a reach after that vision I had, the unhappy summerâ€”or three weeksâ€”at Rodmell, after finishing The Lighthouse. (And that reminds meâ€”I must hastily provide my mind with something else, or it will again become pecking & wretched,â€”something imaginative, if possible, & light; for I shall tire of Hazlitt & criticism after the first divine reliefâ€”. & I feel pleasantly aware of various adumbrations in the back of my head; a life of Duncan: no, something about canvases glowing in a studio: but that can wait.)

I must run upstairs & peep in & tell Leonard & ask about Lottie, who has been after a place; & by the way injured yesterdays lap I am afraid with her vicissitudes.

Pm. And, I think to myself as I walk down Southampton Row â€œAnd I have given you a new book.â€
