### Wednesday 23 April

This is a very important morning in the history of The Waves, because I think I have turned the corner & see the last lap straight ahead. I think I have got Bernard into the final stride. He will go straight on now, & then stand at the door; & then there will be a last picture of the waves. We are at Rodmell, & I daresay I shall stay on a day or two (if I dare) so as not to break the current & finish it. O Lord & then a rest; & then an article; & then back again to this hideous shaping & moulding. There may be some joys in it all the same.
