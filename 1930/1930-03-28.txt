Yes, but this book is a very queer business. I had a day of intoxication when I said Children are nothing to this: when I sat surveying the whole book complete, & quarrelled with L. (about Ethel Smyth) & walked it off, felt the pressure of the formâ€”the splendour & the greatnessâ€”asâ€”perhaps, I have never felt them. But I shanâ€™t race it off in intoxication. I keep pegging away; & find it the most complex, & difficult of all my books. How to end, save by a tremendous discussion, in which every life shall have its voiceâ€”a mosaicâ€”a â€”â€”. I do not know. The difficulty is that it is all at high pressure. I have not yet mastered the speaking voice. Yet I think something is there; & I propose to go on pegging it down, arduously, & then re-write, reading much of it aloud, like poetry. It will bear expansion. It is compressed I think. It isâ€”whatever I make of itâ€”a large & potential themeâ€”wh. Orlando was not perhaps. At any rate, I have taken my fence.

Home from tea with Nessa & Angelica. A fine spring day. I walked along Oxford St. The buses are strung on a chain. People fight & struggle. Knocking each other off the pavement. Old bareheaded men; a motor car accident; &c. To walk alone in London is the greatest rest.
