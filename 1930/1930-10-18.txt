### Saturday 18 October

But behold, I think the spirit of delight is hovering over me, after 2 days at Rodmell, in spite of Ethel Smyth, in spite of Emmie Fisher. Two teasing & tormenting letters from them were, of course, forwarded. But we walked to Lewes over the fieldsâ€”yes, reached our goal, came out under that tunnel; now I have planned this walk for almost 20 years & never taken it. Home now, & find another letter, shaken & remorseful from Ethel, & Tomâ€™s new edition of Johnson, & ever so many flowers.
