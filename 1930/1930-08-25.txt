### Monday 25 August

Ethel came for a night on Friday, & in order to drown Percyâ€™s mowing I will write here; for the friction of writing is a protection; & the dogs & the spire have been bad today. But they are bad because I am re-writing Hazlitt; having stopped The Waves at the break; & I am happy; & it is a very hot day; & we have been into Lewes, & I walked home part of the way. This is the only really hot day we have had. But I wish if I can to describe Ethel. At least let me pelt in a few notes of this curious unnatural friendship. I say unnatural because she is so old, & everything is incongruous. Her head is an enormous size over the temples. Music is there, she said, tapping her temples. That way lies insanity. What Walter said; what Wach (or someone) saidâ€”she cannot refrain from repeating what I guess to be very worn compliments, often repeated to herself at dead of night. For she cannot get over unfortunately her own ill-treatment. A refrain occurs; & it is all the more marked for being in contrast with the generosity, sense, balance, & shrewdness of all else. Off her own music, & the conspiracy against herâ€”for the Press are determined to burke her, though she fills every hallâ€”thats the line of itâ€”she is an admirable guest. Oh yes & more. I went through some odd vicissitudes, in the way of emotion. Lying in my chair in the firelight she looked 18; she looked a young vigorous handsome woman. Suddenly this vanishes; then there is the old crag that has been beaten on by the waves: the humane battered face that makes one respect human nature: or rather feel that it is indomitable & persistent. Then, she is worldly; by which I mean something I like; unembarrassed, aired, sunned, acquainted with this way of life & that; lived in many societies; taken her own way in shirt & tie vigorously unimpeded; then I am conscious, I suppose, of the compliment she pays me. But then she is over 70. And (oh the dogsâ€”oh Percy!â€”& I had marked off such a lovely eveningâ€”what am I to do?) She is sometimes startlingly quick. She has a lightning speed of perception which I liken to my own. But she is more robust; better grounded on fact than I am. She takes in a situation in one word. I told her about Margaret & my difficulties with the paper. No woman of 30 could have seen so swiftly or put the matter more succinctly in a nutshell, (her fault as a talker is diffusity). I had some interesting moments. About jealousy for instance. â€œDâ€™you know Virginia, I dont like other women being fond of you.â€ â€œThen you must be in love with me Ethelâ€. â€œI have never loved anyone so muchâ€ (Is there something senile in this? I dont know). â€œEver since I saw you I have thought of nothing else &c. I had not meant to tell you.â€ But I want affection. â€œYou may take advantage of thisâ€. No. Well, this, so far as I can boil it down, is Ethelâ€™s state. But what I like in her is not I think her love for how difficult it is to make that intelligibleâ€”it is compact of so many thingsâ€”she exaggeratesâ€”I am sensitive to exaggerationâ€”what I like is the indomitable old crag; & a certain smile, very wide & benignant. But dear me I am not in love with Ethel. And oh yesâ€”her experience.
