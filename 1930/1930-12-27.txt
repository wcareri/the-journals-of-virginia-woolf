### Saturday 27 December

But whats the use of talking about Bernardâ€™s final speech? We came down on Tuesday, & next day my cold was the usual influenza, & I am in bed with the usual temperature, & cant use my wits or, as is visible, form my letters. I daresay 2 days will see me normal; but then the sponge behind my forehead will be dry & paleâ€”& so my precious fortnight of exaltation & concentration is snatched; & I shall go back to the racket & Nelly without a thing done. I cheer myself by thinking that I may evolve some thoughtsâ . Meanwhile it rains; Annieâ€™s child is ill; the dogs next door yap & yap; all the colours are rather dim & the pulse of life dulled. I moon torpidly through book after book: Defoeâ€™s Tour; Rowanâ€™s autoâ biograpâ hy; Bensonâ€™s Memoirs; Jeans; in the familiar way. The parsonâ€”Skinnerâ€”who shot himself emerges like a bloody sun in a fog. a book worth perhaps looking at again in a clearer mood. He shot himself in the beech woods above his house; spent a life digging up stones & reducing all places to Camelodunum; quarrelled; bickered; yet loved his sons; yet turned them out of doorsâ€”a clear hard picture of one type of human lifeâ€”the exasperated, unhappy, struggling, intolerably afflicted. Oh & Iâ€™ve read Q.V.â€™s letters; & wonder what wd. happen had Ellen Terry been born Queen. Complete disaster to the Empire? Q.V. entirely unaesthetic; a kind of Prussian competence, & belief in herself her only prominences; material; brutalâ  to Gladstone; like a mistress with a dishonest footman. Knew her own mind. But the mind radically commonplace, only its inherited force, & cumulative sense of power, making it remarkable.
