### Wednesday 5 November

These are further notes about Nelly, since it is a queer little bit of life broken off; servant psychology & so on. To my long, explicit & affectionate letter she has returned one word: Dear Mr & Mrs Woolf. Thank you for your cheque: Yrs truly.

But yesterday evening, an embittered, frightened angry voice, this is Rivettâ€™s description, & by the sound she identified Nelly, was heard on the telephone. She asked for me; but I was, happily, out or down here. We conjecture that after launching her snub, she came up to consult Lottie, perhaps see Mrs Hunt, & for some reason they decided upon an interview. I imagine she has now gone back. And the sense of freedom spreads wider & wider. The letter is sent; the shock over. And I come in & find the house empty & silent.

A slight inaccuracy, if applied to the past few days. Ethel Lyn & Hugh Walpole to tea on Monday; Vita Clive & Hilda Matheson to dine; Hugh again later, & his piteous, writhing & wincing & ridiculous & flaying alive story of Willie Maughamâ€™s portrait. Indeed it was a clever piece of torture; Hugh palpably exposed as the hypocritical booming thick skinned popular novelist, who lectures on young novelists & makes his own books sell: who is thick fingered & insensitive in every department. But said Hugh, turning round on his bed of thorns again & yet again, & pressing them further & further in, Thats not what I mind so much. What I mind are a few little thingsâ€”little things Willie & I had togetherâ€”only he & I knewâ€”those he has put into print. Thats what I cant get over. For instance I cant tell you all the meanings there are to me in his saying I was like a man in love with a duchessâ€”(the meaning is that Hugh is in love with a male opera singer). Would you mind Virginia? (this said past midnight, Vita & I alone) And I said I should. â€œAnd he wrote to me & said he could not believe that I could be hurt. He said he had written without a thought of me. But that letter is almost worse than the book.â€

Clive is home blind of one eye & much in need of society. I thought him, why heaven knows, rather admirable & touching; determined not to be a burden on his friends, yet very grateful for our kindness (& I must ask him to come in tonight). So much instructed somehow in the little graces & also the inevitable lonelinesses, without his Mary, but then I think he has his Joan. And he cant read or write, & has hired a reader. Its the evenings that will be bad he said. Nessa characteristically writes from Cassis that she doesnâ€™t think much of it, & supposes that spectacles, â€˜which we all wearâ€™ will put it right.

And Julianâ€™s poems are out, & I am relievedâ€”but why, vanity of my own critical powers? jealousy of his fame?â€”to hear that Vita agrees with me that for all his admirable good sense & observation & love of country life, he is no poet. People who treat words as he does rather afflict meâ€”I say this to discharge me partially of vanity & jealousy. Common sense & Cambridge are not enough, whatever Bunny may say.
