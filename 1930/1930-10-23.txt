### Thursday 23 October

Behold, the rather familiar experimentâ€”a new pen, new ink. â€œIâ€™m afraid maâ€™amâ€, said the youth at Partridge & Cooperâ€™s, â€œthat the Penkalaâ€™s are extinct.â€ A voice on the telephone had spoken their doom. I went along Faringdon market this afternoon looking for the man with the barrow. I saw the grey towers of, I suppose, Smithfield. I almost went into St Paulâ€™s & saw Dr Donne, now uncovered again; but being as I say to myself, pressed for time, I walked on, down the Strand.

Ethel came in yesterday evening; rather battered in an old moleskin coat; in the triangular hat which the hotel proprietor at Bath has made into its shape with a few pins. Well, I begin to make note of her, because, among other thingsâ€”how many othersâ€”she said would I like her to leave me some of her lettersâ€”the Maggie Benson & Mrs Benson & Lady Ponsonby letters in her will? Would you like me to write something about you? I said. Oh yes; what fun! But I should try some experiments. Oh what fun! How I should enjoy it! But I should get it all wrong. Yes, of course; or tear them up. Do just as you like. H.Â B.â€™s letters Iâ€™m leaving to Maurice Baring; but heâ€™ll do nothing. Heâ€™ll tear them up.

So I am to some extent Ethelâ€™s literary executor, a post I have always vaguely desired; & so I now make a few notes as she talks, for a portrait. One would have to bring out her enormous eagerness. She was telling me how she reads Travel books; & her eyesâ€”her blue, rather prominent eyes, positively glitter. And this is not talk about herself, or her musicâ€”simply about how people climbâ€”their adventures. Her cheeks burn too. But she looks now & then aged: she said that she was a very brave woman. It is a quality I adore. And I have it. One of the bravest things I ever did was to tell people my age. My vivacity &câ€” Everyone thinks I m 20 or 30 years younger. Wellâ€”(a characteristic word, indicating what really becomes necessaryâ€”a breakâ€”a new paragraphâ€”a wedge inserted in the flood) Wellâ€”when I wanted people to realise how long Iâ€™d waited for recognitionâ€”& have never really had itâ€”I did thatâ€”though I hated it: I told them my age, so that they couldnâ€™t go on saying Oh but she came into her ownâ€”she was recognised. This referred I think, but it is difficult to insert oneâ€™s own wedges, to the Jubilee Concert at Berlin, on which occasion Lady Jones behaved so badly. She was on her wayâ€”is now I suppose in the train or on the ship, this cold grey dayâ€”to Belfast, to conduct her Sea Songs (one of my best things) & then, directly thats done, back she comes, across the Irish channel, & returns to Woking & goes on writing about H.B.: that looming imponderable figure: who has so queer an existence; for if I ask about him Logan, Ottoline &c. say Oh a petit maitre; a drawing room philosopher; to which Logan adds the son of a dentist, & Ottoline adds, he made love to me, & I found him intolerable. This was the man who dominated Ethelâ€™s life, this wraith who wanders about in Loganâ€™s & Ethelâ€™s lives. What a strange job then to write, as I may one day, the life of a woman whose past is thus nebulous. And I have only come in time to hear about the past. Everything is past. She hopes not to live another seven years; gives me to understand that now that her last barren years have been fructified by knowing me, she can sing her nunc dimittis. Since all the fiery years of desire are over. Yet I doubt if they are quite over. Yet it is a fine spectacle, & a curious one, this old woman summing up her experience & hymning her love for H.B. as a swan song (& people say an ugly song, for they say, her musical genius is another delusionâ€”all her life then has been based on illusions; & that as I perceive when I talk to her is manifestly untrue). I must now write to the living Ethelâ€”so oneâ€™s perspective shifts.
