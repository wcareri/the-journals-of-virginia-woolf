### Thursday 28 August

It is the hottest day of the year: & so it was last year, almost on this day; & I was at Long Barn, & there was the Eton tutor, a nice young man with blue eyes white teeth & straight noseâ€”& he now lies at the bottom of a crevasse in Switzerlandâ€”this very hot eveningâ€”lies crushed beside his Mary Irving: there are the two bodies for ever. I suppose some ice drips, or shifts: the light is blue, green; or wholly black; nothing stirs round them. Frozen, near together, in their tweeds & hobnail boots there they lie. And I am here; writing in my lodge, looking over the harvest fields.

I suppose they felt whirled, like hoops; battered; senseless, after the first horror of feeling out of control.

A very violent summer.

So I said to Janie Bussy Julian & Quentin on the terrace last Sunday.

The church was finished today & the scaffolding taken down. I am reading R. Lehmann, with some interest & admirationâ€”she has a clear hard mind, beating up now & again to poetry; but I am as usual appalled by the machinery of fiction: its much work for little result. Yet I see no other outlet for her gifts. And these books dont matterâ€”they flash a clear light here & there; but I suppose no more. But she has all the gifts (I suppose) that I lack; can give story & development & character & so on.

Annie offered me a paper weight of Strahn in Scotland today in return for our paying her oculists bill.
