### Wednesday 12 November

Alas, too numb brained to go on with Bernardâ€™s soliloquy this morning. A very little weight on me brings me low. And Clive has been a little weight, added to the usual round; the dentist, shops & callers &c. So I cant write. And last night we sat through a sticky valiant evening at Hopeâ€™s. Hope liberated from all restraint by was it? Hope school girlish, voluble, excited, the first time I have seen it since Janeâ€™s death. Mrs Plunket Greene there (20 years added since we met at Savageâ€™s dinner party) now she is grey, pendulous; with the oddest bird technique of the head & eyes I have ever seenâ€”for ever craning, peering, advancing, exactly like a lively arch bird of some kind. A Roman Catholicâ€”not, unless you remembered her 20 years ago, a very nice or clever womanâ€”something too insinuating.
