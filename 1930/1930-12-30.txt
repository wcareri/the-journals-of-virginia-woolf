What it wants is presumably unity; but it is I think rather good (I am talking to myself over the fire about The Waves). Suppose I could run all the scenes together more?â€”by rhythm, chiefly. So as to avoid those cuts; so as to make the blood run like a torrent from end to endâ€”I dont want the waste that the breaks give; I want to avoid chapters; that indeed is my achievement, if any here: a saturated, unchopped, completeness; changes of scene, of mood, of person, done without spilling a drop. Now if it cd. be worked over with heat & currency thats all it wants. And I am getting my blood up. (temp. 99)

But all the same I went to Lewes, & the Keynesâ€™s came to tea; & having got astride my saddle the whole world falls into shape; it is this writing that gives me my proportions.
