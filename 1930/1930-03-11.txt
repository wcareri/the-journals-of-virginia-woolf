### Tuesday 11 March

all because I have to buy myself a dress this afternoon, & cant think what I want, I cannot read. I have written, fairly wellâ€”but it is a difficult book at Waves; but cant keep on after 12; & now shall write here, for 20 minutes.

My impressions of Margaret & Lilian at Monks House were of great lumps of grey coat; straggling wisps of hair; hats floppy & home made; thick woollen stockings; black shoes, many wraps, shabby handbags, & shapelessness, & shabbiness & dreariness & drabness unspeakable. A tragedy in its way. Margaret at any rate deserved better of life than this dishevelled & undistinguished end. They are in lodgingsâ€”as usual. Have, as usual, a wonderful Xtian Scientist landlady; are somehow rejected by active life; sit knitting perhaps & smoking cigarettes, in the parlour where they have their meals, where there is always left a dish of oranges & bananas. I doubt if they have enough to eat. They seemed to me flabby & bloodless, spread into rather toneless chunks of flesh; having lost any commerce with looking glasses. So we showed them the garden, gave them tea (& I dont think an iced cake had come Lilianâ€™s way this 6 weeks) & thenâ€”oh the dismal sense of people stranded, wanting to be energised; driftingâ€”all woollen & hairy. (It is odd how the visual impression dominates.) There is a jay blue spark in Margaretâ€™s eye, now & then, But she had not been out of the lodging for 5 weeks because of the East wind. Her mind has softened & wrinkled, sitting indoors with the oranges & cigarettes. Lilian is almost stone deaf, & mumbles & crumbles, emerging clearly only once, to discuss politics. Something has blunted Margaretâ€™s edge, rusted it, worn it, long before its time. Must old age be so shapeless? The only escape is to work the mind. I shall write a history of English literature, I think, in those days. And I shall walk. And I shall buy clothes, & keep my hair tidy, & make myself dine out. But perhaps life becomes repetitious, & one takes no trouble; is glad to be shovelled about in motor cars. M. has her tragic past. She is pathetic to me nowâ€”conciliatory & nervous where she used to be trenchant & severe. Janet she says writes endless notes; has sisters for ever staying with her to convalesce; & Emphie caught up their little white dog the other day from a wild herd of racing greyhounds, & had it bitten to death in her arms. This is the sort of adventure that only befalls elderly unmarried women, on whom it makes a tremendous & very painful impressionâ€”so defenceless are they, so unable to throw off the damp blanket that surrounds them. What I miss is colour, energy, any clear reflection of the moment. I see those thick stockings & grey hairy wraps everywhere.
