### Sunday 12 January

Sunday it is. And I have just exclaimed, And now I can think of nothing else. Thanks to my pertinacity & industry, I can now hardly stop making up The Waves. The sense of this came acutely about a week ago on beginning to write the Phantom party: now I feel that I can rush on, after 6 months hacking, & finish: but without the least certainty how its to achieve any form. Much will have to be discarded: what is essential is to write fast & not break the moodâ€”no holiday, no interval if possible, till it is done. Then rest. Then re-write.

As for keeping a week freeâ€”I am now going to visit L.â€™s mother: then to the Frys after dinner. Marjorie Strachey to tea tomorrow: Duncan, I think, on Tuesday; Vita on Friday; Angelica on Saturday; Bogey Harris Wednesday: one day remains entireâ€”Thursdayâ€”& thats the end of my week.
