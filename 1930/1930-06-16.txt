### Monday 16 June

Mrs Walters is now here. And she says â€œWhat do you want with a Char?â€ But then new brooms &c. She is not new in one sense; rather old & lined; no, younger than I am; but a hard face, I think; but I forbear to crack her kernel. The interest will be to get a new light on housekeeping. My books are now my idol. Can I manage on less? How many pints? How many pounds of butter? Oh to be rid of servantsâ€”for all the emotions they breedâ€”trust, suspicion, benevolence, gratitude, philanthropy, are necessarily bad.

And Nellie is now deposited on us for a day; turned out of hospital at a moments notice. I am amused to witness the conflict between L. & me. I hold a brief (hiddenly) for Walters; he (hiddenly) for Nelly. If the books are high, he secretly rejoices. If the food is good, I secretly denigrate Nellyâ€™s cooking. It is odd how those old scenes rankle in my mindâ€”how unwilling I am to have her back. Partly the silence is so grateful; & partly the absence of lower classes. I think with real shrinking of having her in control again. Yet she is obliging friendly affectionate; & I cannot bring myself to talk to her as I should. I am always seeing myself told to â€œleave my roomâ€.

But enoughâ€”a useful phrase.

I dont know why, but I have stinted this book. The summer is in full swing. Its elements this year are Nessa & Duncan, Ethel Smyth, Vita & re-writing The Waves. We are very prosperous. On making up half yearly accounts, we find that we each get Â£425: & next year is sure, owing to the gigantic sale of The Edwardiansâ€”it verges on the 20,000. And it is not a very good book. Ethel Smyth drops in; dropped in yesterday for instance, when I was so methodically devoting my morning to finishing the last page of type setting: On Being Ill; I heard a ring, went up, & saw an old char in her white alpaca coat; sat her down; disburdened her of cardboard boxes; full of white pinks; & looked at her rather monumental old colonelâ€™s face (girt round with an inappropriate necklace, for she was going to lunch with Beecham.) I get, generally, two letters daily. I daresay the old fires of Sapphism are blazing for the last time. In her heyday she must have been formidableâ€”ruthless, tenacious, exacting, lightning quick, confident; with something of the directness & ness of genius, though they say she writes music like an old dryasdust German music master. Her style in writing memoirs though is to her creditâ€”indeed she has ridden post haste through life; & accumulated an astonishing number of observations, with which she qualifies her conversation so as to drive L. almost frantic. One speech of hers lasted 20 minutes unbroken, he says, the other night. We were starting for a picnic at Ken Wood with Nessa & Duncan. Their sublime ineptitude made me laugh & made Ethel laugh & made Eddy peevish. There we sat in the garage, heaving, rotating, stinking. Then we stuck in Gower Street. The night drew on & the wind rose. A spot of rain descended. We heaved our way up to Hampstead. The house was cadaverous; the rhododendrons blanched. Where should we dine? Better go back to Fitzroy Stâ€”which we did, & dined off sandwiches & strawberries about 10 oâ€™clock in the highest glee. She is a game old birdâ€”an old age entirely superior in vitality to Margaretâ€™s.
