### Monday 8 September

I will signalise my return to lifeâ€”that is writingâ€”by beginning a new book, & it happens to be Thobyâ€™s birthday, I remark. He would have been, I think, 50 today.

After coming out here I had the usualâ€”oh how usualâ€”headache; & lay, like a fibre of tired muscle on my bed in the sitting room, till yesterday. Now up again & on again; with one new picture in my mind; my defiance of death in the garden.

But the sentence with which this book was to open ran â€œNobody has ever worked so hard as I doâ€â€”exclaimed in driving a paper fastener through the 14 pages of my Hazlitt just now. Time was when I dashed off these things all in the days work. Now, partly because I must do them for America & make arrangements far ahead, I spend I daresay a ridiculous amount of time, more of trouble on them. I began reading Hazlitt in January I think. And I am not sure that I have speared that little eel in the middleâ€”that marrowâ€”which is oneâ€™s object in criticism. A very difficult business no doubt to find it, in all these essays; so many; so short; & on all subjects. Never mind; it shall go today; & my appetite for criticism is, oddly, whettened. I have some gift that way, were it not for the grind & the screw & the tortureâ€”

Vita comes tomorrow; we go to Sissinghurst on Wednesday; I shall attack The Waves on Thursday. So this illness has meant two weeks breakâ€”but as I often think, seasons of silence, & brooding, & making up much more than one can use, are fertilising. I was raking my brain too hard.

Anyhow, this is the happiest summer since we had Monks House; the most satisfactory. We hope on Percyâ€™s evidenceâ€”P. was tidying old Hawkesworthâ€™s graveâ€”that the Byng Stamper farm has been bought by a horsebreeder, & all the land is to be under grassâ€”not bungalows. And Annie surprises one daily with her amenity, dexterity & sympathyâ€”the most convincing argument in favour of living out that I know. Yesterday I sent an advertisement to Time & Tideâ€”but hush! Profound secrecy is essential. The weather is September weather, bright, sunny, cool. We have a project of making my bedroom the sitting roomâ€”for the view. To let it waste, day after day, seems a crime: elderly eyes cannot waste. No, I would like to have another life, & live it in action. So I thought. looking at Caburn, & imagining the feelings of a strong young man, who was walking up it, with wife & children, & a career in the City â€¦ I think. No he was a politician; & I think he was also an Indian civil servant. He was not a writer: These are the stories one invents. And this: â€œAt the age of 50 Priestley will be saying â€œWhy donâ€™t the highbrows admire me? It isnâ€™t true that I only write for money.â€ He will be enormously rich; but there will be that thorn in his shoeâ€”or so I hope. Yet I have not read, & I daresay shall never read, a book by Priestley. And I (to solace myself) get a letter from a Mr Spender saying he cares for my praise more than for that of any criticâ€”& he sends me his poems. And I invent this phrase for Bennett & Priestley â€œthe tradesmen of lettersâ€.
