### Saturday 1 March

And then I went for a walk & brought on a headache, & so lay down again till today, Saturdayâ€”a fine dayâ€”when we propose to drive off-oh Thank God a thousand timesâ€”to Rodmell & there be at rest. This little affair has taken 3 weeks, & will land me in 4, of non-writing inexpressiveness. Yet Iâ€™m not sure that this is not the very thing for The Waves. It was dragging too much out of my headâ€”If ever a book drained me, this one does. If I had wisdom, no doubt I should potter at Rodmell for a fortnight, not writing. I shall take a look at it one of these mornings in my sunny room. One evening here I had the odd experience of perfect rest & satisfaction. All the bayonets that prod me sank. There I lay (I daresay for an hour) happy. And the quality was odd. Not an anxiety, not a stir, anywhere. No one coming. Nothing to do. All strain ceased. A supreme sailing with â€¦ through the dominion (I am quotingâ€”I think Shelleyâ€”& it makes nonsense.) This is the rarest of all my moods. I cant recall another. Perhaps at Rodmell sometimes. Everything is shut off. It depends upon having been in the stir of London for some time. Not to have to get up & see Sibyl or Ethel or anybodyâ€”what a supreme relief! And now! have a chance to brew a little quiet thought. Yesterday I was offered Â£2,000 to write a life of Boswell by Doran Heinemann. L. is writing my polite refusal this moment. I have bought my freedom. A queer thought that I have actually paid for the power to go to Rodmell & only think of The Waves by refusing this offer. If I accepted I would buy houses, tables & go to Italy; not worth it. Yesterday we went over 57 Russell Sqre wh. we may take. But I rather dread the noise & the sizeâ€”I dont know. A lovely view.
