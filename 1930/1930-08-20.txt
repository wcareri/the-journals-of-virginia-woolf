### Wednesday 20 August

Last night was Quentinâ€™s birthday. â€œAnother Quentin birthday overâ€ said Maynard, at the gate after the fireworks, counting perhaps the remaining years. The rockets went roaring up & scattered their gold grain. That is an old phrase; but I always think of grain when I see them. I can never find another. The willows were lit grey over the pond. The bonfire was forked, like branches in a wind. Nessa, in red, threw on a screen. Angelica, whirring & twirling like an old screaming witch, danced round it. â€œChildhoodâ€”true childhoodâ€ said Lydia. For some minutes everything that was said had the quality of sayings in a Tchekhov play.

I am writing while my potatoes boil. It has been a hot heavy ugly crustyâ  day; still, sulphurous; & the dogs have barked all round the village, one starting another. And the men have hammered on the spire. And I have been driven out & in. I have slept here, over an article by Vernon Lee, sent me in Ethelâ€™s daily letter. Ethelâ€™s letters are daily: for we have so much to make up. Time is short. â€œI would like to see Italy before I dieâ€ she says in todays letter. Should I curtail her & curb them? I think not. If one adventures, adventure wholly. And she is so courageous, remarkable shrewd, that it would be mere poltroonery for me to hold off for fear of ridicule (still they hammer, at 6.45.) So I let that old bonfire rage red & perhaps throw a screen on it. It is a very happy free, & indeed to me occasionally sublime summer. Yes, I think I have decided against Nelly: but dont let me rub that sore. I think I am on the back of The Waves now. Then my walks. How lovely it was exploring yesterday to the Hump! How strange that in almost 20 years I have never been that wayâ€”out along the marsh road beyond Sutton house. I see a line I might make to Lewes. I fell in & twisted my ankle. I saw an astonishing assortment of cones & angles of grey & gold down, back against back. I was very happy. I like the still, the profound slow happiness best. One day I walked to Firle, in a shower & found a 4 bladed pocket knife.

The Waves is I think resolving itself (I am at page 100) into a series of dramatic soliloquies. The thing is to keep them running homogeneously in & out, in the rhythm of the waves. Can they be read consecutively? I know nothing about that. I think this is the greatest opportunity I have yet been able to give myself: therefore I suppose the most complete failure. Yet I respect myself for writing this book. Yesâ€”even though it exhibits my congenital faults.

Janet Vaughan is engaged, & Gerald Brenan married.

Barbara last night was aged, out of her element, peevish, & very red & beaky.

Julian silent. Clive undoubtedly on a fresh tack which does not allow of intimacy with me. I make these notes waiting in vain for that very interesting remark to occur wh. was on the tip of my tongue; & will not now emerge, though I bait & wait. If one writes little notes, suddenly one thinks of something profound. I am reading Dante, & I say, yes, this makes all writing unnecessary. This surpasses â€˜writingâ€™ as I say about Shre. I read the Inferno for half an hour at the end of my own page: & that is the place of honour; that is to put the page into the furnaceâ€”if I have a furnace. Now to mash the potatoes. & L. has laid my carpet.
