A page of real life. Last night at Bogey Harrises. I came in, flung into the room in my red coat. A very painted raddled tall, pink woman (Mrs Graham Murray); & the rest, in an oval room, with painted ceiling, & booksâ€”â€œgiven me by Horne with Ben Johnsonâ€™s autographâ€”the first edition of Danteâ€”Lady Londonderry will be late; but we wont waitâ€. I have forgotten the prime ministerâ€”an unimpressive man; eyes disappointing; rather heavy; middle class; no son of the people; sunk; grumpy; self-important; wore a black waistcoat; had some mediocrity of personality. In came Lady L. very late; in ruby velvet, cut to the middle of the back, small, running, quick, current, energised. All went in to dinner, & I was too blind to read Sir Robert Vansittart on the manâ€™s card, so had to jumble for my neighbours pursuit. Never mind. They all called each other Van, Bogey, Ramsay, Eadie, across the table; engaged in governing England: A mazer bowl fingered by Roger, drew Ramsay for two minutes, rather heavily into the open; took it; looked at it, laying his shabby drab spectacle case on the table; said he had never signed any authority for the sale of the mazer to America; then lapsed into tete Ã  tÃªte with the ladiesâ€”murmuring, unresonant. And so upstairs, Ly L. running ahead, opening doors, taking us into little rooms to look at Majolica, at altarpieces. Then round the fire she started off, fluent, agreeable, hard hitting, like a rider, or Captain, without an ounce of spare flesh, telling storiesâ€”old men who had operations & were then madâ€”left their money in a muddleâ€”her own father mad for two yearsâ€”Farquhar muddling up the Fife Settlements & the Liberal Party fundâ€”all indiscreet, open, apparently; the chat of a perfectly equipped, un nonsensical, well fed, athletic woman, riding her horse at every fence. We discussed Birth Control. â€˜Dear Edie, you wont let me convert you. But when you see your miners, with those terrible illegitimate childrenâ€”

Eight in a room. One bed. What can you expect? They speak straight out to me, the old fashioned ones. Cant do anything else. What would you do? What should we do, if we lived like that? But weâ€™re not beasts. We can control ourselves. I detest Prohibition for that reason.â€™

Swept on, energetically, confidently, to the Webbs (woman sprung up beside me like a cobra) â€œOur class & yours can never meet. What difference is there? But these clever people! Yeats & Lady Gregory on a committee are hopelessâ€”but both very clever people. Cant do anything.â€

Ly L. can do whatever she wishes. She looked like an early Victorian pictureâ€”a Lawrence, I thought; a small pinched well cut face; healthy; without paint; very pink, pearls knotted about her wrists. The other woman garish, like a ruined almond tree. The rooms all set out with cases, chests, pictures objects. â€œI never give more than Â£10: I hunt about in rag & bone shops.â€ Bogy has the glazed stuffed look of the well fed bachelor. Is evidently one of those elderly comfortable men of taste & leisure who make a profession of society; a perfectly instinctive snob. Knows everyone; lunches with Lord Lascelles; has taken the measure of it all exactly; nothing to say; proficient; surly; adept; an unattractive type, with all his talk of Lords & ladies, his belief in great houses; something of a gorged look, which connoisseurs have; as if he had always just swallowed a bargain. Something airless & too tidy in the house; a plethora of altar pieces. He pads about, gorged, without anything to seek for, save in old rag & bone shops; at the crest (I suppose) of his world. I suppose that this centre to oneâ€™s mindâ€”an altarpieceâ€”is a bad one; too still & capable of acquisition. He never wants anything unattainable, I daresay: & so has feathered his nest. Roger says he has â€˜flairâ€™; Roger who looks like a ravaged scavenger & lives with sardine tins & linoleum; yes, but Rogerâ€™s house seems alive, with a living hand in it, manipulated, stretched. Why do interesting people never fix them down among objects (beautiful) & Duchesses (desirable). I tried, sitting on a priceless settee, picked up in Whitechapel for Â£10 (I never give more) to analyse my sensations. The ladies showed a perfect commercial grasp of the situation. Ramsay was tossed between them like a fish among cormorants. I had the impression that they did not rate this acquisition high; but took it as part of the days work. Ly L. had him to herself in a shaded room for an hour. Failing this, she had her claims written down to hand him.

Angelica said at the pantomime, as we watched the spangled lady dance, â€œI shall never be able to dance like that but I may be able to paint like she dances.â€
