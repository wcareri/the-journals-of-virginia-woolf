### Saturday 8 November

I pressed his hand when we said goodbye with some emotion: thinking This is to press a famous hand: It was Yeats, at Ottolineâ€™s last night. He was born in 1865 so that he is now a man of 65â€”& I am 48: & thus he has a right to be so much more vital, supple, high charged & altogether seasoned & generous. I was very much impressed by all this in action. He has grown very thick (Last time I met himâ€”& I may note that he had never heard of me & I was slightly embarrassed by O.â€™s painstaking efforts to bring me to his notice, was in 1907â€”or 8 I suppose, at dinner at 46). He is very broad; very thick; like a solid wedge of oak. His face is too fat; but it has its hatchet forehead in profile, under a tangle of grey & brown hair; the eyes are luminous, direct, but obscured under glasses; they have however seen close, the vigilant & yet wondering look of his early portraits. I interrupted a long dream story of de la Mares when I came in: about seeing Napoleon with ruby eyes & so on. Yeats was off, with vehemence even, kindling & stumbling a little, on dreams; those which have colour are rare & meanâ€”I forget what. De la Mare told another very cryptic dream about a book with circles in it; the outermost ring black, the inner blue & so on. Yeats identified this dream at once as the dream of the soul in some particular stateâ€”I forget what. Tagore had told him he said that he had dreamed once as a young man; & if he could find the dream again it would become permanent. And so on to dreaming states, & soul states; as others talk of Beaverbrook & free tradeâ€”as if matters of common knowledge. So familiar was he, that I perceived that he had worked out a complete psychology, which I could only catch on to momentarily in my alarming ignorance. De la M. had just been to the National Gallery, & had got no pleasure from the pictures. I said this flow & ebb of consciousness made all criticism unstable. He said one must go by the plusâ€™s always. Yeats said he could get nothing from Rembrandt, nothing from El Greco. He then explained our pleasure in pictures, or other works of art, by an elaborate metaphor, taken from his psychology; about the sharp edges of things being brought into contact; & the same order then coming in our consciousness: & thus our closest contact results from some sudden clicking to of edges, whichâ€”I have lost the metaphor now completely. Then, discussing what poems we could come back to unsated, I said Lycidas; De la M. said no. Not Milton for him: he could never recognise his own emotions there. Miltonâ€™s woodbine was not his woodbine, nor M.â€™s Eve his Eve. Yeats said he could not get satisfaction from Milton; it was Latinised poetry (as somebody said, Milton had (in some way irreparably) damaged the English language). This attached itself to a cosmology evidently, in which Latins & Romans play their part. And so to modern poetry, & the question of the spade. Yeats said that â€œweâ€, de la M. & himself, wrote â€˜thumbnailâ€™ poems only because we are at the end of an era. Here was another system of thought, of which I could only snatch fragments. He said that the spade has been embalmed by 30 centuries of association; not so the steam roller. The great age of poetry, Shakespeareâ€™s age, was subjective; ours is objective; civilisations end when they become objectified. Poets can only write when they have symbols. And steam rollers are not covered in symbolismâ€”perhaps they may be after 30 generations. He & de la M. can only write small fireside poems. Most of emotion is outside their scope. All left to the novelists I saidâ€”but how crude & jaunty my own theories were beside his: indeed I got a tremendous sense of the intricacy of the art; also of its meanings, its seriousness, its importance, which wholly engrosses this large active minded immensely vitalised man. Wherever one cut him, with a little question, he poured, spurted fountains of ideas. And I was impressed by his directness, his terseness. No fluff & dreaminess. Letters he said must be answered. He seemed to live in the centre of an immensely intricate briar bush; from wh. he could issue at any moment; & then withdraw again. And every twig was real to him. He also spoke about the necessity of tragedy. It is necessary to attempt the impossible; but it must be possible. All creation is the result of conflict. James Stephens, some of whose poems he much admires, & I have never read, was so poor as a boy that he used to pick up the bread thrown to the ducks & eat it. There must be tragedy in order to bring out the reverse of the soul. (This belongs to another theory about the soul & its antitype, which I vaguely remember in his poems). He said that Tom very cleverly made use of mythologies, for instance the Fisher King in the Waste Land; & mythologies are necessary. Ezra Pound writes beautifully when he uses them. Then suddenly must speak ofâ€”some common objectâ€”& at once his rhythm breaks. I said we did not talk enough, not easily & equally. He told us of men he had met in trains. I liked his transitions to dialect & humour. With men perhaps he might be coarse. He had been staying with Masefield who, to celebrate the 30th year of their friendship, had got young women to recite Yeatses lyrics at Boars Hill. Their voices had been too small for the theatre; but Yeats had been greatly touched. Judith M. is nice & good but not pretty. Hence she will have to marry a man she knows; not at first sight. And Mrs M. seemed simple & he liked her better than usual. Indeed, he seemed very cordial, very generous; having been warmed up by his 65 years; & being in command of all his systems, philosophies, poetics & humanities; not tentative any more. Hence no doubt his urbanity & generosity. Compare him with Tom for instance, who came to tea the day before, & may be, for anything I know, as good a poet. Poor Tom is all suspicion, hesitation & reserve. His face has grown heavier fatter & whiter. There is a leaden sinister look about him. But ohâ€”Vivienne! Was there ever such a torture since life began!â€”to bear her on ones shoulders, biting, wriggling, raving, scratching, unwholesome, powdered, insane, yet sane to the point of insanity, reading his letters, thrusting herself on us, coming in wavering tremblingâ€”Does your dog do that to frighten me? Have you visitors? Yes we have moved again. Tell me, Mrs Woolf, why do we move so often? Is it accident? Thats what I want to know (all this suspiciously, cryptically, taking hidden meanings). Have some honey, made by our bees, I say. Have you any bees? (& as I say it, I know I am awaking suspicion). Not bees. Hornets. But where? Under the bed. And so on, until worn out with half an hour of it, we gladly see them go. Vivienne remarked that I had made a signal that they should go. This bag of ferrets is what Tom wears round his neck.

On second thoughts, Yeats & de la Mare talk too much about dreams to be quite satisfactory. This is what makes de la Mareâ€™s stories (lent me by Ottoline) wobbly.
