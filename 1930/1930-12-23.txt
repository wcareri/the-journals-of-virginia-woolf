### Tuesday 23 December

I will make this hasty note about being robbed. I put my bag under my coat at Marshall & Snelgroveâ€™s. I turned; & felt, before I looked â€œIt is goneâ€. So it was. Then began questions & futile messages. Then the detective came. He stopped a respectable elderly woman apparently shopping. They exchanged remarks about â€˜the usual oneâ€”no sheâ€™s not here today. Its a young woman in brown fur.â€ Meanwhile I was ravaged, of course, with my own futile wishesâ€”how I had thought, as I put down my bag, this is foolish. I was admitted to the underworâ ld. I imagined the brown young woman peeping, pouncing. And it was gone my 6 poundsâ€”my two broochesâ€”all because of that moment. They throw the bags away, said the detective. These dreadful women come hereâ€”but not so much as to some of the Oxford St. shops. Fluster, regret, humiliation, curiosity, something frustrated, foolish, something jarred, by this underworâ ldâ€”a foggy eveningâ€”going home, pennilessâ€”thinking of my green bagâ€”imagining the woman rifling itâ€”her homeâ€”her husbandâ€”Now to Rodmell in the fog.
