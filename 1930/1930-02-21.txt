### Friday 21 February

No two women could be more extravagantly contraposed than Marjorie Snowden & Ethel Smyth. I was lying here at four yesterday when I heard the bell ring then a brisk tramp up the stairs; & then behold a bluff, military old woman (older than I expected), bounced into the room, a little glazed flyaway & abrupt; in a three cornered hat & tailor made suit.

â€œLet me look at youâ€.

That over, Now I have brought a book & pencil. I want to ask.

Here there was a ring at the bell. I went to look over. Then we went to tea.

First I want to make out the genealogy of your mothers family. Old Pattleâ€”have you a picture? No. Well nowâ€”the names of his daughters.

This lasted out tea. Afterwards, on the sofa, with Ethel stretching her legs out on Pinkerâ€™s basket, we talked ceaselessly till 7â€”when L. came in. We talkedâ€”she talked considerably more than I. (On the stairs going up to tea I had asked to be Virginia; about ten minutes after tea she asked to be Ethel: all was settled; the basis of an undying friendship made in 15 minutes:â€”how sensible; how rapid;) & she got off; oh about musicâ€”â€œI am said to be an egoist. I am a fighter. I feel for the underdog. I rang up Hugh Allen & suggested lunch. My dear Sir Hughâ€”my dear Ethelâ€”there are facts you dont know about your sex. Believe me I have to go on coming to London, bullying, badgeringâ€”at last, they promise me 14 women in the orchestra. I go & find 2. So I begin ringing up.â€ She has a vein, like a large worm, in her temple which swells. Her cheeks redden. Her faded eyes flash. She has a broad rounded forehead. She recurred to dress. I have to go to Bath to hear dear Maurice Baringâ€™s little plays; & then we go to (here Elly interrupted) Rottingdean. And I must take an evening suit. Thats what worries me. Iâ€™m only happy in thisâ€”I have one gown I wear for conducting. And then I have to pack (here is a pineapple from Leonardâ€™s mother who waits outside). â€œMy maid? But sheâ€™s only a generalâ€”an Irish woman. â€œDr (she calls me Dr) Mrs Woolf doesnâ€™t mean to see you. Heres another letter from herâ€”to put you off.â€ But Iâ€™ve come. And dont it show that my appetite for life is still great? Iâ€™ve thought of nothing but seeing you for 10 days. And this friendship has come to me now.â€ So sincere & abrupt is she, & discriminating withalâ€”judging Vita & her secondrate women friends shrewdlyâ€”that perhaps something gritty & not the usual expansive fluff, may come of it. I like to hear her talk of music. She has written a pieceâ€”on Brewsterâ€™s Prisoner; & will have the gorgeous fun of orchestrating it this summer. She says writing music is like writing novels. One thinks of the seaâ€”naturally one gets a phrase for it. Orchestration is colouring. And one has to be very careful with oneâ€™s â€˜techniqueâ€™. Rhapsodises about A Room; about Miss Williamson; about the end of some book of Maurice Baringâ€™s. â€œIâ€™m in the street. I belong to the crowd. I say the crowd is right.â€ Perhaps she is right to belong to the crowd. There is something fine & tried & experienced about her besides the rant & the riot & the egotismâ€”& Iâ€™m not sure that she is the egotist that people make out. She said she never had anybody to admire her, & therefore might write good music to the end. Has to live in the country because of her passion for games. Plays golf, rides a bicycle; was thrown hunting two years ago. Then fell on her arm & was in despair, because life wd. be over if she could not play games. â€˜I am very strongâ€™ which she proved by talking till 7.30; then eating a biscuit & drinking a glass of vermouth & going off to eat a supper of maccaroni when she got to Woking at 9.

â€œIâ€™ll tell you all about itâ€ she grinned at her maid, who asked if I was a nice woman. A fine old creature, certainly, Ethel. She talks French â€˜meringuesâ€™ with a highly French accent.
