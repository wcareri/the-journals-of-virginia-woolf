### Saturday 20 December

W.Â H.Â D. Douglas drowned: six English lost: New motor regulation. Lord Willingdon appointed Viceroy of India.

And Kingsley Martin lunched with us (sweeping up turkey as a char sweeps feathers) & said that the Nation & the N.S. are to amalgamate; & he is to be editor (highly secret, like all nonsense) & would L. be literary editor? No; L. wd. not.
