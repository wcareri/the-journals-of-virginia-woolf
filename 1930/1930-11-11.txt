### Tuesday 11 November

Now what will happen next, when The Waves is done? I think some book of criticism; (Mrs Stiles to take away wastepaper) But I am dissatisfied with my own smart endings. I must get on to a peak & survey the question. These are our stages.

I thought, to give this book continuity, I would copy every day the headlines in the paper. But I cant remember them.

Mr Scullin & Labour. Armistice day celebrations. The Blazing Car murder. Prince of Walesâ€™s next Expedition.â€”at a shot.

William Plomer is back. Nessa returns, wifely ready to read or sit with Clive, on Thursday. Roger too. And I cry O Solitudeâ€”& look towards Rodmell. And the weather goes on blue & balmy. And I go to the dentist, & so does Leonard. And Rivett is a nervous but clean cook. And Nelly has appealed to Dr McGlashan. And we await development.

The other night, sitting on the floor by my side, Vita suffered considerably from jealousy of Ethel. She praised her, stoutly, but bitterly. She has all the abandonment that I, living in this age of subtlety & reserve, have lost. She claims you; rushes in where I force myself to hold back. When Hugh was here he said casually that he had met Ethel at tea. Such agony went through her she could not speak. And I noticed nothing; & in my usual blind way, made my usual mocking joke. This V. took seriously & brought out my letter for me to read.
