### Monday 29 December

One of my trial runs to exercise my hands. (Still in bed). Skinner was bred to the Bar, but became, unfortunately, a clergyman. Unfortunately too his wife died, of consumption, leaving him with 3 children. Of these the only satisfactory one was Laura, who inherited her fatherâ€™s love of collecting & tabulating, but also her motherâ€™s consumption, so that before she had collected, in a very orderly way, many cabinets of shells, she died; & the other children were unsatisfactory.

Skinner was rector of Camerton in Somerset, & there he remained, year after year, without any aptitude whatsoever for the souls of the living. A clever, upright conscientious man, he did his duty by his flock, by perpetually admonishing them. That they were always bad, seems strange, but was to him true. A colliery was being formed at the village. The morals of colliers are perhaps loose. At any rate, no village in England seems to have contained so many insolent, wicked, ungrateful villagers. And Skinner was forever comparing them with the Romans. His only comfort was to dream himself back into Camelodunum, & to forget 1828. But being a disciplinarian, he was tormented by the need for reproving the living. His conscience refused to let him shut his eyes upon the sufferings of the halfwitted Mrs Goold, or the iniquities practised upon imbecile paupers at the workhouse, & he must perpetually go his rounds among the sick & dying, for accidents among the miners were frequent. He was always on the side of the afflicted; never on the side of the happy. He considered himself one of the worst treated of men, & imagined malignancies & insolences on all sides. Mrs Jarrett, the Squiress, was an arch-hypocrite. All her kindness had deceit behind it. Then he was sometimes asked to a ballâ€”to a dinner party with French dishes. He much preferred solitude to the most brilliant society. Perpetually censorious, he found fault with French dishes, with dressing up, with all enjoymentâ€”save only that of writing & writing, long accounts of places, catalogues of antiquity, & in special, his great work upon Etymology. He met with only ridicule here too. At a parsons dinner, he was asked to explain, on his system, the name of Bumstead, which he didâ€”& then suspected that it was all a joke against him. Suspicion always came after a moments pleasure. Perhaps the only unalloyed pleasure was found in his visits to Stourhead, the seat of, where a party of antiquaries stayed for a day or two, giving themselves up to questions of Romans & Britons, of camps & buried cities. There, sitting alone in the luxurious library, he enjoyed the exquisite pleasure of copying extracts fromâ€”shall we say?â€”Ptolemy Theophrastus; & the good Bishop of Bath & Wells made him happy too in spite of a few suspicionsâ€”by asking him to spend the week end at Wells. These however were his only alleviations. Home life at Camerton became more & more sordid, humiliating, comfortless & by degrees violent. Jeered at & insulted by the rude peasants & farmers, who told him to his face that he was mad, his treatment was no better in his own vicarage, & from his own flesh & blood. There were terrible scenes with his sons. Once Joseph told him that he was making himself ridiculous by his writings, & was insane. Attempts to keep his son from drinking cider endedâ€”so irritating was his mannerâ€”in violent curses. The sons were always being sent to stay with their grandmother at Bath. It was his temper that was at fault, he said; but they were at fault to irritate his temper. The servants left, because he wd. not let them walk out after dinner. The farmers cursed him because he suspected them of stealing his tythes; he nervously, irritatingly & imcompetently tried to exact his due of lambs & haycocks, He knew nothing of farming, nothing of country life. All he knew was that Camerton had been Camelodunum, & his obsession on this point made even the good natured Baronet protest that he carried Camelodunum too far. So at lastâ€”all he could do was to write & write & write. The blank pages of his diary alone neither sneered, nor hawked in his face, nor mocked him behind his back, nor plotted his downfall, nor called him mad. Eighty four volumes of antiquarian lumber & daily complaint & journalising were scribbled & put away in certain great iron chests which were bequeathed to the British Museum. At last his confidant was the futureâ€”in 50 years after his death, he said, these 84 volumes were to be given to the worldâ€”which world would understand his great contribution to etymology, & take his side against the Churchwarden, Mrs Jarrett, Owen, the servant girl & all the rest of his ungrateful perpetually afflicting tribe. Fame & comfort would then be his. No doubt this secret confidence kept him going, through the gathering miseries of life. For the unhappy man was not blind to his faults. His chief misery must have come from the struggle of love & irritation. He loved his sonsâ€”yet drove them away. They fell ill, & he became all kindness & considerationâ€”& yet how could the unfortunate Owen endure to have his father with him?â€”his egotistic, exacting, morose, but devoted father? He gave pain even by his affection. And suddenly the diary, written in a crabbed & illegible hand, ceases to be copied out any longer. The brother whose task it was died.

Skinner went on writing, but nobody could read his script. Perhaps the knowledge that even this confidant had failed him finally decided him. At any rate, 7 years later, he went out one December morning in the beechwoods, & fired. They found his dead body & buried itâ€”exacerbated, scarred, covered with infernal irritationâ€”in the grave of his wife & Laura.

Now this little narrative being run off,â€”& Lord, how difficult to write in bedâ€”I report that the machine is not seriously damaged; & if I can get out, & move about, & yet not get a headache, I daresay in 3 days I shall be beginning to play gently with the waves. I dont have the temptations here of London. Not normal, but being normal is I daresay rather a fetish. All Mrs Dalloway was written with a temp, of 99 I think. How difficult though to get back into the right mental state: what a queer balance is needed. This little Skinner sketch is in the wrong order; but I dont fumble for words. Could let my mind fly, am not as I prove now, used up by an hourâ€™s exercise.

It rains. Nessa is driving from Seend today. Vita broadcasting. That bedroom voice, singing Bach, talking of the weather, has come in handy.
