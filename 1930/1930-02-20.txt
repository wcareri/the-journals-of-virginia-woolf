### Thursday 20 February

Feb. 20th, I must canter my wits if I can. Perhaps some character sketches.

Snow:

She came in wrapped in a dark fur coat; which being taken off, she appeared in nondescript grey stockinette & jay blue stripes. Her eyes too are jay blue, but have an anguished starved look, as of a cat that has climbed on to a chimney piece & looks down at a dog. Her face is pale, & very small; indeed, has a curious preserved innocency which makes it hard to think that she is 50. However, her neck is very loose skinned; & there are the dewlaps of middle age. The preserved look seems to indicate lack of experience; as if life had put her in a refrigerator. And we talkedâ€”She brought me a parcel, & this was a book from Ethel Smyth, with a letter, which to veil the embarrassment which I supposed her to feel, I read aloud. Her comment was â€œWhat miles away all this is from Cheltenham!â€ Then we talkedâ€”but it was her starved & anguished look that remains & the attitude of mind. She seemed to be saying inwardly â€œI have missed everything. There are Vanessa & Virginia, They have lives full of novels & husbands & exhibitions. I am fifty & it has all slipped by.â€ I gathered this from the jocose pertinacity with which she kept referring to herself. She said the climate of Cheltenham is so sleepy that she often cant paint; & after lunch they put on the gramophone; & then she goes most days to her mother at Bockhampton, where she likes meeting the village people. Farmers wives shake hands. After her mothers deathâ€”but she is only 80 & as firm as a rockâ€”she & Lily who is political, but of course that doesnâ€™t take up all her time exactly, are going to live at Harrogate, where the climate is not so sleepy, & they know more people. Nothing long distracted her from her central concernâ€”I have had no life & life is over. Even clothes suggested the same old theme. A dressmaker had told her that one enjoyed life more if one was well dressed. So she was trying this specific, to the tune of Â£8.8 at Pomeroyâ€™s in Old Burlington Street. But this worried & fretted her too. In fact I have seldom got a more dismal impression of sufferingâ€”too ignoble & petty to be called suffering: call it rather frustration, non-entity; being lifted on a shelf, & seeing things pass; â€œbut then I am very lazyâ€”thats what it isâ€”I lapse into comfort.â€ I should call it lapsing into despair. â€œWhat can three women do alone in the country?â€ Lord, how I praise God that I had a bent strong enough to coerce every minute of my life since I was born! This fiddling & drifting & not impressing oneself upon anythingâ€”this always refraining & fingering & cutting things up into little jokes & facetiousnessâ€”thats whats so annihilating. Yet given little money, little looks, no special gift, but only enough to make her devastatingly aware that other people have more gift, so that she sees her still lives against the superior still lives of Margaret Gere & the Cotswold school,â€”what can one do? How could one battle? How could one leap on the back of life & wring its scruff? One would joke, bitterly; & become egotistical & anxious to explain & excuse; & plaintive. What I thought most pathetic was the fact that about 5.30 she began to fidget (she never does anything boldly & directly) with her gloves, & say she must be going. But where? I asked. To the Polytechnic to hear a lecture upon French literature. But why? â€œOh one never hears French talked in Cheltenham.â€ Dear dear, but I could tell you all about French literature, I said. However, she shillied shallied; & whether she wanted to go or to stay, I donâ€™t know. And when I asked her what she was going to do that night, Well that depends how long the lecture lasts, she said, feebly laughing. Wont you go to a play? No I think I shall have what is called a snack at the Temperance hotel;â€”Lord Lord, I repeat again. And it isnâ€™t as if she were unconscious & oblivious: no, she knows that the dog is there, & arches her back & puts out her paw, but ever so feebly & fussily.
