### Friday 29 April

The difficulty is that I get so absorbed in this fantastic Pointz Hall I cant attend to Roger. So what am I to do? This however is only my first day of freedom; & I have been rendered self-conscious by a notice of T.G. on the front page of the new bloated TLS. Well it cant be helped; & I must cling to my â€˜freedomâ€™â€”that mysterious hand that was reached out to me about 4 years ago.

Meanwhile, Lady Simon came to tea, & of course looks forward to my castigation at their expenseâ€”for so I suspect it will be; a very nice salt of the earth dowdy but decisive woman, with whom Iâ€™m on impersonal good terms. Yet she alluded yesterday to my daughter, the most gifted of my children who died. And off she went in chocolate brown fur & puce to investigate elementary schools in Suffolk.

A fine day for once. Dog loose in square. L. & I have our weekâ€™s treat this afternoon. Iâ€™m in a dazed state, hovering between 2 worlds like a spiders web with nothing to attach the string to. Why not write about Scottâ€™s diaries, so bring in the immortal novels? My Times obit, on Ott. printed in early editions, omitted by mistake, they say, from the later. A thousand from H.B.: the last fruit I suppose from The Years. This makes about 3,000 from them. Can I therefore buy a chair? & 2 dresses? Oh how odd to see the blue sky at the top of the skylight again!
