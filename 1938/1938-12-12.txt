### Monday 12 December

Rather a debauched Sunday evening at Cliveâ€™s last night. Was he drunk? He was so quarrelsome & peevish, after dinner. A long tirade against motorists. Suddenly Nessa got quite red & said â€œThis conversation is so foolish weâ€™d better change itâ€. But Clive wdnâ€™t change it. Every change had its head snapped off. David Cecil derided; Lyttonâ€™s books dismissed. I thought of Roger & Lytton & how we used to talk of a Sunday evening. Now all personal gossip & these tedious bickerings.

L. lacerated with his rash. Injections only painful & do no good. He limped round St James Park. Very gloomy today. Fine weatherâ€”thats all that can be said in favour of the world & my grind at R. joyless & unprogressive. 2 days rewriting the transition page after 1918.
