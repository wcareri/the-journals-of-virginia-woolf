### Tuesday 20 September

Since Iâ€™m too stale to workâ€”rather headachyâ€”I may as well write a sketch roughly of the next chapter. (Iâ€™ve been rather absorbed in P.H. hence headache. Note: fiction is far more a strain than biographyâ€”thats the excitement.)

Suppose I make a break after Hâ elenâ€™s death (madness). A separate paragraph quoting what R. himself said. Then a break. Then begin definitely with the first meeting. That is the first impression: a man of the world not professor or Bohemian. Then give facts in his letters to his mother. Then back to the second meeting.

Pictures. Talk, about art. I look out of window. His persuasivenessâ€”a certain densityâ€”wished to persuade you to like what he liked. Eagernessâ€”absorptionâ€”stirâ€”a kind of vibration like a hawkmoth round him. Or shall I make a scene hereâ€”at Otts?

Then Câ onstantinoâ ple. Driving outâ€”getting things inâ€”his deftness in combining. Then quote the letters to R.  
The first 1910 show.  
The ridicule. Quote Wâ ilfred Blunt.  
Effect on R. Another close up.  
The letter to MacColl. His own personal liberation. Excitement. Found his method (but this wasnâ€™t lasting, his letters to Vâ anessa show that he was swayed too much by her.)  
Love. How to say that he now was in love?  
Give the pre-war atmosphere. Ott. Duncan. France. Letter to Bridges about beauty & sensuality. His exactingness. Logic.
