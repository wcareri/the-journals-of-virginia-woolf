### Thursday 3 February

Tomorrow is Julianâ€™s birthday: his 30th I suppose. And Iâ€™ve been reading what Charles has to say of him. Nobleness his sign mark: & naturalness. Thats true too. A complete lack of self-consciousness; a directness won for him by our flounderings; & yet when he had gained the open world he had to make his choice. Had to be killed in Spainâ€”an odd comment upon his education & our teaching. I dont think Charles, who has many very precise bees in his bonnet, quite sees to the bottom of the crisis, but then my visionâ€”how Julian wanted a professionâ€”his innate desire for self assertion, to be a figure, perhaps thats tinged by some obfuscation of my own.

Judith brought a Leslie Humphries to tea the other dayâ€”I still in my dressing gown after my first walk. A very nice couple. Theyâ€™re free too; but more balance to them, I rather think. Anyhow I spurted my ideas for a new society at Newnham to Judith; who at once enlarged them to consist of dinners in private rooms with a subject for discussionâ€”say Hazlitt, for whom she has a passion. This is putting flesh & blood on the ideas in 3 Gs. a work wh. L. is now reading.

One always has to allow for the extreme diminution of force: the effect on a second person is so much slighter than one expected. My satire seems to him mild. But the final verdict has not yet been given. I have now to do the notes. A love letter from Philip: the Press business practically through: John our partner: his first interview with Miss Lange yesterday: the Cecils today; Nessa afterwards; Monks House; still fine day.
