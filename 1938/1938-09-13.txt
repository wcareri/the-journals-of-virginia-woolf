### Tuesday 13 September

No war yet anyhow. Hitler boasted & boomed but shot no solid bolt. Mere violent rant, & then broke off. We listened in to the end. A savage howl like a person excruciated; then howls from the audience; then a more spaced & measured sentence. Then another bark. Cheering ruled by a stick. Frightening to think of the faces. & the voice was frightening. But as it went on we said (only picking a word or two) anti-climax. This seems to be the general verdict. He darent cross the line. Comes up to it & stands bawling insults. Times very scathing & sarcastic. How can people stand this nonsense? Negotiations to go on, under threat that he will use force if &c.

Immense relief last night at Monkâ€™s House, after a gloomy dinner. Very hot. Jaded with Brighton. Lunch with Wm & Morgan at a place where he knew the waitress. I depressed by praise of Morganâ€™s Credo: silence on all my friends part about my own. But the impersonal attitude worked well. I let myself sink like a bag from a balloon: & felt, if dejected, light & free. A good piece of work that, for it leaves me free to go on my way in silence. Not from journalists or schoolmasters though. A great packet of reviews from USA. All summer in a day again. Oh we enjoy being alone, save that Iâ€™m too jaded to do Roger. Wicks here about the tiles. John tomorrow. London & farewell to Charleston on Thursday. Peaceful if depressed: anyhow a week or 2 without war.

Odd this new public anxiety: how it compares with private: how it blinds: but too stupid to write. And lunch waiting this roasting hot morning.
