### Wednesday 14 September

Things worse today. Rioting in Prague. Sudeten ultimatum. It looks as if Hitler meant to slide sideways into war. Raises riots: will say cant be stopped. This came on the 9.30 wireless last night. This morning more marking time. No one knows. Headachy, partly screw of Roger: partly this gloom. So Iâ€™m stopping Roger; as we go up to lunch with Bella tomorrow. And whats the private position? So black I cant gather together. Work I suppose. If it is war, then every country joins in: chaos. To oppose this with Roger my only private position. Well thats an absurd little match to strike. But its a hopeless war thisâ€”when we know winning means nothing. So weâ€™re committed, for the rest of our lives, to public misery. This will be slashed with private too. Quentin: all the young married people. Ann &c. Weâ€”L. & Iâ€”can make out I suppose down here: vegetables & fruit. And Iâ€™ve made some money. Neednâ€™t cringe. Thats about all. I feel I said what I wanted in 3 Gs. & am not to care if its 1: made my own friends hostile; laid me open to abuse & ridicule; also praise where I dont want it; & paying bills for Wms. Societies: Â£3.9 for a ridiculous leafletâ€”Thats my debt to civilisation. Then suppose John called up! The Press? But all wallows & wavers in complete chaos. Odd that this should be a stimulus to the complete artist. One will have to sit at home & write. I suppose air raids may toss a bomb through the skylight. Growls go on overhead. Louie says the carpenter is on the reserve. They chaff him as heâ€™s a socialist. 1914 but without even the illusion of 1914. All slipping consciously into a pit.

But John lunches. Q. & A. to tea. Dine tomorrow at Charleston. Fine summer day.
