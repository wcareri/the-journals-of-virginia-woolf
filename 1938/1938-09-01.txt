### Thursday 1 September

A very fine clear September day. Sybil threatens to dine, but may put us offâ€”should a Cabinet Minister crop up. Politics marking time. A violent attack on 3 Gs in Scrutiny by Q. Leavis. I dont think it gave me an entire single thrill of horror. And I didnt read it through. A symbol though of what wiggings are to come. But I read enoâ€™ to see that it was all personalâ€”about Queenieâ€™s own grievances & retorts to my snubs. Why I dont care more for praise or wigging I dont know. Yet its true. A slight distaste for my biog. of Roger this morning: too detailed & flat. But I must take it up tomorrow, & lay aside P.H. I fear. Quentin over to finish his table. We have settled to keep the roof Cornish cream colour. I found a new walk down Telscombe valley to the river yesterday.

Oh Queenie was at once cancelled by a letter from Jane Walkerâ€”a thousand thanks â€¦ 3 Gs ought to be in the hands of every English speaking man & woman &c.
