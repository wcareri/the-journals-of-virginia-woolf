### Friday 30 September

L. has just come in, it being 11.15. to say that he overheard a Broadcast when he was in the W.C.: dashed out: turned on our wireless; & heard that terms are being made at Munich. I cant go into them. But it means peace. That was the upshot of the stop press in The Times this morning. They are agreeing to let some Germans into C.S. today: then English Italian & French are to enter & guarantee: then a 3 months pause. Three months in which to settle the question, instead of bombs on London & Paris today! Well, Chamberlain must be looking on the bright sunshine this morning with a good deal of relief. He went off yesterday quoting Hotspur â€œOut of this nettle danger we pluck the flower safetyâ€â€”words that Katherine Mansfield has on her tomb. Such a reversal was never known: save that there was always a huger nightmare unreality that clouded all distinct feeling. Iâ€™m doing Roger & PIP & must break off this historical note to go back to that.

Harold kept in London caballing with Winston & Eden to keep the PM from giving away too much. Certainty of peace not quite certain yesterday; but the 9,000 children who were to have come to Sussex held up. The obvious feeling everywhere was We dont want this war. No glorification, as Mrs Dean remarked: the mouthpiece of the nation, as much as Chamberlain. Oh & the K. of Italy is said to have stiffened Musso: who stiffened Châ amberlain, & thus weakened Hitler, by threatening abdication. So Vita reported from Harold.

I will continue, as I have 10 minutes before lunch: continue that is to try & describe the reversal; which is soberly & truly life after death. For we, even if we escaped, should have had our noses rubbed in death; ruin; perhaps the end finally of all order, so L. admitted was his background. It would have meant our last 15 years of life spent in battling for a thread of liberty; keeping the Press going among the deaths of the young. And now suddenly we can travel & move & use our normal faculties. No slaughter of the young beneath us. I wonder if we could have faced it even hereâ€”entertaining East end children in the hall; writing; getting all the dismal fag ends of things thrown us; & reading Casualty Lists. Now of course one makes not new resolutions, but attacks the old with some fervour. They seem to have blood in them. I wonder how far we cd. really get a move on; make a difference, if we tried? Possiblyâ€”sanguinelyâ€”a new view will dominate. Hitler will sink instead of swell. But what a shave! Northease Barn already turned into a hospital; Gwenâ€™s daughter â€œevacuatedâ€ to school at Stanmer Park; 60 children laid on mattresses in the gallery; marvels of organisation recited on the BBC last night. All who wish to leave London to go to certain tube stations, with a thick coat & enough food for the day: children to bring no glass bottles: parents not to come. Public will then be taken free of charge to towns & villages 50 miles out of London. Each will be given a stamped card on wh. to write to friends. No choice of destination. &c. Eddy Sackville volunteered to drive an ambulance in London. Food all arranged for. The net result is that we are presented with 2 gas masks by the Govt: & have bought 4 candlesticks at Woolworths, & ordered an extra supply of coals.

A very fine day.
