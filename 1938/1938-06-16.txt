### Thursday 16 June

Baldock. Stop to light a pipe on the Icknield Way, a scrubby street of yellow villas. Now St James Deeping. After Croyland, a magnificent moulded Church. Now very hot; flat; an old gent fishing. Spread out and exposed. River above road level. On now to Gainsborough. Lunch at Peterborough: factory chimneys. Railway gate opened; off again. Gainsborough. A red Venetian palace rising among bungalows; in a square of unkempt grass. Long windows, leaning walls. A maze of little lanes. A strange forgotten town.
