### Thursday 15 December

This is hells Black Calcutta hole week.

Monday Angelica. Tuesday Rose. Wednesday lunch Vita to meet Stark: after dinner to Williamâ€™s to meet von Schuberts; Freud & E. Williamson to dine tonight. Tomorrow E. Bowen & Robson: Calâ edonian Market: Ethel Smyth; Saturday Robsons: Sunday Tomâ€”& why? But I have invented a very good scheme: putting weight on enjoyment not duty. I think it works. I am going to make out a private budget for the New Year. Clothes; presents; &c: & see if this will give me more 20 money to spend lawfully on myself. Last year I gave away Â£20 to Nessa; Â£8 for her chair; Â£100 to Angelica; bought D.â€™s picture Â£30: Q.â€™s table 5: tiles Â£10: mirror Â£15. lent H. 150. Sophie Â£10. That (roughly counted) makes Â£348 given or lent, with a philanthropic element; as in the art objects. This I must control. I must continue A.â€™s 100 & Sophieâ€™s Â£10. but draw in the other miscellaneous givings. No verbal commissions any more. But how much on dress & pocket money & house furnishing? Charity? And I will forecast my income. Hâ arperâ€™s Bâ azaar (London) â€œlikesâ€ Lâ appin and Lâ apinova, but wont commit themselves till they hear from Davis. I suspect they wont take it.
