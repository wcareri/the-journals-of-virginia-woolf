A ten minutes spin here. L. gravely approves 3 Gs. Thinks it an extremely clear analysis. On the whole Iâ€™m content. One cant expect emotion, for as he says, its not on a par with the novels. Yet I think it may have more practical value. But Iâ€™m much more indifferent, thats true: feel it a good piece of donkeywork, & dont think it affects me either way as the novels do.

David Cecil to teaâ€”a thin slip of a man: like the stalk of a bluebell. Said he begins, at 36, to feel stale. Therefore accepts Clark lectureship, on Hardy, & would like a Provostry at Wadham. A dried analytic mind. Not much room or verge in him. No juice: interesting as a type; & until Nessa & Leonard came in & were judicialâ€”she very set & almost sternâ€”I enjoyed my intimacy. Again, what is Desmond, why is he, whom all our swains adore, so melancholic & superficial? The faÃ§ade. Could he have broken it, would he have written better? Old questions. Now to Rodmell
