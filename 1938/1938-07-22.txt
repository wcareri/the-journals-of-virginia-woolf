### Friday 22 July

If I were not rather proud of my abstracting power, how could I keep my head now, called on to write Roger aÂ m: to interview Origo, Simon &c. about 3 Gs. 5 to 7.: to combat John & the young generation this evening; to sympathise with Adrian, see Bussys, Rothensteins; give tea to Virginia Richards aged 8; & have Elizabeth Bowen, &c skirmishing in & out? Nor do I suspect that Rodmell will be a shelter. Mary threatens to come & stay. So I must exercise my new muscles; be adept at making compartments; filling them, like a pipe, full but not too full. Iâ€™m getting more adept at leaping from swing to swing this summer, better than last anyhow. Its odd how oneâ€™s friends torment one. Oh & Richard Hughes duns me for a written opinion on his book. Also theres Vita & her poem. And I have written to say that she must withdraw her charges.

Weather steamy but no longer blue. Sat in Gordon Sqre last night & D. & V. were we thought unreasonable about R. & W. Rn. & the Grafton. What a kettle of fish! And 3 Gs. is once more selling: has now broached the 6 thousand. But my new clock says itâ€™s 2 mins. to one. The man came, like a doctor, to regulate. Ann was married yesterday. I gave her Â£15; L. Â£10. Thats all Iâ€™ve time for.
