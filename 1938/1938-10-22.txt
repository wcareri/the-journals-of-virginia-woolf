### Saturday 22 October

Decidedly less jangled; though my promise to pay H.â€™s overdraught still remains: she has not sent me any word thoâ€™, & thus cowardlike I hope I may keep my hoard intact. Yet Iâ€™m glad not to have to buy expensive clothes. An odd little kink in my mind, which I cant untwist. I daresay this will make interesting reading to me one of these days, should I write a true memoir. Anyhow, it did slightly bear fruit when Colefax came to see me yesterday. I said I will only dine with you if I may walk. Dressing & driving in a cab destroy my sentenceâ€”jerk me fr one consciousness to another. Iâ€™ll dine with you to meet the D. of Devonshire as I am. Now this was logical & sensible: making the best of modern conditions as R. has it. She asserts that her ambition is to preserve civilisation. So is my ambition. It boils down to dining with Sâ . in day clothes. Also to bring Isherwood & Auden to dine there. That I dont promise: but why not explore this possibility of seeing the great world from a new angle? I think it fits in with my general scheme at present. Then I can pay Helen: keep my self respect &c. And weâ€™re lunching early to go to Hampton Court, after a long grindâ€”not quite fruitlessâ€”at R.â€”the Broussa scene. Iâ€™m interested, though the drudgery is intenseâ€”quotes & general outline. But I see it: its the doing the detail in words thats the worry.
