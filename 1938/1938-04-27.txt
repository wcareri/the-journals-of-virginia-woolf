Ottolineâ€™s burial service. Oh dear, oh dear the lack of intensity; the wailing & mumbling, the fumbling with bags; the shuffling; the vast brown mass of respectable old South Kensington ladies. And then the hymns; & the clergyman with a bar of medals across his surplice; & the orange & blue windows; & a toy Union Jack sticking from a cranny. What all this had to do with Ottoline, or our feelings? Save that the address was to the point: a critical study, written presumably by Philip & delivered, very resonantly, by Mr Speiaght the actor: a sober, & secular speech, which made one at least think of a human being, though the reference to her beautiful voice caused one to think of that queer nasal moan: however that too was to the good in deflating immensities. P.â€™s secretary buttonholed me, & told me to sit high up. The pew was blocked by a vast furred lady who said â€œIâ€™m afraid I cant moveâ€â€”as indeed seemed the fact. So, I stationed myself rather behind; near enoâ€™ though to see the very well set up back of P. in his thick coat; & his red Rams head turned now & then looking along the ranks: also I pressed his hand, simulated I fear, more emotion than I felt when he asked me, had I liked the address? & so slowly moved out on to the stepsâ€”past Jack & Mary, Sturge Moores, Molly, &c: Gertler having tears in his eyes; various household staffs; was then pounced on & pinioned by Lady Oxford: who was hard as whipcord; upright; a little vacant in the eye, in spite of make up which made it shine. She said she had expostulated with Ott. about the voice. Mere affectation. But a wonderful woman. Tell me, though, why did her friends quarrel with her? Pauseâ€”She was exigeante, Duncan volunteered at last. And so Margot refused to ask further; & modulated into stories of Symonds & Jowett, when I bantered her on her obituary. Mine, of Ott. for the Times, has not appeared nor do I much regret. So to Nessaâ€™s where we recounted the story; & yet Iâ€™m left fumbling for a house I shant go to. Odd how the sense of loss takes this quite private form: someone who wont read what I write. No illumination in Gower Street, an intimacy checked abolished.
