### Monday 9 May

This is written to fill up the usual distracted relics of Mondays broken morning: drove up in the clear May morning light: sun out wonderously; laburnum all chipped by the bitter spring: but pink on the may, & various fine shades of gold red & bluebell blue on the trees all the same. Found here that Richard cant dine & go to A.â€™s play this evening (she had a triumph, dancing, Nessa says; is mentioned in the Times): also Miss Phyllis Bentleyâ€™s lecture on me; shall I tell her anything true about The Years for example? Then Tom in Portugal; then Mary Hutch, whom I met in a shoe shop; then Morgan asking some literary help about a quotation in a pageant. Then I ring up Sally & mercifully secure her for tonight: find Mabel has moved the drawing room chair hereâ€”oh what comfort I now sit in after 10 years moderate discomfort; but her chair, her long promised chair, has stuck. A rather patchy week end: bitter cold, Q. didnt come; I had no good nonsense book; & giddy in the head; cant settle either to my Play (Pointz Hall is to become in the end a play) or to Rogerâ€™s Cambridge letters. The truth is we want a holiday; & have to dribble along rather jaded, trying odds & ends to keep moving, until June 8th or so, when we escape. However on Sunday, we walked, rather slowly to save my head, from Tarring Neville toward Bishopstone, along the long Down road made by primeval carts; & half the down was blue purple with some grass: & then the gorse blazing silky, nutty, hares racing; home to bowls & the silly clever imitation & oh how she makes me detest my own writingâ€”May Sartonâ€™s book this refers to, ungrammatically. A social week ahead: Bella back; lunch Clive; to Philip to choose a ring & emotionalise; 2 plays of Aâ ngelicaâ€™â s & God damn it, Saturday at Rayâ€™s. L. rather on edge about that. Now lunch.
