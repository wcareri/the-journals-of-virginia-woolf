### Friday 25 November

L.â€™s birthdayâ€”58? But I open this, to note, at the foot of the last pessimistic page, in 2 minutes, the fact that pessimism can be routed by getting into the flow: creative writing. A passage in Bioâ graphy. came right. After an incredible empty churning & grinding. Cold tears standing behind my eyes. It came right & Iâ€™m floated. So why not, when pessimistic, dandle the brain a little, until it gets into its circuit?

A fine cold day: L.â€™s birthday.
