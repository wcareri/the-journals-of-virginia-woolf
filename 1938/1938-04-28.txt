### Thursday 28 April

Walked in Dulwich yesterday & lost my brooch by way of a freshener when confronted with the final proofs just today (April 28th) done; & to be sent this afternoon: a book I shall never look at again. But I now feel entirely free. Why? Have committed myself, am afraid of nothing. Can do anything I like. No longer famous, no longer on a pedestal; no longer hawked in by societies: on my own, for ever. Thats my feeling: a sense of expansion, like putting on slippers. Why this shd. be so, why I feel myself enfranchised till death, & quit of all humbug, when I daresay its not a good book, & will excite nothing but mild sneers; & how very inconsequent & egotistical V.W. isâ€”why why I cant analyse: being fluttered this morning. Lady Simon this afternoonâ€”Well Iâ€™ve done my bit for that cause, & cant be bullied. And then, when they badger me, I can say Refer to 3 Gs.

Rain & dark. A lost dog in the Square; political lull. Income Tax up to 5/6. Our earnings prodigious. Income last year about Â£6,000. John much impressed. Press worth Â£10,000. & all this sprung from that type on the drawing room table at Hogarth House 20 years ago. I can now give all my mind to Roger; also blow a few private bubbles of a morning; & dont wait publication day with any expectations. I shall I feel forget this book completely. Yet I never wrote a book with greater fervour; under such a lash of compulsion. And it stood me in good stead. Now America wants Common Reader articles. (Penguin republishes in the autumn) will pay Â£50: & I think of Walt Whitman: Walpoleâ€™s Letters; & Whiteâ€™s Selborne. 3 Gs. has won me the right to go back to that world: no doubt a more â€˜realâ€™ world: but debarred by brambles for 4 years.
