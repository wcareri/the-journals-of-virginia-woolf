### Tuesday 1 November

Max like a Cheshire cat. Orbicular. Jowld. Blue eyed. Eyes grow vague. Something like Bruce Richmondâ€”all curves. What he said was, Ive never been in a group. No, not even as a young man. It was a serious fault. When youâ€™re a young man you ought to think Theres only one right way. And I thoughtâ€”this is very profound, but you maynt realise itâ€”â€œIt takes all sorts to make a world.â€ I was outside all the groups. Now dear Roger Fry who liked me, was a born leader. No one so â€œilluminatedâ€. He looked it. Never saw anyone look it so much. I heard him lecture, on the Aesthetics of Art. I was disappointed. He kept on turning the pageâ€”turning the pageâ€¦. Hampstead hasnt yet been spoilt. I stayed at Jack Strawâ€™s Castle some years ago. My wife had been having influenza. And the barmaid, looking over her shoulder saidâ€”my wife had had influenza twiceâ€”â€œQuite a greedy one arent you?â€ Now thats immortal. Thereâ€™s all the race of barmaids in that. I suppose Iâ€™ve been ten times into public houses. George Moore never used his eyes. He never knew what men & women think. He got it all out of books. Ah I was afraid you would remind me of Ave atque Vale. Yes. Thats beautiful. Yes, its true he used his eyes then. Otherwise its like a lovely lake, with no fish in it. The Brook Kerith â€¦

Coulson Kernahan? (I told how CK. stopped me in Hastings. Are you Edith Sitwell? No, Mrs W. And you? Coulson Kernahan.) At this Max gobbled. Instantly said he had known him in Yellow Book days. He wrote God & the Ant. Sold 12 million copies. And a book of reminiscencesâ€”How I visited Lord Roberts â€¦ The great man rose from his chair. His eyesâ€”were they hazel? were they blue? were they brown?â€”no they were just soldierâ€™s eyes â€¦ And he wrote, Celebrities I have not metâ€”Max Beerbohm. I gave him Ottolineâ€™s ring. â€œI only knew her superficiallyâ€”Was she happy. She quarrelledâ€”Eleanor (or whatever Mrs B.â€™s name is: she is drooping; washed out; loose lipped; sympathetic; one finger plastered) & Ottoline quarrelled. Your obituary was lovely. Did he indeed ring you up? Well, how strange people are. And they write, Lady Eglantyne â€¦ has raised the standard of heaven â€¦

About his own writing: dear Lytton Strachey said to me: first I write one sentence; then I write another. Thats how I write. And so I go on. But I have a feeling writing ought to be like running through a field. Thats your way. Now how do you go down to your room, after breakfastâ€”what do you feel? I used to look at the clock, & say Oh dear me, its time I began my articleâ€¦. No, Iâ€™ll read the paper first. I never wanted to write. But I used to come home from a dinner party & take my brush & draw caricature after caricature. They seemed to bubble up from here â€¦ he pressed his stomach. That was a kind of inspiration, I suppose. What you said in your beautiful essay about me & Charles Lamb was quite true. He was crazy, he had the gift â€¦ genius. Iâ€™m too like Jack Horner. I pull out my plum. Its too rounded, too perfect â€¦ I have a public of about 1500â€”Oh Iâ€™m famous, largely thanks to you, & people of importance at the top like you. I often read over my own work. And I have a habit of reading it through the eyes of people I respect. I often read it as Virginia Woolf would read itâ€”picking out the kind of things you would like. You never do that? Oh you should try it.

Willie Maugham came in: like a dead man whose beard or moustache has grown a little grisly bristle after death. And his lips are drawn back like a dead mans. He has small ferret eyes. A look of suffering & malignity & meanness & suspicion. A mechanical voice as if he had to raise a lever at each wordâ€”stiffens talk into something hard cut measured. Talked of Aldousâ€”his conversion. He thinks his soul & Gerald Heardâ€™s soul are one soul. Max said he had been taught by Leonard Huxley at Charterhouse. Poor fellow, so distinguished, so cultivated â€¦ they ragged him. And I could picture the interview with the headmaster. I am so glad that you are finding a larger scope for your abilitiesâ€”getting rid of him. And I could imagine this charming fellow, newly married to a delightful young lady &c &c. Willie M. never imagined in this way. Sat like an animal in a trap: or like a steel trap. And I could not say anything that loosed his dead manâ€™s jaw. He wanted searching analytical statement about Gerald Heardâ€™s character. GH has been very kind to me, he said, as if he needed kindness. But I want to know: do you think he hasâ€”I think he wanted to know if he were a genuine person; but I couldnâ€™t fit my mind to his. Then the Bâ eerbohms went; & MB reappeared, in a smart overcoat (he wore double breasted blue suit) carrying a black cane with a white billiard ball on top. â€œDo you see how careful I was to say Sybil? before I came in, to warn her, lest she might be saying, What an old bore Max has become!â€

Isherwood & I met on the doorstep. He is a slip of a wild boy: with quicksilver eyes. Nipped. Jockey like. That young man, said W. Maugham â€œholds the future of the English novel in his hands.â€ Very enthusiastic. In spite of Maxâ€™s brilliance, & idiosyncrasy, which he completely realises, & does not overstep, this was a surface evening: as I proved, because I found I could not smoke the cigar which I had brought. That was on the deeper level. All kept to the same surface level by Sybilâ€™s hostesscraft. Stories. Compliments. The house: its shell like whites & silvers & greens; its panelling; its old furniture. And Lord Ivor: & Lord de la Warr.

We are going to look at 6 Endsleigh St after lunch, a freehold house, costing Â£7,500.
