### Wednesday 27 July

Yesterday we had John to tea, & the Bussys to dinner, Chilvers in after dinner. Rather hard bilingual work. Simon praised W. Rothn. Inclined to laugh at Bâ loomsbury. He said they had never noticed his work. Dâ orothy said this. Clive & Roger ignored him. Thought Râ oger an illuminÃ©; his best work on CÃ©zanne. Threw things over. Marchand droppedâ€”put his hands outâ€”down on the ground. But very learned & charming. Is Matisse sincere? asked him meeting in the street, 1910.
