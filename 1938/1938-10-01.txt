### Saturday 1 October

A violent stormâ€”purple ink cloudsâ€”dissolving like blots of ink in waterâ€”strong enough to drive us in here in the middle of our game. L. is storing applesâ€”finest harvest for perhaps some years. No longer a matter of concern. We were to live on apples honey & cabbage. Postman delivered an orationâ€”â€œjust my own thoughtsâ€ on War & Dictators. How all will worship Câ hamberlain now: but in 5 years time we may be saying we ought to have put him, Hitler, down now. These dictators & their lust for powerâ€”they cant stop. Heâ€™ll get stronger & stronger. Then â€¦ But now we cant help being glad of peace. Its human nature. Weâ€™re made that way. A solid clear spoken if repetitive private thinker who kept our letters waiting 10 minutes. Only the N. Statesman &c. Soon looked through & tossed aside. Peace when they went to Press hung on a straw. Now grown (we suppose) to a ropeâ€”unless this storm is symbolical; its odd how susceptible the mind becomes to weather symbolsâ€”roping everything inâ€”in crises like this is, or was. Of course thereâ€™s bound to be a turn against reliefâ€”but Iâ€™m watching the stormâ€”as in violent illness. One turns peevish & has a sense of emptiness. I should fill this now either by letter writing or sketching R. wh last as the least burdensome, I will do.
