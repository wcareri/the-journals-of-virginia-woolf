### Wednesday 16 November

There are very few mountain summit moments. I mean, looking out at peace from a height. I made this reflection going upstairs. That is Iâ€™m â€œgoing upstairsâ€ now, when I write Biography. Shall I have a moment on top? Or when Iâ€™ve done Roger? or tonight, in bed, between 2 & 3? They come spasmodically. Often when I was so miserable about The Years.

Viola Tree died last night, of pleurisy: 2 years younger than I am.

I remember the quality of her skin: like an apricot; a few amber coloured hairs. Eyes blistered with paint underneath. A huge Goddess woman, who was also an old drudge; a big boned striding figure; much got up, of late. Last time I saw her at the Gargoyle Cocktail; when she was in her abundant expansive mood. I never reached any other; yet always liked her. Met her perhaps once a year, about her books. She dined here the night her Castles in Spain came out. And I went to tea in Woburn Sq. & the butter was wrapped in a newspaper. And there was an Italian double bed in the drawing room. She was instinctive; & had the charm of good actress manners; & their Bohemianism, & sentimentality. But I think was a sterling spontaneous mother & daughter; not ambitious; a great hand at life; I suppose harassed for money; & extravagant; & very bold; & courageousâ€”a maker of picturesque surroundings. So strong & large, that she shd. have lived to be 80: yet no doubt undermined that castle, with late hours; drink? I dont know. She could transmit something into words. Her daughter Virginia to be married this week. And think of Viola lying deadâ€”How out of placeâ€”unnecessary.

Dinner at Cliveâ€™s. Janice lashing out, like a bird that begins to flutter & peck. Wants to be off? Anyhow we all talked: about Jews: about Cliveâ€™s lunch party with Willy Maugham & de la Mare: which are the best books for the illiterate: then about being Jews: then about technique: the word broken in the Bible; L. read passages. A confused argument about technique; wh. Janice sided I dont know. Anyhow she spoke up. A symptom of revolt from the elderly? She left when we did. Clive looking down from his dining room window. He leaves Gordon Square in January.
