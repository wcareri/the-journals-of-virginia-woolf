### Tuesday 23 August

Its odd to be as nervous as I am at the idea of seeing Maynard tomorrow, & his heckling: dear old Hitler. But I wont be nervous; Iâ€™ll go & walk on the terrace for 10 minutes before lunch. The worst of this kind of controversy is that it adds so much friction to my work on Roger: I have to urge my mind on, while the surface is all worried & flurried into tufts & vapours of replies & arguments. So it kindles, like a meteor, & burns, instead of keeping cool & dark & solid as I had hoped this summer. The price I pay, though, for having views. Never mind. Now the terraceâ€”& a treat this afternoon.
