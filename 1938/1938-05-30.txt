### Monday 30 May

Nessaâ€™s birthdayâ€”the 58th I think it must be. She is at Charleston, with A. & Q. now that A.â€™s time at Islington is done. Oh dearâ€”Julian not there. And it rains hardâ€”she says she is glad to be away. How could she have lived through the suspense last summer? what tortureâ€”so I thought, as I walked to Gough Square yesterday, by way of freshener before the Robson children & Tom at tea. A great spread; mostly eaten. The little boy crammed his mouth with sweets, & added one that Sally had already sucked. Tom came, most respectable; swallow tails & grey silk tie, having he explained to slip into his evening service in time to take round the plateâ€”a churchwarden in South Kensington. Very friendly; & elaborate description of his triumphal progress through Portugal as Brit. Rep. on some prize giving commission. And then he spoke at Salisbury on George Herbert, in aid of the Cathedral, staying with the Richmonds. I was amused at the careful analysis he gave Julietteâ€”a very sympathetic Frogâ€”no humbugâ€”no clothesâ€”giving dinner to 30 people off cold food & so onâ€”of his own plays failure, & of Priestleyâ€™s artistic nonentity, scrupulously, painfully conscientious in detail; with his wild hazel eyes.

But I meant to record the chart: Observer has a friendly forecast: says 3 Gs. is poetic; profound; in my essayists vein; so that brings in another noteâ€”poetry, beautifully written & lucidly argued. No word from Pippa. L. says I must expect some very angry reviews from men. I add, From women too. Then thereâ€™ll be the clergy. But I think I can sit calm as a toad in an oak at the centre of the storm. And am training myself to inhabit that centreâ [;] read quietly: Walpole; Johnson; & stodge away at Roger. I possess my soulâ€”now thats a thing one can do. I am not forcing myself to buy a new dress from Murrayâ€”a great victory for the shabby city haunting V. Its trueâ€”people cant really â€œget at oneâ€.
