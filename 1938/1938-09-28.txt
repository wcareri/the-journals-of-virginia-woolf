### Wednesday 28 September

This may be the last day of peace; so why not record it, as Iâ€™ve 20 minutes & nothing to do? Why record it? But this â€œwhy?â€ has to be battened down. A tumultuous week endâ€”Judith, Noel & Virginia; Charleston: Clive Janice Raymond. Pouring wet Monday. L. came out to say Kingsley Martin begged him to come up, in order to act as liaison between the LP & the Liberals. He was the only person &c. So we decided to go at once & spend the night. Drove up in the rain. Men digging trenches at Turnham Green. London crowded. Dropped Judith. L. went to see K.M. I to buy coffee &c. â€œIts a miserable day & our thoughts are miserableâ€ the woman at de Bry said. She said we should win; & that it would not be a long war. â€œBut whats the point of winning?â€ I said, at which she exclaimed & shrugged her shoulders in agreement. Then KM to dinner; charcoal black round the eyes; as usual something histrionic. All about his article in the NS: had he been wrong? Weâ€™ve all been wrong. A desire to confess. But also very wretched. Hopelessly restless. Melodramatic in his gestures, swaying as he walked to the telephone; perpetually looking at the time & ringing people up. Got the BBC. â€œWell A.C. Whats Hitler said? Ah hahâ€”â€ Then Phil Baker. Do you agree with what I wrote? No word of any possible plan or reason for summoning L. Stayed on, drinking, smoking. Then said he was going to walk the streets. Couldnt sleep. Still thought it possible we should rat. Also Phil said Hitler would cry off. So to bed. Telephones all the morning. I went to the London Library. Sat in the basement & looked up The Times on PIP in 1910. Old sweeper gently dusting. Came & said, Theyre telling us to try on our masks. Have you got yours I asked. No not yet. And shall we have war? I fear so, but I still hope not. I live out in Putney. Oh theyve laid in sand bags; the books will be moved; but if a bomb strikes the houseâ€¦. May I dust under your chair? I looked in at the Nat Gall, being warned by a sober loud speaker to get my gas mask as I walked down Pall Mall. A man repeats this warning through a megaphone as he drives. A lecture being given by a red faced elderly man on Watteau & French painting. A largish crowd following. I looked at Renoir, Cezanne &c: tried to see through Rogerâ€™s eyes: tried to get some solidity into my mind. So to lunch. Question what to do about the Press. The girls sensible but of course apprehensive. Plans can only be sketched. Possibly John will transport the whole Press to Fieldhead. Nothing can be done till Saturday. House meets today. We arranged for Mabel to go to Bristol. We shall stay here, provisionally. I went to Lewis & bought folders.* We must settle into work at any rate. We must drive our pens & keep the Press going that way. Rain settled in. Miss Moir of the Forum arrived at 3.15â€”& John & Rosinsky for L. She was a painted battered professional journalist. Wants controversial articles: Â£20 only: but can say what I like, I gave her vermouth. Stayed talking. Sister of a Suffolk clergyman. The Govt, is evacuating the East End to Suffolk. All cottages prepared to billet.

So it goes on. We had a rather unpleasant farewell with the Pressâ€”they staying, we going. Its reasonable of course. But one doesnt like leaving them there: & yet they want to stay, for the money. We may have to pay them, or let them go, & try to keep on paying. But as L. & I say, we cant now decide, or think. A violent rain storm; a great crowd in the streets. The worstâ€”longest drive in half lights under trees, rain splashed; & so late that we only got here at 8.15. Poor Louie missed the PMâ€™s broadcast. He said nothingâ€”except that we cd not fight for the small C.S. matter onlyâ€”a possible hint. But weâ€™ve given up stressing the importance of hints. Hitler seems as they say â€œfor it.â€ These futile notes are now ended by lunch. It was oddly peaceful & sane, getting out here after London. Mr Perkins brought gas masks about 10.30. & so at last we went to bed.

** The boy there the only person I saw obviously frightened & therefore snappy & rudeâ€”poor little wretch.
