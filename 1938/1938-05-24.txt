### Tuesday 24 May

Iâ€™m pleased this morning because Lady Rhondda writes that she is â€œprofoundly excited & moved by 3 Gs.â€ Theo Bosanquet who has a review copy read her extracts. And she thinks it may have a great effect, & signs herself my grateful Outsider. A good omen; because this shows that certain people will be stirred; will think; will discuss: it wont altogether be frittered away. Of course Ly R. is already partly on my side; but again as sheâ€™s highly patriotic & citizenlike she might have been roused to object. Its on the cards that it will make more splash among the ink pots than I thoughtâ€”feeling very dim & cold these last weeks, & indifferent too: & oblivious of the great excitement & intensity with which (certainly) I wrote.

But as the whole of Europe may be in flamesâ€”its on the cards. One more shot at a policeman, & the Germans, Czecks, French will begin the old horror. The 4th of August may come next week. At the moment there is a lull. L. says K. Martin says we say (the P.M.) that we will fight this time. Hitler therefore is chewing his little bristling moustache. But the whole thing trembles: & my book may be like a moth dancing over a bonfireâ€”consumed in less than one second. Morgan rang up yesterday about Rosamondâ€™s great meeting for writers to protest against Spain, for wh. she has hired the Queens Hall. But hasnt asked us. What is he to do? Thinks it foolish. So I let fly a few, guarded hints as to my own attitude. We must attack Hitler in England. â€œThats what Iâ€™m always sayingâ€ he said â€œBut how?â€ â€œOh Iâ€™m in touch with Pippa & Newnhamâ€¦â€ He seemed to sympathise. Anyhow he wont speak at QH. or send a message. Now for the Flower Show; dinner at the Hutch. What am I to wear?

Aeroplanes growling overhead in the cloudy blue sky. They look like sharks, seen through our wavy window. No rain. No fruit. Vegs. dried up.
