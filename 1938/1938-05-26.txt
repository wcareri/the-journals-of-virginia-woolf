Ka had a seizure & died without regaining consciousness. This is from a typed form sent by Chris A.F. this morning. She is buried todayâ€”rainy & dark: & I shall not go to the service. Will is in Canada.

My usual 5 minutes for notes. The PH mood used up. Roger at Cambridge difficult to recover. 3 weeks before Scotland, & rather anxious (though its true Iâ€™m more indifferent than ever before) during these 3 coming out weeks. Mercifully we shall be away mostly. And I think to fill in the time quietly by forcing myself to do a Horace Walpole sketch for America. Why not? It means close reading; alien matter; & just time to do it. I cant broach another R. chapterâ€”too tired of facts.
