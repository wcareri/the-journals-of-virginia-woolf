### Tuesday 26 April

We had our Easter at MH; but as for the sun, it never shone; was colder than Christmas; a grudging lead-coloured sky; razor wind; winter clothes; proofs; much acute despair; curbed however, by the aid of divine philosophy; a joy in discovering Mandevilleâ€™s Bees (this really a fruitful book; the very book I want) then Q. rings up; to warn you: Have you had a letter from Pipsy? Ottoline is dead. They told her P. might die, & the shock killed her; & hes asking you to write about her. (with Mr Wicks & Mr Muzzell exploring the attics for the new room). So I had to write; the horrid little pellet screwed my brain; leaves it giddy. Yet in spite of that here am I sketching out a new book; only dont please impose that huge burden on me again, I implore. Let it be random & tentative; something I can blow of a morning, to relieve myself of Roger: dont, I implore, lay down a scheme; call in all the cosmic immensities; & force my tired & diffident brain to embrace another wholeâ€”all parts contributingâ€”not yet awhile. But to amuse myself, let me note: why not Poyntzet Hall: a centre: all lit. discussed in connection with real little incongruous living humour; & anything that comes into my head; but â€œIâ€ rejected: â€˜Weâ€™ substituted: to whom at the end there shall be an invocation? â€œWeâ€ â€¦ composed of many different things â€¦ we all life, all art, all waifs & straysâ€”a rambling capricious but somehow unified wholeâ€”the present state of my mind? And English country; & a scenic old houseâ€”& a terrace where nursemaids walk? & people passingâ€”& a perpetual variety & change from intensity to prose. & factsâ€”& notes; &â€”but enoâ€™. I must read Roger: & go to Ottâ€™s memorial service, representing also T.Â S. Eliot at his absurd command. 2.30 at Martins in the Fields.
