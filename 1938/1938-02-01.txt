### Tuesday 1 February

Nor can I begin analysing now. Still fairly relieved: shall be more so when the 4 weeks test is over next week. But influenza since last Monday has downed me. And 3 Gs. A week at MH. hard at work. Nessa & Angelica backâ€”dinner at Charleston. Wet, but open fields at last. So home: then temperatures; bed; complete submersal, on the sofa &c. Now down for final corrections. 3 Gs. to be shown up to L. tonight. And I feel quite confident once in a way, & only frustrated because it cant now come out till mid May, & I must remain dumb under the shadow of The Years & Miss Storm Jamesonâ€™s bitter disappointment till then. Never mind. I can make it more compact & the notes shorter & sharper in the time added. This is only a run of my penâ€”the usual treat. Now for sofa.
