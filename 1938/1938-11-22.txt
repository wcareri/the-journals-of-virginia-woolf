### Tuesday 22 November

I meant to write Reflections on my position as a writer. I dont want to read Dante; have 10 minutes over from rehashing Lappin & Lapinova, a story written I think at Asheham 20 years ago or more: when I was writing Night & Day perhaps.

Thats a long stretch. And apparently Iâ€™ve been exalted to a very high position, say about 10 years ago: then was decapitated by Wâ yndham Lewis & Miss Stein; am now I thinkâ€”let me seeâ€”out of date, of course; not a patch, with the young, on Morgan; yet wrote The Waves; yet am unlikely to write anything good again; am a secondrate, & likely, I think, to be discarded altogether. I think thats my public reputation at the moment. It is based largely on C. Connollyâ€™s Cocktail criticism: a sheaf of feathers in the wind. How much do I mind? Less than I expected. But then of course, its all less than I realised. I mean, I never thought I was so famous; so dont feel the decapitation. Yet its true that after The Waves, or Flush, Scrutiny I think found me out. W.L. attacked me. I was aware of an active opposition. Yes I used to be praised by the young & attacked by the elderly. 3 Gs. has queered the pitch. For the G.M. Youngs & the Scrutineers both attack that. And my own friends have sent me to Coventry over it. So my position is ambiguous. Undoubtedly Morganâ€™s reputation is much higher than my own. So is Tomâ€™s. Well? In a way it is a relief. Iâ€™m fundamentally, I think, an outsider. I do my best work & feel most braced with my back to the wall. Its an odd feeling though, writing against the current: difficult entirely to disregard the current. Yet of course I shall. And it remains to be seen if thereâ€™s anything in P.H. In any case I have my critical brain to fall back on. But how widely I feel outside it all: untrapped by the Morgan communist group. And I know, I think, my faults. This is not the measured criticism of my position I meant to write. Iâ€™m not able to go deeply. For heres the usual stir & botherâ€”Nessa back tomorrow, Flossie ill: am I to go Hunting? & so on. A wild wet Sunday at Rodmell; a walk to Muggery; no Quentin; alone; & thank heaven, no message whatever from Rau; so all that strain was gratuitous. An odd reflection: how much anguish I wasted last January. Had I only known then that it would be dispersed thusâ€”
