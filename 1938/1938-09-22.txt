### Thursday 22 September

By mistake I wrote some pages of Roger here; a proof, if proof is needed, as Iâ€™m in the habit of saying, that my books are in a muddle. Yes, at this moment, there are packets of letters to V.B. 1910-1916â€”packets of testimonials for the Oxford Sladeâ€”endless folders, each containing different letters, Press Cuttings, & extracts from books. In between come my own, now numerous, semi-official 3 Gs letters (now sold 7,017..) I never get a disinterested letter: always demands. But all the same we get asked to have Noel & Virginia, Judith, & go to Sissinghurst in order that L. may discuss politics with Harold. No sober silent weeks of work alone all day as weâ€™d planned, when the Bells went. I suppose one enjoys it. Yet I was just getting into the old, very old, rhythm of regular reading, first this book then that; Roger all the morning; walk from 2 to 4; bowls 5 to 6.30: then Madame de Sevigne; get dinner 7.30; read Roger; listen to music; bind Eddieâ€™s Candide; read Siegfried Sassoon; & so bed at 11.30 or so. A very good rhythm; but I can only manage it for a few days it seems. Next week all broken. A minor treat today: solicitor in Lewes; then walk â€¦

The public fluctuates. Chamberlain flying today to Gotesberg (?). A strong opposition has risen. Eden, Churchill & the Lâ abour Party all denounce serving C.S. on the altar & bidding it commit suicide. CS. very dignified & tragic. Everyone calling everyone else a pick pocket. The prospect of another glissade after a minor stop into abyss. All Europe in Hitlerâ€™s keeping. Whatâ€™ll he gobble next? Thats the summary of us in Sussex.
