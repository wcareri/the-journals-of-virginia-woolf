### Saturday 12 March

Hitler has invaded Austria: that is at 10 last night his army crossed the frontier, unresisted. The Austrian national anthem was heard on the wireless for the last time. We got a snatch of dance music from Vienna. This fact, which combines with the Russian trials, like drops of dirty water mixing, puts its thorn into my morning: a pernickety one spent over notes. The strength of the ray emitted from Vienna can therefore be judged. Privately Iâ€™m, as usual at the proof stage, bored with the book which was like a spine to me all last summer; upheld me in the horror of last August; & whirled me like a top miles upon miles over the downs. How can it all have petered out into diluted drivel? But it remains, morally, a spine: the thing I wished to say, though futile. Three USA papers have rejected it; but the Atlantic will pay Â£120 for 12,000 words. Their cable came when Morgan was hereâ€”blown in like thistledownâ€”a very round & voluminous down he is now: but with a breeze behind him: he likes, I think, & very naturally, the praise which now comes from the young. And do I grudge it that he should be the best living novelist? He handed me a cutting, about Roseâ€™s book, in which he is thus saluted. And so, jealous as I am, rather mean always about contemporaries, I got my dejection, to run into the dirty drop. He had been staying with Charles Trevelyan, & had his novelists bag full of small odds & ends there collected: Charles a good sort; dislikes his daughters pets; theyre sick on the carpet; Lady T.â€™s tapestry; the face & shield of the ancestral knight hollow; Macaulayâ€™s books: all noted with a view to the whole, much as I do. Then Rose as usual rang up. Do you like my book? Havent yet read it. Well I do wonder what people will make of it &c. Privately I know they dont take much stock of it. But this reminds me that our last Leonard & Virginia season is perhaps our most brilliant: all the weeklies I think single out Isherwood, Upward, & even Libby Benedict for the highest places. Yes: if there is success in this world, the Hogarth Press has I suppose won what success it could. And money this year will fairly snow us under. Â£4,000 about from The Years: then PÃ©pita &c &c. In fact we have asked Mr Wicks to estimate for a library at MH. in spite of Hitler. But its all a littleâ€”my earningsâ€”in the air. To solidify them I bought 2 pairs of American shoes, with rubber soles, yesterday: item: a paper holder, now holding my great notebooks: item: a chair. & negotiated the exchange of my embroidered tableâ€”The delight of money; buying freely. Yet, puritanically, I spend next to nothing on dress. Mabelâ€™s lugubrious sister copies very cheaply. The delight of spending is to say I want this & buy it outright, especially small articles of furniture & stationary. Perhaps in a fortnight I shall start Roger.
