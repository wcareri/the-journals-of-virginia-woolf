### Saturday 28 May

A pouring wet day as dark as November. Mayâ€”this spring has been blotted from the calendar. Heres my daily canter: which will take the form I suppose of a temperature Chart. The Buzz is beginning, though the little gadfly only emerges from its shell next Thursday. Mrs Lynd in Harperâ€™s Bazaar sneers, says I preach sitting still on a sofa; & Miss Osier or some such name writes to thank & praiseâ€”my grand work &c &c. These first rumours always give the shape of whats to come: I can foretell that those who dislike will sneer at me for a well to do aesthete; & those who approve will echo Rhonddaâ€™s â€œmost excitingâ€ profoundly moving. All reviews & letters will ring changes on those notes; now I have to send a copy to Pippa, with my heart beating: after that it will beat to the time of sneer enthusiasm, enthusiasm sneer. And I rather think I shall sum it all up in 6 months in a pamphlet; & if my facts are challenged get 29 Mâ arsham Street to reply.

To the Caledonian market in my new pinching shoes yesterday, where I bought 6 tea spoons & some flowers. Miss Nielsen came; a daneish bee haunted American lit. prof., entirely distracted by Einstein, & his extra mundane influence upon fiction. L. threaded the maze to the muddle in the centre. I gave up on the outskirts. Rather genuine, naive, a little like Christabel; & as usual much more likeable than her letters. One cant dislike people in the flesh. But she ruined my reading of Walpole to wh. I now happily turn.

L. lunching with Robsons.
