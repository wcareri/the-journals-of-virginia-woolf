### Whit Sunday 5 June

This is the mildest childbirth I have ever had. Compare it with The Years! I wake knowing the yap will begin & never bother my head. Yesterday I had T. & Tide, & various London obscurities: today Observer: Selincourt: A terrible indictment. Sunday Times, N. Statesman, & Spectator, reserved for next week presumably. So the temperature remains steady. I foretell a great many letters on Tuesday night: some anonymous & abusive. But I have already gained my point: Iâ€™m taken seriously, not dismissed as a charming prattler as I feared. The Times yesterday had a paragraph headed â€œMrs Woolfâ€™s call to women. A serious challenge that must be answered by all thinkersâ€â€”or something like that; prefacing the Lit Sup. advt: unknown before I think; & must be some serious intention behind it. A note of ecstasy from Ethel half way through.

Walked on the racecourse: bought stockings cakes in Lewes. Charleston & Bunny to tea today, yesterday the first hot summer day. People in tails & white shirts tripping about Lewes. Glyndebourne in full flower. Mrs Curtis asked us. We refused. Windy today, but still fine, & the sun still activeâ€”after I suppose 2 months drought damp & darkness. The ugliest spring on record. So we were wise to save our holiday, though Iâ€™m so rested now, & writing gaily at P.H. that I dont want very much: to look at the sea however wd. be a relief: we shall attempt Skye, for if we dont now we never shall. L. says we are old. I say we are middle aged.
