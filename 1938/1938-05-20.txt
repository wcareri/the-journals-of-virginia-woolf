### Friday 20 May

Time & again I have meant to write down my expectations, dreads, & so on, waiting the publication onâ€”I think June 2ndâ€”of 3 Gsâ€”but havenâ€™t, because what with living in the solid world of Roger, & then (again this morning) in the airy world of Poyntz Hall I feel extremely little. And dont want to rouse feeling. What Iâ€™m afraid of is the taunt Charm & emptiness. The book I wrote with such violent feelings to relieve that immense pressure will not dimple the surface. That is my fear. Also Iâ€™m uneasy at taking this role in the public eyeâ€”afraid of autobiography in public. But the fears are entirely outbalanced (this is honest) by the immense relief & peace I have gained, & enjoy this moment. Now I am quit of that poison & excitement. Nor is that all. For having spat it out, my mind is made up. I need never recur or repeat. I am an outsider. I can take my way: experiment with my own imagination in my own way. The pack may howl, but it shall never catch me. And even if the packâ€”reviewers, friends, enemiesâ€”pays me no attention or sneers, still Iâ€™m free. This is the actual result of that spiritual conversion (I cant bother to get the right words) in the autumn of 1933â€”or 4â€”when I rushed through London, buying, I remember, a great magnifying glass, from sheer ecstasy, near Blackfriars: when I gave the man who played the harp half a crown for talking to me about his life in the Tube station. The omens are mixed: L. is less excited than I hoped; Nessa highly ambiguous; Miss Hepworth & Mrs Nicholls say â€œWomen owe a great deal to Mrs Woolfâ€ & I have promised Pippa to supply books. Now for R.â€™s letters & Monks Hâ€”at the moment windy & cold.
