But the proofs have not come; & thus I have had a mitigated respite, which has been spent (am) reading R.â€™s letters; trying to decide what to leave out in the School fragment; & collecting the Clifton dossier. Now I shall not be so literal; but what am I to be? And I a little resent so much fact seeking. Also resent being told by some French scribbler that I cant externalise; so to contradict him wish to be intelligentâ€”so wd like to read 3 Gs & see if I am intelligentâ€”& so on. A very fine clear day. A spring without any paralell. so enduring: so constantly unexpected this sun. All the trees are now full out. And no checks. The hyacinths over. So in MH we shall get the full blast. Summer time last Sunday. And today (oh these pensâ€”Iâ€™m always throwing them away & hoping for a better one) â€¦ we may go into society; to a party at Susan Lawrenceâ€™s. Why? God knows, having rejected so many others. Probably our Press takings this year will beat all others: Â£2,500?
