### Friday 16 September

Chamberlain has flown to see Hitler. Universal relief & approval. No news yet. They say this means Peace. Peace was written large on the Evening Standard placard yesterday in London. Thereâ€™ll be no war, the shopkeeper in Long Acre said when I bought cardboard for Eddieâ€™s book. Rosinsky says they will give way. Hitler will save his prestige: the Câ zecho Sâ lovaks will be sacrificed. War staved off for one year. But until the wireless announces the result of the visitâ€”& thereâ€™s to be anotherâ€”tonight we once again mark time. Nessa Duncan Angelica & Q. start for Cassis tonight, driving across France. We settle in for 10 days aloneâ€”that is, Clive & Janice come on Sunday; but I mean to make these 3 weeks serve me to finish, sketch out rather, the last chapters.

Dined at Charleston. All seem agreed that a country life is best. Clive is giving notice to Gordon Square. We hear or rather the Garden Comttee heard, that T. Sqre will be pulled down in 3 years. Shall we not all provide ourselves with single rooms in London & live here? Never make any fixed plans for lifeâ€”thats my motto. Really, for the 10 years that remain, be free of the world. But Iâ€™m kicking my heels with P.H. after Roger this morning, & the relief of fiction after all that fact, lightens the load of both worlds inconceivably. And I feel so free from any criticism; own no authority.

HAL Fisher asks me to go & see him. After my remarks on OMâ€™s this is conciliatory. He wants me to send a signed copy. And his time is drawing out: resignation impending. Very fine clear weather. I saw a kingfisher. The lunch was very heavy, stodgy, full of meat & wine. Walked down the Strand all a buzzing, full season feeling, in the afternoon.
