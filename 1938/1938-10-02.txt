### Sunday 2 October

Yesterday would have been the first day of the proclamation of war. It might be amusing to scribble down pall mall some higgledy piggledy of incidents: as they remain over; & will soon be forgotten.

The BBC in a measured trained voice: how the public was to go with warm clothing: no glasses: post cards: this interrupted by the ArchBâ€™s prayers: then cold menace: a spaced dictated message from the Admiralty to ships. Obviously weâ€™d sunk mines. Then the afternoon (Wednesday) when all foreign stations were jammed. War broken out already L. thought. Then the statement that all poisonous snakes at the Zoo would be killed, & dangerous animals shotâ€”Vision of London ravaged by cobras & tigers. Sense of preparation to the last hair. Some complacency on the part of organisers. How Mrs Nicholls was refused the key of the Square: trenches only available to residents. All this mixture of minute detail; with invocations to God; with Hitler baying & the Germans howling; then the composed & cultured voice breaking in, say about not taking pets. Then over all a feeling of the senselessness, futility, so that there was a dilution of emotion. A childs game. Yet extreme physical relief when peace seemed 24 hours longer. Some instinctive self preservation. I felt this most when we drove away from 52, a selfish gladness that we should be quietly in the country. Some remorse at leaving the clerks exposed. Now rapidly other emotions chase each other; that peace seems dull, solid. Then that we must have a bone to gnaw. The opposition already marshalling & we shall be attacked. Some obliquity: after all we admired Chn. in the crisis. Is it fair to abuse him now? Duff Cooper has resigned. A wet day. Keynes come to tea.
