### Friday 27 May

Its odd to be working at half cock after all those months of high pressure. The result is half an hour every day to write here. Roger Iâ€™m retyping; & shall then sketch Walpole. I have just been signing in bright green ink those circulars. But I will not expatiate on the dreariness of doing things one ought to do. A letter, grateful, from Bruce Richmond, ending my 30 year connection with him & the Lit Sup. How pleased I used to be when L. called me â€œYouâ€™re wanted by the Major Journal!â€ & I ran down to the telephone to take my almost weekly orders at Hogarth House! I learnt a lot of my craft writing for him: how to compress; how to enliven; & also was made to read with a pen & notebook, seriously. I am now waiting for today weekâ€”when thats over, my swell will subside. And cant I prophesy? On the whole I shall get more pain than pleasure; I shall mind the sneers more than I shall enjoy Ly Rhonddaâ€™s enthusiasm. Thereâ€™ll be many sneersâ€”some very angry letters. Some silences. And thenâ€”3 weeks yesterdayâ€”we shall be off. And by July 7th when we come backâ€”or sooner, for we dread too many hotelsâ€”it will be over, almost entirely; & then for 2 years I think I shall publish nothing, save American articles. And this week of waiting is the worst, & its not very badâ€”nothing in the least comparable to the horror of The Years: (that deadened into indifference so sure was I of failure). As for sales, I am not very hopeful; 6 thousand I daresay; the shops are tepid.

Today Iâ€™m had in a corner by a persistent Miss Neilsen, my evening ruined. L. went to his Jury this morning, only to be told â€œYou will be pleased to hear that youâ€™re discharged.â€ So thats over.
