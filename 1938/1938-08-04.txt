### Thursday 4 August

Monks House

What a very silly thing I didâ€”not that it was my fault. I thought I knew the voice, asking for Mrs Woolf: & so got let into conversation with a woman called Coralie Anderson, a Dublin broadcaster, from New Zealand, at Newhaven: & had the idiotic good manners to say she could come to a dull family tea party today: that is, a strange woman, of the most insensitive kind, may, indeed will, walk in, on top of Mrs Woolf Edgar & Sylvia today. And L. will be glum; & Mrs W. resent the interruption. The fact was, Vita was there: hence I answered the telephone. And this is how we escape to the peace of the country. Came down on Thursday; almost mute with botheration: 6 from Charleston on Sunday; Angus & Eddie; then Vita on Tuesday for the night & yesterday; & now this incongruous assembly. Yet we are very happy. I should add that we found a new gable thrown out in the roof, workmen hammering, Mr Wicks started work, without warning, & says he will be here 3 weeks which means 5. Two days ago L. had the brilliant idea of converting half the library into an open air verandah with glass doors, in which we can sit on a hot night & survey the stars. This is now in progress. We shall have a balcony & rails.

It has been very hot with a strong hot wind. And Iâ€™m taking a gallop in fiction, after bringing Roger to his marriage. Rather a jerk & an effort, my work at the moment. Switching from assiduous truth to wild ideas. But I liked seeing Vita, so free & easy again. We sat out here & discussed her loves; death; father Darcy on death; Benâ€™s tears, on being scolded by Vita; Willy Maugham; Clive, whoâ€™s writing a book, secretly, on war; Julian; Nessa; looking so ill; so many women have lost sons & lovers; I forget how it went. Also she brought a basket of peaches & half a bottle of Chateau Yquem from her mothers cellar. Nigel only got a third. He & Harold mind. She doesnt. And off she went in her great black car that impresses Mrs Bartholomew so, to entertain Mrs Rubens & her final husband, who likes fishing. She has a daily visitorâ€”not to sleep though. She was much like old times.

I cant unstring my mind after trying to write about a lily pool. P.H. is to be a series of contrasts. Will it come off? Am I in earnest? Its to end with a play. L. is writing his in the garage room. I note he doesnt like to be asked when will it be done? He has, amusingly, all an artists sensibilities. And now?â€”Well thereâ€™s always a heap of Rogerâ€™s papersâ€”old paper cuttingsâ€”to go through. And I might, of course, revise the last chapter: Beaufort Street; but am waiting for Bobâ€™s notes. What an undertaking! R.â€™s 2 lives enough for 6 books: emotion & art.
