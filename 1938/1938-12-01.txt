### Thursday 1 December

I think it would be a relief to write a free sentence here, after so much churning. And so much fitting in. Let me count the people only: Angelica, silent & reserved took my free Monday evening. On Tuesday, I went to Ethel Sands. Did my tricks in front of Guy Ridley, little Sinclair & Shaw Taylor: ashen coloured heap of ashes, that house. Fine, silver, suffocating. Sally, a smudge, talked of Baba; then Ann & Richard: Sally stayed till 12.30. On Wednesday, Mary at 4, Richard Hughes at 5: Colefax at 6: went to see the moon at Elizabeth Williamsonâ€™s observatory, & did not see it. Tonight Vita. Tomorrow MH. Is it wonderful that I break in upon L. & exclaim we will sell the Press & live in the country? John is making scenes. This adds to the strain. Turns red & gobbles. So whats the point of hoping for a balmy & fruitful future? A very bad season. No sales. Can I afford Dâ uncanâ€™â s Â£40 carpet? Regret Helenâ€™s Â£150: but Iâ€™m a little proud that I made myself write the story & the article in two weeks; & started Roger again. But I have lost the scent. Dont feel him real any more. Chafing & drudgery necessary. Shall work at that till April now. And then rest my head.
