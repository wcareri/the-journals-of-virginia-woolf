### Thursday 13 October

I should be well advised to take a holiday from writing, & maunder off into the vineyards at Cassis. But I cant: too weak minded; dependent upon L.: & lifeâ€™s too fixed. So I must dandle my brain, & find a substitute. Tired, after London yesterday. Cant screw either to PH or Roger. Elizabeth Bowen now? A walk? Pick apples? only 11.30â€”a familiar, but not hopeless, situation. In fact Iâ€™m like a teetotum, thatâ€™s so weighted it always spins, wherever dropped. Only too sleepy today to spin. Finish after a devilish week end. Richard & Ann here. Talk for 48 hours. A nice couple: I like him. Some body & some brain. Charm & integrity. She helter skelter, adolescent, vigour, but I daresay neurotic. Much younger, more uneven than he. Oh & we went to Tilton & read L.â€™s play to the K.s. They gravely approved. M. as intent as a terrier. Very interesting. We like it very much. Suggest the Group Theatre. Off to Cambridge. End of the season. Clive gone already.

Sandbags still in position in Bâ loomsbury Southampton Row being pulled down. Clerks had bought spade & first aid outfit. John reasonable. Nice to come home to duck. Today the first time without workmen. L. arranging books in the gallery.
