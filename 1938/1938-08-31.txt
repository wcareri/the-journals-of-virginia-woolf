### Wednesday 31 August

War seemed round the corner again. Question what Hitler will do, when heâ€™ll do it. Cabinet Ministers summoned. &, of course, Kingsley Martin ringing up, & annoyed that L. isnâ€™t in London to hold his hand, & make it write an article. I say As if articles mattered! We were in London yesterday. Streets fuller than last time, perhaps, by reason of the Crisis. K.M. to lunchâ€”stout & dark & brown & black & theatrical. 3 possibilities. One of them European war. But not at once. A game of bluff on Hâ itlerâ€™s part, possibly. Anyhow he doesnâ€™t want a European war now. So may isolate the shindy; & we may rat with the French at the last moment. If theres a war, â€œmy own solution is suicidalâ€â€”while he munches mutton chops, & sweeps up fragments, scraping his knife & fork round in a way I hate. But cant hate anyone in the flesh. So he burbled on: with his own article, & his own figure, histrionically arrayed, in the centre. Some bye-references, with an eye to me, on the Prostitution of Journalists. I walked off, bought a pewter plate, a scissors, & a lustre globe, encouraged by a letter from Brace reporting enthusiasm for 3 Gs in our office, good advance orders, & great praise. Also encouraged by the Eâ uropeaâ n situation: gather rosebuds while we may. So we came back to find the roof painted a first coat of white; men erecting L.â€™s new Crystal Palace greenhouse in the orchard; & the fireplace ready in the new room.

Sally was mated on Monday, with much coyness: we had tea with Mrs Jones, Hugh, & a sturdy girl whoâ€™s going to teach a school in Bexhill. Mrs Jones like a pricked air ball flopped on the floor. Hugh the spit of Philip.
