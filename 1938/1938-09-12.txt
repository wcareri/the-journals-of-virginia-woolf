### Monday 12 September

Papers all say that we shall know the truth, one way or the other, tonight. But Maynard yesterday thought Hitler may say nothing for some days. The Cabinet all occupied whenever they emergeâ€”sitting all dayâ€”in making plain without actual statement that we shall fight if France fights. Press all harmonious. So thereâ€™s nothing to do but wait.

Memoir Club meeting had its little sensation. Mâ olly & Q. lunched. After lunch, as she came down stairs, M. tripped & fell over the loose tile. Lay very white in great pain. Cdnt move. Obviously a bad twist. After a time we managed to hop her to the terraceâ€”sat & talked; but when we had to go, she couldnâ€™t move. Ankle swollen. So we took her, after various telephones, to Dr Toothâ€™s substitute: & heâ€”a blue serge red faced knobby manâ€”was afraid the bone was hurt. Then the X ray: the man out: at last to Tilton; carried her in. Maynard read a very packed profound & impressive paper so far as I could follow, about Cambridge youth; their philosophy; its consequences; Moore; what it lacked; what it gave. The beauty & unworldliness of it. I was impressed by M. & felt a little flittery & stupid. Then he had to rest; it turned grey & cold. M. had to be slowly conveyedâ€”a bed made on the ground floor at Charleston. Nevertheless a very human satisfactory meeting. Tea: Lydia presiding, â€œNow boys & girls sit down.â€ Hot cakes. Ham sandwiches. No politics. Bunny, Desmond, Q. & Lydia, ourselves Morgan Clive Nessa (in big hat: much more herself than ever yet). Rachel is to have a baby. Molly very much more composed: brave; matter of fact; & heard what we said. But we are off now to lunch with William Plomer at Brighton, taking Morgan.
