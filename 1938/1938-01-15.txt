### Saturday 15 January

In the 5 minutes left me before starting for MH. I cant describe the relief of hearing at 8 on Wednesday: Specimen perfectly normal. You can go awayâ€”Thats where we are at this moment of a wet & windy January. Definitions, explanations can wait. And Iâ€™ve just taken the last pages of the last guinea to Chancery Lane, so deserve one days pause.
