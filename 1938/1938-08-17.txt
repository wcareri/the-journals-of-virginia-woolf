### Wednesday 17 August

No I wonâ€™t go on doing Rogerâ€”abstracting with blood & sweat from the old Articlesâ€”right up to lunch maybe. I will steal 25 minutes â€¦ In fact Iâ€™ve been getting absorbed in Roger. Didnt I say I wouldnâ€™t? Didnt L. say theres no hurry? Except that Iâ€™m 56; & think that Gibbon then allowed himself 12 years, & died instantly. Still why always chafe & urge & strain at the leash? What I want is a season of calm weather. Contemplation. I get this sometimes about 3 am when I always wake, open my window, & look at the sky over the apple trees. A tearing wind last night. Every sort of scenic effectâ€”a prodigious toppling & cleaving & massing, after the sunset that was so amazing L. made me come & look out of the bathroom windowâ€”a flurry of red clouds; hard; a watercolour mass of purple & black, soft as a water ice; thin hard slices of intense green stone; blue stone, & a ripple of crimson light. No: that wont convey it: & then there were the trees in the garden. & the reflected light: our hot pokers burning on the edge of the steep.

Iâ€™m too tired in the head & fingers to sum up. We have been sociable in a scattered way. Seen Edgarâ€™s new house,â€”& Mr Colbourneâ€™s Alsatians, routing Gwenâ€™s pocket handkerchief from a tub of rags, jumping through fiery hoops, & also retrieving L.â€™s bandanna from a distant field. All dogs can do this, Mr C. said. A dog at its prime at 3. Dogs entirely changed by education. For this, see 3 Gs. (wh. stops selling, between 6 & 7000: but still wrings letters from schoolmasters. Oh & I must answer one of them).

I began Mme de Sevigne last night. Then there was the sunset, & then some music on the new set. The window, with the round top, is going in today. Less noise than I expected.

The old woman who lived up at Mt Misery drowned herself 3 days ago. The body was found near Piddinghoeâ€”my usual walk. Her son died; she turned queer; had been a midwife in Brighton; lived in the broken windowed half of Mr Bradfieldâ€™s house. She used to moon over the downs with a dog. Once she came to the shop late on Sunday to beg 2d of paraffinâ€”she was alone in the dark. They threatened to turn her outâ€”farm wanted. She had killed her dog. So at last off she goes, on Monday perhaps when the tide was high in the afternoon, & jumps in. Louie says her brother found a drowned woman the other day at Barcombe Millsâ€”a horrid sight. So I order dinner hastily & come out here to brew more Roger. But I wont go into my doubtsâ€”partly due to reading B.J. by his wife & thinking it richer & warmer & more important than Morgan on Goldie. So, at supper, we discussed our generation: & the prospects of war. Hitler has his million men now under arms. Is it only summer manoeuvres orâ€”? Harold broadcasting in his man of the world manner hints it maybe war. That is the complete ruin not only of civilisation, in Europe, but of our last lap. Quentin conscripted &c. One ceases to think about itâ€”thats all. Goes on discussing the new room, new chair, new books. What else can a gnat on a blade of grass do? And I would like to write PH.: & other things. I worry a little over the young generation & its complacent compromises. This is partly of course that we sold the HP share very cheap: that Mrs Lehmann lives in far greater style than we do; that the young in short have an eye to the main chance, a bitter tongue, & a fawning way of asking sympathy. Thats my nettle under the mattress; but a very little frail oneâ€”not so stinging as a row that once lasted a whole month here with Colefax. I mean one of those nagging worries that I say aloud when Iâ€™m walking.

Tonight we dine off the first grouse at Charleston. Q.â€™s birthday. Oh & we went to Pulborough & saw A. actâ€”but I forgetâ€”I may have written this downâ€”so casual am I in what I say or dont say: & have half a mind one of these days to explain what my intention is in writing these continual diaries. Not publication. Revision? a memoir of my own life? Perhaps. Only other things crop up. Pippa says Waller has been desperately ill. Logan has recoveredâ€”as Logan would.
