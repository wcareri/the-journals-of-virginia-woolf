### Saturday 26 March

On Monday the galleys will go. So I can then seriously turn my mind off onto Frys, Highgate, the past. And this is a fact. And would have been accomplished yesterday were it not that Pippa comes to dinner, to lay more facts before us; & Hugh Jones afterwards: hence jaded yesterday; wind & rain & cold; so to Kew, perversely, with Ann, who stayed till 8. A fine figure, athletic, hardheaded; emotional too I guess, living at Brunswick Sqre with Richard. On Monday they go to Corsica for a family jaunt together. Influenza has attacked Flossie & Clive. Dinners supplied to 8 F. Street. How dull Iâ€™m grown: what they call objective: it needs a good brain to be objective. The crisis still shakes our telephone, the voice of Kingsley appealing to L. to have his mind made. The crisis has once more set it violently in motion. But the lull is hushing us; not very profoundly though. When the tiger, ie Hitler, has digested his dinner he will pounce again. And privately, I have no letters. I must take up life again on Monday: by which I mean ask E. Bowen to tea, buy a new dress off Murray, arrange one or two parties, & not let myself be submerged in Roger quite so completely as in 3 Gs. But that submersal was a remedy; an anodyne. How could I have toiled along these last months without? As usual I have drawn too many words from my well, & want to fill it from some good book. Mandeville The Bees, I think. No sooner do I say this than I am pelted with MSS. Vast meritorious novels, that one cant skimp. My insatiable appetite for reading will glut itself on Roger. Then what? Oh my Outsider papers: The TLS is now a paper like another, not my paper. And some attempts at brief scenes. And the Odyssey. And a few days doing nothing between tea & dinner: the unconscious is asking for a rise.
