### Tuesday 19 July

What about yesterday as a specimen day? Work at Rogerâ€”fearful niggling drudgery till 15 to 1. Robson to lunch. Isherwood wants to see me at 3. I slip out; buy flowers for Madame Alwin, pate de foie for Adrian. Back at 3.15. peep in at Stephen Spender, Chris & John & L. all talking in J.â€™s room. Receive present of deaths head in box from Jack. Sit down upstairs. Visit Adrian, tea on balcony. Dog playing cars passingâ€”Judith there. Ann to marry on Thursday. No invitations. Karin in & out. Look at house. Gossip & home. Will Râ . to dine. A respectable, suppressed, but I dont think quite such a snake as Duncan makes out. Only dimmed, tamed; kindly, fairly obstinate: I think on his guard. No enthusiasm for life:â€”too much high nobility. But of course instructed, experienced, & kind. Only â€¦ Compared with Râ . how blunted, tolerant, & a little plausible. Wished to make out a case, to some extent. Gave me letters. So to bed with sore lips. Nothing vivid about R. & Paris, all dim now. Wdnâ€™t eatâ€”abstemious. Fetched by a chauffeur & car. respectable. But not so slimy as they said.

Mercifully no oneâ€”I repeat no oneâ€”today. Today Julian was killed last year. And its hot again. Angelicaâ€™s first night in Regents Pk Lysistrata. So we go on. I shant say anything to Nessa. Oh dearâ€”And shall I buy Desmond a case? & myself a Chair? Or what? We goâ€”this is an event for usâ€”to the Ballet at Drury Lane in proper seats tonight. 3 Gs selling very slowly. Abusive or sneering letters the last 2 days.
