### Thursday 6 October

Another 10 minutes. Iâ€™m taking a frisk at P.H. at wh. I can only write for one hour. Like the Waves, I enjoy it intensely: head screwed up over Roger. A violent storm two days ago. No walking. Apples down. Electric light cut off. We used the 4 6d candlesticks bought at Woolworths. Dinner cooked, & smoked, on dining room fire. Men now staining boards. The room will be done actually this week. Politics now a mere â€œI told you so â€¦ You didâ€”I didntâ€. I shall cease to read the papers. Sink at last into contemplation. Peace for our life time: why not try to believe it? Cant make a push & go to S. Remy. Want toâ€”dont want to. Long for change; love reading SevignÃ© even by candlelight. Long for London & lights; long for vintage; long for complete solitude. All this discussed with L. walking to Piddinghoe yesterday.

E. Bowen has sent her book; also Marie Mauron.
