### Monday 28 November

More brain churning to add a passage to Lâ appin & Lâ apinova & all my courage needed. Then R.â€™s letters to his father. I can work my brain. So thats all right. And one of these days I shall be off writing what I like. To Harrow yesterday: sudden fog: shouts; terror; never was so suddenly obliterated. Turned & walked at Hampstead. Dinner at Cliveâ€™s. An English Turkey. Duncan flown; argumentative, persistent; chattering against T.Â E. Lawrence &c. amusing.
