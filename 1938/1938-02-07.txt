### Monday 7 February

(Motherâ€™s birthday) where we had by the way a perfect week end, still, brisk spring: crocuses in the garden; birds rapturous; Q. to dine; Hubbard to ask L. advice about divorce. That dour graâ sping Dedman daughter has made his life Hell for 14 years; & now he finds romance in Doris Thompsett. Oh the lives of the poor! But (save for a twinge at the imminence of the sample, & thinking of Nessa) I was very happy: relieved of my book; & tossing ideas as I walked over the downs. For instance: an illustrated sheet to be called The Outsider: a barrel organ tune about The Shrivelled Thorn Furze tree on the downs, through which I see the bungalows: rhymed burlesque. A good idea. But I must do the notes to 3 Gs first.

Nessa, D. & A. dining here.
