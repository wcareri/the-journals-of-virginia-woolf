### Thursday 20 October

52 Tavistock Square.

Only Thursday! It seems 14 days since we left MH. I knew the break would be a jangle; but not that I should feel the mixture of humiliation & dissolution wh. I feel today, after a sleeping draught. And the curious fact is all this is the result of offering to pay Helen Anrepâ€™s overdraught. I thought it wd be 50 it is 150 or 200. So Iâ€™ve committed myself again, on the impulse of the moment: just as Iâ€™d sworn not to. Cant spend freely. Must write an article. And is it worth it? L. at once says he will go shares. No. But why do I hesitate over this? 1. She disliked 3 Gs. I know its the right thing to do. I dont like talking emotionally (about Roger chiefly). Then I was jangled by the temptation of a week at Cassis. L. very divineâ€”walked in the Sq. I dont think I come altogether badly out of it. Iâ€™ve forced myself to work at R. this morning. Theres some taste about it that I dislike. And worrying L. And the sleeping draught heavy on me, like a hand. Yet it is right to give her the money, as sheâ€™s doing without a servant. I mean if one cared for R. this is a way to show itâ€”better than buying clothes or another room. So donâ€™t let me vacillate. Only be more careful in future.
