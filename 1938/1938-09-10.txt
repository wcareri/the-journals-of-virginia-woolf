### Saturday 10 September

I dont feel that the crisis is realâ€”not so real as Roger in 1910 at Gordon Square, about which Iâ€™ve just been writing; & now switch off with some difficulty to use the last 20 minutes that are over before lunch. Of course we may be at war this time next week. Seven ships are mobilised today. The Papers each in turn warns Hitler in the same set grim but composed words, dictated by the Govt, presumably, that if he forces us we shall fight. They are all equally calm & good tempered. Nothing is to be said to provoke. Every allowance is to be made. In fact we are simply marking time as calmly as possible until Monday or Tuesday, when the Oracle will speak. And we mean him to know what we think. The only doubt is whether what we say reaches his own much cumbered long ears. (Iâ€™m thinking of Roger not of Hitlerâ€”how I bless Roger, & wish I could tell him so, for giving me himself to think ofâ€”what a help he remainsâ€”in this welter of unreality.) All these grim men appear to me like grown upâ€™s staring incredulously at a childâ€™s sand castle which for some inexplicable reason has become a real vast castle, needing gunpowder & dynamite to destroy it. Nobody in their senses can believe in it. Yet nobody must tell the truth. So one forgets. Meanwhile the aeroplanes are on the prowl, crossing the downs. Every preparation is made. Sirens will hoot in a particular way when thereâ€™s the first hint of a raid. L. & I no longer talk about it. Much better to play bowls & pick dahlias. Theyâ€™re blazing in the sitting room, orange against the black last night. Our balcony is now up. Today Morgan comes, & we have our crowded Memoir Club week end. It is at Tilton, in the afternoon, to suit Maynard, who is going to read. Q. & Molly lunch here tomorrow, & Iâ€™ve no doubt we shall all behave as if the moment were eternalâ€”as Roger said to Goldie. What other attitudeâ€”but its not oneâ€”is possible to even moderately adult people? As far as I can judge the villagers share it. Whats the use of war? We dont want war. Thats Louieâ€™s verdict. But our candidate, our little Mr Black who dined here the other night, has the brains of a rabbit, reminds me of Tisdall, will only talk of his daughterâ€™s pet miceâ€”she breeds many coloured mice which she sells for 5d to a local breeder, & his other girl makes posters depicting mice, while he himself collects matchboxesâ€”well, heâ€™s the average politician, I suppose: & heâ€™s all for war, at once. Why? to build a new state â€¦ & what kind of new state? One in which mice & matchboxes are collected.
