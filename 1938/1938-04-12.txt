### Tuesday 12 April

Anyhow, on April 1st I think, I started Roger; & with the help of his memoirs have covered the time till Clifton. Much of it donkey work; & I suppose to be re-written. Still there is 20 pages put down, after being so long put off. And it is an immense solace to have this sober drudgery to take to instantly & so tide over the horrid anti climax of 3 Gs. I didnt get so much praise from L. as I hoped. He had to swallow the notes at a gulp though. And I suspect I shall find the page proofs (due tomorrow) a chill bath of disillusionment. But I wantedâ€”how violentlyâ€”how persistently, pressingly compulsorily I cant sayâ€”to write this book; & have a quiet composed feeling; as if I had said my say: take it or leave it; Iâ€™m quit of that; free for fresh adventuresâ€”at the age of 56. Last night I began making up again: Summers night: a complete whole: thatâ€™s my idea. E. Bowen to tea; cut out of coloured cardboard but sterling & sharpedged; Lennox Robinson (bright blue tweeds) called: we have John on us nowâ€”John saddened & hammered by his experiences at Vienna. Kâ .M. still rings up, at inordinate length: Iâ€™ve time to change & write a letter while they talk; its about emigrating now from our doomed Europe. â€œIf it werenâ€™t that I feel I must stay by the paperâ€â€”Also W. Robson is back; gave me the vertebrae of a cow, with his usual kind simplicity, made into a brooch; Easter is on us: Bells at Charleston; hard blue dry weather with a cold wind. Margery F. dines tomorrow; Roger surrounds me; & then to MH on Thursday, & that infernal bundle of proofs.

Am I right though in thinking that it has some importanceâ€”3 Gsâ€”as a point of view: shows industry; fertility; & is, here & there as â€œwell writtenâ€ (considering the technical problemsâ€”quotations arguments &c) as any of my rather skimble skamble works? I think thereâ€™s more to it than to A Room: which, on rereading, seems to me a little egotistic, flaunting, sketchy: but has its brillianceâ€”its speed. Iâ€™m suspicious of the vulgarity of the notes: of a certain insistence.
