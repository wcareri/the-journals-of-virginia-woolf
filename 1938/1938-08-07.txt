### Saturday 7 August

I rather enjoy doing PH. Thats something, for it wont please anyone, if anyone should ever read it. Ann Watkins by the way says the Atlantic readers havenâ€™t read enough of Walpole to understand my article. Refused. Thats another reason then for my Outsider to be born. The Times Lit Sup this week has an article discussing, among other views, Mrs Woolfâ€™s view on intellectual harlotry. I rather think the book wh sells slowly is sinking in. ,

Yesterday I saw 6 tanks with gun carriages come clambering down the hill & assemble like black beetles at Rat Farm. Small boys playing idiotic games for which I pay. Harold is very dismal, Vita says: predicts war, but not this week. A lull at the moment. And terrifically hot. A great purple black cloud massed itself behind Mrs W. Sylvia & Edgar as they sat out here; then thunder: then rain, at last. And we had lights lit. Why they so rub the country bloom offâ€”these family Woolvesâ€”I dont know. Always a dusty feeling of Earls Court & offices. Oh & the commonplaceness of the talkâ€”mostly about furniture at Lexham: lovely silver mirrors, most artistic overmantels, suites of dining room chairs, coffee cups. She lies awake counting them, deciding whoâ€™s to have what, & so falls asleep. Why is it all so low in tone, even as human life? Sylvia might be one slice of bread off the eternal loaf. Workmen tapping. The verandah being cut open. Yesterday the men about the wireless. Too many gadgets & dodges perhaps in this house. And the children shrieking. But we go to Charleston for tea: & Bob has written, revising in some respects my chapter: upon which I start work again tomorrow. I plan a short chapter on marriage; then a difficult one on R.â€™s early work; some discussion of his theories & development; so to Hampstead & America. So to the Post Iâ mpressionists & ourselves. That will make the break in the book. A change of method. Then the Omega: before the war. Then the Dalmeny, Bernard Street. Consummation. So (here at least) the end is in sight. I may have it written over by Xmas; re-written by next August. Out in spring of 1940?
