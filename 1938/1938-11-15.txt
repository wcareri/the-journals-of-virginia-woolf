### Tuesday 15 November

I did not buy the dresser. We cannoned into Rose Macaulay, an incredibly shrunk, hair twisted figure, dealing with her car at a garage. She never saw us. I like these unseen visions. Then I walked to Selfridge: so across all the Parks, following two perfect Guardsmen. A soft & remote blue ceiling of sky over the Park. My one quiet evening since Thursday. Read Chaucer: began Lytton Q.E. & Essex for my article. Ideas popped up, but I want to write fiction, my weeks off, not more hard highroad prose.

Tonight we dine with Clive. Ethel Sands pesters. Fixed for Tuesday fortnight I should say. I am determined not to be a means provider: to have & enjoy things as ends. Otherwise I could go on lending money; earning money in order to lend money; writing books in order to please Nessa & Ha & Helen; no I must dig my feet in & do the things I think my own ends. And so left L. & walked across the park: this was an end, not a passage way to this that & the other. What end shall I make this afternoon? Very foggy which obscures the end. Might have gone to Cockfosters.

I shall read SevignÃ© & Chaucer & 50 Years of a Drs life if it comes from the Library. Many publicity letters. The Cigar quarrel. Inâ l. Liberty appeals & Mrs Moggridge.
