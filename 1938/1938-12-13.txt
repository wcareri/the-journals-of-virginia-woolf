### Monday 13 December

I will spend the last morningâ€”for tomorrow will be an odious scrambleâ€”in summing up the year. True, there are 10 days or so to run; but the liberty of this book allows theseâ€”I was going to say liberties, but my meticulous conscience bids me look for another word. That raises some questions; but I leave them; questions about my concern with the art of writing. On the whole the art becomes absorbingâ€”more? no, I think its been absorbing ever since I was a little creature, scribbling a story in the manner of Hawthorne on the green plush sofa in the drawing room at St Ives while the grown ups dined.

The last dinner of the year was to Tom Eliot last night. Physically he is a little muffin faced; sallow & shadowed; but intent (as I am) on the art of writing. His playâ€”Family Reunion?â€”was the staple of the very bitter cold evening. (The snow is now falling: flakes come through my skylight: I am huddled in my red rain jacket, opportunely given by L.) It has taken him off & on 2 years to write, is an advance upon Murder; in poetry; a new line, with 3 stresses; â€œI dont seem popular this eveningâ€: â€œWhat for do we talk of cancer againâ€ (no: this is not accurate). When the crisis came, his only thought was annoyance that now his play would not be acted. And he hurried up the revision (so David Cecil came to town & divided Melbourne into 2 vols.: so that at least one should be printed).

Tom said the young donâ€™t take art or politics seriously enough. Disappointed in the Auden-Ishâ erwood. He has his grandeur. He said that there are flaws in the new play that are congenital, inalterable. I suspect in the department of humour. He defined the different kinds of influence: a subtle, splitting mind: a man of simple integrity, & the artists ingenuous egotism. Dines out & goes to musical teas; reads poems at Londonderry house; has a humorous sardonic gift which mitigates his egotism; & is on the side of authority. A nice old friends evening. And we did not go to Judithâ€™s party.

This year I have worked at 3 Gs; & began, about April 1st, Roger: whom I have brought to the year 1919. I have also written Walpole; Lappin & Lapinova, & the Art of Biography. John says that 2 cabinet ministers are in favour of giving me the OM. The other candidates are Clemence Dane & Dameâ€”the painter who does circuses. So the compliment is not as high as I should like: though its true I was the chosen â€¦ I mean, preferred; but its only lunch party gossip at Kenneth Clarks.

The reception of 3 Gs. has been interesting, unexpectedâ€”only Iâ€™m not sure what I expected. 8,000 sold. Not one of my friends has mentioned it. My wide circle has widenedâ€”but Iâ€™m altogether in the dark as to the true merits of the book. Is it.. ? No, I wont even formulate qualities; for, its true, no one has yet summed it up. Much less unanimity than about Room of Ones Own. A suspended judgment upon that work then seems fittest. Iâ€™ve written too 120 pages of Pointz Hall. I think of making it a 220 page book. A medley. I rush to it for relief after a long pressure of Fry facts. But I think I see a whole somewhereâ€”it was simply seized, one day, about April, as a dangling thread: no notion what page came next. And then they came. To be written for pleasure.

Money Iâ€™ve summed up: & good resolutions. We shall find the new window in at MH. And its the coldest day for 5 years. Snow steadily falling. John temperamental. Another boil over on Saturday. A very bad season. Probable loss.

Reading Chaucer & Sevigne & the usual trash books. 2 years more of 52. The new flats going up in Southampton Row. Clive leaving 50. A last message from Ottoline this morning. Deaths this year: Ottoline, Ka. Mrs W. recovering.
