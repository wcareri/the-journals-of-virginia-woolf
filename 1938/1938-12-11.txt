### Sunday 11 December

A few scattered notes.

We walked back from 12th Night (disappointing) on a clear cold night. Talked of death in Russell Sqre. L. said he had taught himself not to think about it. 2 or 3 years ago fear of death became an obsession. I said I should not wish to live if he died. But until then found life what? exciting? Yes I think so. He agreed. So we dont think of death. This came from David Cecilâ€™s account of Desmond: who has an idee fixe: his old mothers death; & then cant rouse himself from accusations; how he is war guilty or â€œweâ€ are: the English presumably.

Very long hours of semi-drudgery on R. The war years. I want to sum up my 3 G. conclusions, had I time or brain before the end of the year.

How horribly the year began! As a detail, I chose a gay cover to counteract what I suspectedâ€”L.â€™s serious illness. All that blown away. The rash is caused possibly by Sallyâ€™s hair. Mrs W. has had a heart attack. But her vitality may again pull her over. The Jews obsess her. My private naggery to coin a word for the bone one gnaws at odd moments is Helen taking Â£150 off me with which to supply sympathy to sympathy addicts. But thats unfair. But then one is unfair at 2 in the morning. This autumn reveals plainly our â€˜celebrityâ€™: that is, that we never get a day to ourselves; & attract a constant stream, from all quarters. Political, social, literary. I suppose this is secretly pleasing. I wonder. A month in winter fields will cool me down. Biography writing not much tax on the higher faculties as I perhaps shd. not call my rather doubtful gifts in that line. The young all swarm, even if they criticise. And Iâ€™m working in Rose Macaulay, Tom Eliot, Martin Freud, the Robsons & Ethel Smythâ€”all this week: a hint that I shd. use the morning then for Roger & not scribble, in a hand so worn with writing it hardly writes, any longer.
