Too tired after a dreary dinner at the Hutchinsons to write: so let me scribble. Ka is dead. I read it by chance in the Chronicle yesterday before going to the flower show. No flowers, no mourning. Why did she die? And what do I feel? Oh that one could feel more for the deaths of ones friends! But it comes & goes, feeling. Always at first visualâ€”Ka lying drawn & white, there with the flat sea underneathâ€”the ships passing. And Will pretending, poor little dried squeezed manâ€”all her thought would be for him. Her passion for the boyâ€”that she had left him, unknowing what he was to become, unable to go on educating protecting planning for Mark. I remember going there one spring morning when he was asleep in the perambulator at the door. And she came hurrying out agitated lest we should wake him. Her own identical life ended when Rupert died. So I think. After that she was acting a part very carefully & deliberately chosen. Maternity, Will, public life. Hence some squint; she was never natural, never with me at least. And I was self-conscious; remembering how she had seen me mad. She used to come to Asheham, to Holford: condescending, patronising, giving up her own pleasures to tend me & help L. I dont think I was ever at my ease with her. Yet we had an old affection; remembered thingsâ€”Rupert &câ€”that we never spoke of. She had that irritating Quack Quack in her voice; as if she always must be impressing me with her busyness, her social standing even among the county families; her responsibilities: how she was a JP on some Education Coâ mmiâ ttee; doing actual things with important real people, while we frittered our time away writing books in London. She protested too muchâ€”a sign of dissatisfaction I supposeâ€”with Will? She had to transform him into something noble, unconventional, brilliant, good; from the material which was none of those things really. But she liked Cornwall; so did I. She liked the view that day she took us toâ€”the promontory all silver & blueâ€”the lovely moorâ€”the badger & the foxes barking round the house, & the long drives over Zennor Moor; seeing the gipsy woman in her tent; I daresay alone she was happier than she ever got said. In her houseâ€”a singularly ugly house in some waysâ€”with a kind of formality & no luxurianceâ€”she was too much the hostess who keeps open house. But at the same time that was her role: to help; to lift lame dogs; to entertain; to arrange; manage; receive confidences. And what was wrong with all that? Only that after Rupertâ€™s death she was playing a part. Yet this is superficial. For there was a trustiness in her; a stable goodness; a tenderness under the assumptionâ€”Children, she wd. say & irritated meâ€”& a good deal of fortitude, patience; a determination to oar her wayâ€”Bruin I called her, at the Vienna CafÃ© one day with Rupertâ€”Bruin oaring her wayâ€”with a beavers tail, & short clumsy paws. He liked the image. It conveyed her thickness, breadth. She was very broad cheeked; & her face was long drawn out. In spite of her clumsiness & sturdiness she was very pale. She had thinned & wrinkled last time we stayed there. She wore 2 or 3 good Ringsâ€”cameos with heads on them. She chose bright pure colours for her clothes; wore a coloured handkerchief round her hair; often stuck it with a silver pin: an individual looking woman; derived partly from a John painting; but also practically equipped for her car driving, committees; her endless meetings in St Ives & Truro; she took her place very capably on the Bench: had a great shrewdness & capacity & some humour, only suppressed by Willâ€™s acidity. Now I come to think of it, she had managed her life with great (composure) individuality. There was her cottage at Aldbourne; her ability to make excursions, take charge of situations, oar her way courageously where she wished. I wonder, did she know she was dying? & what did she think of it all? And why? As usual, I regret: that she sent me cream at Christmas, & in the flurry of L.â€™s illness I never wrote & thanked; that she suggested coming, & absorbed in Nessa last autumn, I did not arrange it. But this is always so; & canâ€™t be helped. And I am thinking of her with affectionâ€”old Ka. The deep silence between us was threaded with something that could vibrate, & does: chiefly through the eye at this moment. I can imagine a half smiling So goodbye Children & dont bother. Old Kaâ€™s all right â€¦ But Mark?
