### Monday 22 August

The first, I think, really soaking wet day since we came. We therefore went into Lewes about the threat of the Sewage Pump. They want to plant it on us: â€˜theyâ€™ being instigated by Jansen & Botten so L. suspects. The village cabal against us is roused by the L.P. & the Village Council matter, & they are rumoured (Percy says) to be going to seize our field for a play ground. This delightful sample of village lifeâ€”the egg under the microscopeâ€”doesnâ€™t please: such is human nature. Also I am in the wars, or shall be. Maynard sends for us on Wednesday; is said by Lydia to be very critical of 3 Gs: & a note in the Observer (Hayward) says that Miss Wilson is preparing a counter-blast; & no-one can better correct, contradict & amplify than she. Now the thing to remember is that Iâ€™m an independent & perfectly established human being: no one can bully me: & at the same time nothing shall make me shrivel into a martyr or a bitter persecution maniac. The one specific is to write a thorough good bookâ€”i.e. Roger. Iâ€™ve not got the words right about the soul. I mean I stand on my own feet. Maynard & the rest can only puff: & the honesty of my intention in 3 Gs is bound to see me through. But this is written in too great detail. In fact I must now, as we cant play bowls, read my Roger chapter: after the criticism I must â€¦ but not here. All Charleston & William Plomer yesterday: a lovely thin blue day. Bowls. Nessa painted, better I think. Clive talked. I liked himâ€”he has some shiver of sensibility still.
