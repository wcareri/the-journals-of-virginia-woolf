### Tuesday 26 July

Its very true that I have no time. I have simply dedicated the last fortnight to peopleâ€”seeing peopleâ€”not a day free from it. Always an engagement. If you let it fill your sails thereâ€™s something to be said for it. But Iâ€™m doing it deliberately & so â€¦â€”well: hereâ€™s a list: Elizabeth Bowen Saturday; Lehmann Sunday; Nessa & Duncan; Monday I will keep free after tea: in comes Angelica: but we talked about Julian, & I adored her sobriety & depth; am in doubts if sheâ€™ll stick at acting; today our Bussy dinner & others in afterwards; then Vita (oh she wired Horrified by your letter), to lunch: put off Noel & Virginia; D. asks me to tea to fetch my glass; then shall we go to Lysistrata in Regents Park: so we reach Thursday through this lit up gallery of many faces. And phonesâ€”& books. Buchan & Susie present theirs: Hughes his. And its now one. Iâ€™m staggering through Beaufort St.
