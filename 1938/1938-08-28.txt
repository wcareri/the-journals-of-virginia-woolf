### Sunday 28 August

The character of this summer is extreme drought. Brooks dry. Not a mushroom yet. By the way Maynard never said a word. Some were unsaid. As for instance, Lydia: we all put up with you Virginia, said significantly, kissing me at parting. M. tired, extended, rather grim. But emotion had to be restrained. Sunday is the devils own day at M.H. Dogs, children, bellsâ€¦. there they go for evensong. I cant settle any where. Beaten after 3 hard fights at bowls. Bowls is our mania. Reading rather scamped. Iâ€™m strung into a ball with Rogerâ€”got him, very stiffly to the verge of America. I shall take a dive into fiction; then compose the chapter that leads to the change. But is it readableâ€”& Lord to think of the further compressing & leavening.

Ding dong bellâ€¦. ding dongâ€”why did we settle in a village? And how deliberately we are digging ourselves in! And at any moment the guns may go off & explode us. L. is very black. Hitler has his hounds only very lightly held. A single stepâ€”in Cheko Slovakiaâ€”like the Austrian Archduke in 1914 & again its 1914. Ding dong ding dong. People all strolling up & down the fields. A grey close evening. Dr Chavasse died on Friday, while Nessa & Q. were hereâ€”she to paint the viewâ€”he my table. Oh thank God, Ding dongâ€”no, its begun again.

I should call it a very free summer, happy compared with last. However, I cant go into that. I mean Julianâ€™s ghost. How could he ever become a ghostâ€”My dear Auntâ€”then the burst of laughter; & how he gripped the sides of the chair. Angelica announces that she is giving up the stage. That I think revives Nessa. At any rate they are freeâ€”more unitedâ€”& go to Cassis. I ponderâ€”as usualâ€”a flight to the Maurons. But shall I get there? Sybil meanwhile thrusts herself on us, for dinner; we have the Jonesâ€™s at Seaford: visits to London; must say good bye to Bella. The autumn mists assemble. And Iâ€™m irritable with work & noise. We dine at Charleston. Now its as quiet as the grave .. all grey; the chestnut leaves hanging heavy; birds on the telegraph posts.

Letters fret me. Never one thats disinterested. Requests always to speak, write, lecture, see people. Thats Fameâ€”dogs again. Thats because Miss Emery is with the dead I suppose. Yap Yap. Perhaps the house would be better & Madame de Sevigneâ€”who may inspire me, as good writing does, to write to Ethelâ€”so no more.
