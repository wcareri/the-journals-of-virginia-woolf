### Monday 14 November

So many pages, I see about the Colefax party, & none about the incessant stream here. I use my old image. Trying to drink a cup of tea, & having it knocked out of ones hand. Spenders & Joan; then Hugh, Spenders, Elizabeth & Sybil. Then Helen (on Saturday, my only dayâ€™s solitude) followed by Adrian.

I am a little ruffled: spending my morning writing Biography for America in order to pay off Babaâ€™s debts. So it seems. My Â£150 has been lent; given I suppose; & I must replace it. I feel I maynt have the chance in a year or two. We never reach the pinnacle where I neednâ€™t make owing to myâ€”shall I say generosity? or impulsiveness? Helen cameâ€”oh yesâ€”no doubt she wants the moneyâ€”was desperate, evidently, if I decided not to give it. So I gave it. Voila qui est fait, as Mme de Sevigne says. To school myself against silly puritanism, I instantly spent Â£5.10 on a very charming bookcase. And shall buy a dresser this afternoon. But my brain racked by biography wont describe life; or analyse the lending emotions. Some were very happy. I mean, paying the debt to Roger. Then the reaction. Irritation. Then the refugeesâ€”They clamour. So I dig my toes in: & on the one hand buy furniture; on the other make money.

A letter from Duncan. Complete bliss at Cassis, has a country life in view, Angelica perfect. Soâ€™s the weather today. Jews persecuted, only just over the Channel. Here we feel a faint heat under us, like potatoes frying. But no more than that. I here vow to see no one till Vita on Thursday.
