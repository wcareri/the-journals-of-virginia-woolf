### Sunday 9 January

Yes, I will force myself to begin this cursed year. For one thing I have â€˜finishedâ€™ the last chapter of Three Guineas, & for the first time since I dont know when have stopped writing in the middle of the morning.

How am I to describe â€˜anxietyâ€™? Iâ€™ve battened it down under this incessant writing, thinking, about 3 Gsâ€”as I did in the summer after Julianâ€™s death. Rau has just been, & says there is still a trace of blood: if this continues, L. will have to go next week to a nursing home & be examined. Probably it is the prostate. This may mean an operation. We shall know nothing till Tuesday. What use is there in analysing the feelings of the past 3 weÃ¨ks? He was suddenly worse at Rodmell; we came up on Wednesday:â€”the 28th or thereabouts; since when its been a perpetual strain of waiting for the telephone to ring. What does the analysis show &c? He went to the hospital to be X rayed; has been, is still, in bed. There is a sense in which feelings become habitual, dulled; but only laid under a very thin cover. I walk; work, & so on. Nessa & Angelica & Duncan all at Cassis, which shuts off that relief, but why should she have this forced on her? Anyhow, they come back in a fortnight I suppose.

Harry Stephen, Judith, I think our only visitors. A dead season. No one rings up. Fine today. And the result of writing this page is to make me see how essential it is to steep myself in work; so back to 3 Guineas again. Then the time passes. Writing this it flags.
