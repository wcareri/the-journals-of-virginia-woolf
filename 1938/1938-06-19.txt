### Sunday 19 June

at Housesteads, Thorn trees; sheep. The wall and white headed boys in front. Miles and miles of lavender campagna. One thread coloured frail road crossing the vast uncultivated lonely land. Today all cloud and blue and wind. The wall is a wave with a sharp crest, as of a wave drawn up to break. Then flat. Bogs under the crest. Waiting now for the rain to stop, for it blew and rained that day on the wall. Now a few miles from Corbridge waiting in the middle of the moor. Very black. Larks singing. Lunch deferred. A party of ninety lunching at the Inn at Piercebridge, A sense of local life; 18th century inn diners to celebrate some sport. So on to a Manse in a garden; a very solid private house that takes in residents. Hot ham, and fruit, but real cream, looking over an ugly range. The country early today was fen Wash country. Then the Pennines. These are shrouded in a heat mist. Larks singing. L. now looking for water for Sally, (but this should precede the wall).

Sitting by the road under the Roman wall while L. cleans sparking plugs. And I have been reading translations of Greek verse, and thinking idly. When one reads the mind is like an aeroplane propeller invisibly quick and unconsciousâ€”a state seldom achieved. Not a bad Oxford introduction, trying to be in touch, up to date; scholarly but Oxford. Cows moving to the top of the hill by some simultaneous sympathy. One draws the others. Wind rocks the car. Too windy to climb up and look at the lake. Reason why the hills are still Romanâ€”the landscape immortal â€¦ what they saw I see. The wind, the June wind, the water, and snow. Sheep bedded in the long turf like pearls. No shade, no shelter. Romans looking over the border. Now nothing comes. Also Iâ€™m thinking with an occasional rasp of Vitaâ€™s letterâ€”â€˜misleadingâ€™, could beat me down with fisticuffs. Well let her. But none of this very serious. All the wild white flowers along the grass border in violent agitation. Many buried camps. Grass still takes their shape. Why dig up? Not I think an impressive reconstruction of the pastâ€”too like the foundations of farm buildings, when they do. The outpost feeling though from the little watchtowers remains. Forts to fight from; the wall to look from. In one well a glass bottle was dug up. And the latrines and the treasure house.
