### Tuesday 21 June

Now in Midlothian. Stopping for petrol. On the way to Stirling. Scotch mist driven across the trees. Normal Scots weather. Great hills. Ugly puritanical houses. The Hydro built 90 years ago. A woman called and said she had seen Mrs Woolf walking in Melrose on Saturday. Second sight as I was not there. Galashiels a manufacturing town. Hideous. Fragments of talk overheard at the Hydro Melrose. Soft voiced old Scotch ladies sitting in their accredited places by the fire under the window. â€œI was wondering why you walked about with an umbrella.â€ One who is stitching, â€œI wonder if I should wash it and begin again. Iâ€™m working on a dirty ground.â€

Here I interpose. We stopped at Dryburgh to see Scottâ€™s grave. It is under the broken palanquin of a ruined chapel. Just enough roof to cover it. And there he liesâ€”Sir Walter Scott Baronet, in a caddy made of chocolate blancmange with these words cut large and plain on the lid. As Dame Charlotte who is buried beside him is covered with the same chocolate slab it must have been his taste. And theres something fitting in it. For the Abbey is impressive and the river running at the bottom of the field, and all the old Scots ruins standing round him. I picked a white syringa in memory but lost it. An airy place but Scott is much pressed together. The col. by his side, and Lockhart his son in law at his feet. Then thereâ€™s Haigâ€™s stuck about with dark red poppies.

But the old ladies are discussing Dr John Brown whose brother was a doctor in Melrose. Soon ones head would ache and ones senses fuddle. One would eat too many cakes at tea and theres a huge dinner at 7. â€œI think heâ€™s very niceâ€”her husband. Sheâ€™s got a personality of her own. A very nice cir-r-cle. Where do they live? Retired to Perthshireâ€¦. Iâ€™m three stitches out â€¦ Miss Peace came along to the reading room with her friend and wanted a fire. Couldnt she have rung the bell or something? Out you come! (unpicking the knitting.) Theres so much opened up now. Two years ago was the Centenary (of Dryburgh?). I went to the meeting. There was a serviceâ€”most interesting. All the Ministers. Five on the platform. Possibly the Moderator. At any rate it was very nice and it was a beautiful day and the place was very full. The birds joined in the music. Alan Haigâ€™s birthday. There was a service at Dryburgh. I like D. Iâ€™ve not been to Jedburghâ€”awfully pretty.â€ No, I donâ€™t think I can write it all out. The old creatures are sitting on a sofa not much older than I am I daresay. Yes, theyâ€™re about 65. â€œEdinburghâ€™s niceâ€”I like it. We have to go away before we appreciate it. You have to go away from your birthplace. Then when you go back everything changed. A year does itâ€”2 years do it. I should leave it (of the work) and see the effect afterwards. What church dâ€™you go to? Church of Scotlandâ€”not to St Giles. It used to be the Troon. We go to St Giles. It was St Georgeâ€™s parishâ€”my husband was an elder in St Georgeâ€™s parish Charlotte Square. Dâ€™you like Waugh? I like him in a way. I donâ€™t hear him and its a common complaint. He gives very hard sermonsâ€”you cant take anything away. The choirâ€™s beautiful. I cant get a sitting from which you can hear. I feel it infra dig rushing with the crowd. The crowd hasnt reachedâ€”Iâ€™ve just got to sit stillâ€”Iâ€™m having a serviceâ€”I hear the prayers the young men the music. It was pretty well where they come in from the Thistle chapel. They passed me bang. I rose and moved along. There are some seats the people never come to, and often the best seats. I like St Giles, a lovely old place. The old lady whose seat I had told me the church was all renovated. Chambers did it, and when it came to the opening not a seat retained for the Chambers family. Badly arranged. Someone provided seats for them. A stupid thing. Always some higher church alteration. I like the episcopal. If it be episcopal let it be; if. Church of Scotland, let it be Ch. of Scotland. Dr Waughâ€™s brother is at Dundee. He would like Roseneath. Someone said that the minister at Roseneath is delicate.â€

Wind rages trees leafless bannocks and a blue pound note the only changes. Glencoe. Menacing. Leaf green hills, islands floating, a moving string of cars; no inhabitants, only touristsâ€¦. Ben Nevis with stripes of snow. The sea. Little boats; feeling of Greece and Cornwall. Yellow flags and great foxgloves no farms villages or cottages; a dead land overrun with insects. An old man who could not get up from his chair, two other ladies, her legs overflowing her shoes; all dress for dinner, and sit in the drawing room. This was the good inn at Crianlarich. Lake with hanging stalactites green trees in the middle: bowl of the hills. Hills with velvet leaf green. The Bannington of Eaton Place. She had found winter green for her father-in-law, a botanist. Sky light at 11. Bad review of Three Guineas by G.Â M. Young. Pain lasted ten minutes: over then. Loch Ness swallowed Mrs Hambro. She was wearing pearls.

And then, sick of copying, I tore the rest of it upâ€”a lesson, next journey, not to make endless pencil notes that need copying. Some too I regret: some Boswell experiments in Inns. Also the woman whose grmother worked for the Wordsworths & remembered him an old man in a cloak with a red lining muttering poetry. Sometimes he wd pat the children on the head, but never spoke to them. On the other hand, H. Coleridge was always drinking at the pub with the men
