### Sunday 30 October

Words, words, words, so many & so manyâ€”That I think is the vocalisation of my little sensation this morning. I am tired of writing. At least its a bad life when for some reason one has an intermittence of feeling. Perhaps this is due to the jerk of 2 days at MH: & then straight back, yesterday, from perfect warmth & summer blue to London, dinner with all the Wâ â€™s at Fredaâ€™s Club. This was Lord Spencerâ€™s house. I sat next Martin & Harold & said almost exactly what I said a year ago. These reunions are rather like shows of old clothes. Freda & Alice & Sylvia all stouter; & so on. Mrs W. shrivelled, upheld by a new belt.

â€œWordsâ€ refers partly to Vitaâ€™s new poem, Solitude. Does it jab on the nerve? Is it only sleek eloquence? The words I found on my lips were â€œsuave & sumptuousâ€. I suspect thereâ€™s a good deal more. But no doubt Iâ€™m at an angle, as I say. I dont want reflections on God: nor do I altogether forget her superficial view of 3 Gs: that she never troubled to think out what I meant. This is partly personal; partly not.

Miss Gardiner hauled me out of the Lodge yesterday. The young are reading 3 Gs: it is a revelation. I let her explain. It seemed to explain to us what weâ€™re doing. She gave me Thomas Mann, who does the same. Now Vita never contemplated that quality in 3 Gs.

Nessa away slightly rasps me. I have no circumference; only my inviolable centre: L. to wit. He has been offered Â£500 by Gollancz for a book on Civn. His play will be tried by the Group. Stephen S. thinks it a roaring comedy & very original.

I should like to be quit of all this: am more & more dissatisfied with modern lit: & the criticism thereof; envy painters; yet suspect that I must grate myself upon people to get my sense of â€œwordsâ€ dried up. So dine tomorrow to meet Max &c: & C. Isherwood comes too. I think I shall read Chaucer: & Enâ glisâ h poetry concurrently with French prose. But Iâ€™m word haunted. The ugliness of the W.s in middle life last night rasped me: & their complete lack ofâ€”what? Something I shall find at Sybilâ€™s? I wonder. Fire at Marseilles; Parliament meeting; To the L. out in Dents. CR in Pelican. Asked to write a story for Harpers. Also to give a book to the Ox. Univ. Press. Hugh writes. A great deal on foot. Words words & now roast beef & apple tart. An evening alone.
