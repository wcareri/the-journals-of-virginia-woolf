### Thursday 29 September

We listened in yesterday at 5 expecting to hear that War was declared. Instead â€œMr Chamberlain made a sensational announcement. He has been invited by Herr Hitler to meet him tomorrow at Munich. Signor Mussolini & Daladier will be present. Mobilisation is postponed for 24 hours.â€ It was like coming out of a dark room. Now we are waiting. Some compromise? The selling of the C.S? What? Anyhow war for the moment is postponed. Perkins & Janson called last night to say 50 children arrive in Rodmell today & to note numbers of our rooms. Off to Sissinghurst this afternoon to see Harold.
