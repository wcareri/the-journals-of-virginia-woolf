### Friday 14 October

Two things I mean to do when the long dark evenings come: to write, on the spur of the moment, as now, lots of little poems to go into P.H.: as they may come in handy: to collect, even bind together, my innumerable T.L.S. notes: to consider them as material for some kind of critical book: quotations? comments? ranging all through English lit: as Iâ€™ve read it & noted it during the past 20 years.

Now, having made this note, I must in sober earnest write letters; to Ray: to Joan Easdale, whoâ€™s marrying Jim Rendel; to Suh about her autobiography. In fact I must clear my table, as L. calls it & does itâ€”before we go on Sunday. No more then here. But at last its a fine day: & head better.
