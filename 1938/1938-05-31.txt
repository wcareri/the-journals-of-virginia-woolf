### Tuesday 31 May

A letter from Pippa. She is enthusiastic. So this is the last load off my mindâ€”which weighed it rather heavy, for I felt if I had written all that & it was not to her liking I should have to brace myself pretty severely in my own private esteem. But she says its the very thing for which they have panted; & the poison is now drawn. Now I can face the music, or donkeys bray or geeses cackle by the Reviews so indifferently that (truthfully) I find myself forgetting that theyâ€™ll all be out this week end. Never have I faced review day so composedly. Also I dont much mind my Cambridge friends either. Maynard may have a gibe; but what care I? And I shant send copies to my family, & so they need say nothing. What the bemedalled Wolves, with whom we dined last night, will say I dont know, but would find probably amusing. And the old Prostitutes, Hugh, Compton Mackenzie, Guedalla, Storm Jameson &c who are meeting next week to declare their belief in Libertyâ€”well, theyâ€™re not going to show it save on the platform, & can hardly deny me the right they preach. So I expect a good deal of fun one way & another: some teasing of venerable gents; some innuendos, some digs at the Lynds & Squires; as well as a fountain of effusion from the faithful. But its the fun I shall enjoy: Hughâ€™s elaborate defence of his creative zest for honours & cheques.

The dinner last night was a severe middleclass patriarchal grind: Tâ om & Bâ ella had been to Court. â€œHe looked the type of a beautiful manâ€ Mrs W. saidâ€”â€œin all his medals & cocked hat & Bella with her tiara, & no flowersâ€”they wd. have hidden the medalsâ€. A very long dinner, hard chairs & very forced cheery talk. But we get off easily.
