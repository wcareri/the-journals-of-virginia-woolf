### Saturday 11 June

Only five minutes to record the merciful fact that the N.S. is out (K. John prattling is foolish but as L. says well meaning) & now, save for the Sunday Times, the ink splash is over, & I can count it on the whole a good deal better than I expected. On the whole 3 Gs is taken seriously: many high compliments; some snarls (Spring in the E. Standard has his hackles up) but generally kind, rather surprised, & its overâ€” Off we can go to Scotland for a holiday that I dont really need, but still a freshener before Roger wont come amiss. No book ever slid from me so secretly & smoothly. Letters begin from America, about the extract in the Atlantic. None, save Pippa Ray & an amusingly tepid one from Judith, who likes it very much but thinks the end diffuse. No thanks: no enthusiasm from the young for whom I toiled. But thats as I expected, & as it should be. Ray & Pippa are the prime relief. Nothing from Pernel, or Vita. Sales began slowly; but today & yesterday, 300 sold. I think 10,000 will go off. And its hit the crest of the wave. Tom being given his degree at Cambridge: walking in procession with the other bigwigs: Trinity feast; Tattoo; honours Listâ€”if anyone reads it, the illustration is pat to hand. Quit of all this, Iâ€™ve written an article on Walpole, very fast & free, for America. Walked several good walks. Weather much recovered, though unstable. Mrs Ebbs put the School meeting off. We go up this evening after tea. Bowls. Bells. & the garden being planted by L. with some little help from me. And I must go in to cold mutton.
