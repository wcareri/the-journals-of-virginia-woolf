### Tuesday 5 July

A thunderstorm, still further to distract my already distracted brain. How am I to calm & contract back again to Roger? We returned on Saturday. Now this morning I settled to a difficult passage in P.H. Pippa rings up. 20 minutes with her about 3 Gs. L. comes in & asks me to choose 3 quotes for the Observer. Nessa brings Maynard on Julian. Lightning. Torrents. Yet I must slide beneath all this if Iâ€™m to make a job of the summer lap. I think I will read Roger tonight, & so slide down into the water, & I will use this final half hour of a ruined morning to type out my Skye notesâ€”not that theyre worth it, save as an authentic relic, like a sprig or leaf torn from a hedge & pressed between the pages of a book. My hand staggers. I will type.
