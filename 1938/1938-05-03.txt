### Tuesday 3 May

Pouring now; the drought broken; the worst spring on record; my pens diseased, even the new box; my eyes ache with Roger, & Iâ€™m a little appalled at the prospect of the grind this book will be. I must somehow shorten & loosen; I cant (remember) stretch out a long painstaking literal book: later I must generalise & let fly. But then, what about all the letters? How can one cut loose from facts, when there they are, contradicting my theories? A problem. But Iâ€™m convinced I cant physically, strain after an RA portrait.

What was I going to say with this defective nib? Heres L. to ask me what I think Libby Benedict looks like? I guess fat & Jewish: sheâ€™s thin & Jewish. I think I suspect our first breach with John. Itâ€™ll be over his fashion complex. HP must be in the movement. Wants to reject the Kabbalah (a powerful Arnold Bennett novel) because its old fashioned. And what line am I to take about a story for New Writing: when I dont mean to be a signpost to that gang of elderly novelties? These are our problems. Mrs Nicholls also a problem. A flashy underworld flibbertigibbet on the surface; daughter of a Hastings Dr: has a child: the child has tonsils. Mrs N. very â€œnaiveâ€: has kept underworld company. Lange has waddled off; gooselike; into what line of life we dont know. I have very few letters. And we take our treat on Friday now, & went to St Albans, in the grey blizzard; & saw Roman pavements, guarded by men in overcoats, attending upon imbecile sons. Had tea, & heard the local ladies discussing the Empire Day celebrations, which are to include a red white & blue cake decorated with flags. What will they say to 3 Gs? But Iâ€™m philosophic, fundamentally; & feel, as Iâ€™ve said, oddly quit of it all. A Row in the papers about Wyndham Lewisâ€™s rejected portrait of Tom: & Tom has to be represented at Ottâ€™s funeral. Clive at Charleston. Sunday evening alone with Nessa: oh dearâ€”That signifies my desperation: Julian not there, I mean. The wound bleeding; & nothing to be said. So I will buy a chair this wet day, in order to keep moving.
