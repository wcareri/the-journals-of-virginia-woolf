### Monday 20 June

Scotch border: Monday ten to eleven. Sitting in the car looking across a vast spread emerald tinted little hills rising a great flow of green land. Some bars of trees otherwise grass, uncultivated, no roads. Carter Fell behind; ripples of hills in the distance; a few single scattered trees. One red brown field; some tent shaped hills. Board has Scotland written on itâ€”a moor road. How Scott must have come this wayâ€”near Jedburgh. Burke Sir Walter. A cold windy day with blue slabs consequent floating colours. A novelist should be able to describe two spinsters sisters opening letters at breakfastâ€”letters with stamped addresses. â€œHow awfully stupidâ€”I said the 18thâ€ (a fragment from the breakfast table at Chollerford. These old ladies caught me smoking a cigar. They played patience ferociously; but not on Sunday. Then they read solid books.)
