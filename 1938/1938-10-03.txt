### Monday 3 October

The Keynes to tea yesterday. All a put up job between Chamberlain & Hitler, Maynard said. Never had been any chance of war. But Iâ€™ve written this to Nessa & cant repeat. I wish I could get the ripples of all these complexities to land. Iâ€™m incapable still of sinking into Roger Rain. Wind. Apples falling. M. & Lydia very congenialâ€”dear old M. so sanguine, so powerful, somehow lovable too, & Lord how brilliant. I kissed him. Hope all is forgotten & forgiven. A life timeâ€”what remainsâ€”of peace now. Auden & I.â€™s play to be suppressed. Out of date. And I hope they will no longer pose as the young men to be sacrificed. All orientations must now change. Duff Cooper resigned. Reaction of shame beginning. D.T. decent, & starts a pro Czech movement. Times disgraceful. Harold censured &c.
