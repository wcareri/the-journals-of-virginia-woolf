### Sunday 17 July

No timeâ€”Time wasted writing an angry letter to John about New Writing: letter shown to L. & torn up. My new clock says its just on one: & my new clock cant lie. So I note: 3 Gs has struck the rock of rage, I think; & sells very littleâ€”almost on 6,000â€”wont reach the 8â€¦ Then oh the rush of people. Susie telling me in strict confidence of her unutterable gilded fly boredom. Memoir Club. Desmond dined. Molly ill. Bunny read. Last night at the Robsons. Old French woman in skimpy black; beautiful eyes, playing Beethoven & looking round like Mitz at Juliette: their faces playing: voluptuous absorption & sorrow & exaltation. Lovely brown swollen celloâ€”Old lady wd have been congenial to Roger. Rothenstein tomorrow to discuss Roger. Iâ€™m stuck in a bristle of dates. Cant get on. Wet, black coldâ€”worst July on recordâ€”Morganâ€™s pageant. Kathleen Knott & Eddie dined. Ben & Judith & Rose afterwards. Still letters come about 3 Gs. On the whole Iâ€™m pleased at the splash in the inkpots & hidden references in papersâ€”indirect results. Not a word said of it by any of my family or intimates
