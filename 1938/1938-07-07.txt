### Thursday 7 July

Oh the appalling grind of getting back to Roger, after these violent oscillations: 3 Gs. & P.H. How can I concentrate upon minute facts in letters? This morning I have forced myself back to Failand in 1888. But Gumbo last night threw cold water on the whole idea of biography of those who have no lives. Roger had, she says, no life that can be written. I daresay this is true. And here am I sweating over minute facts. Its all too minute & tied down & documented. Is it to be done on this scale? Is he interesting to other people in that light? I think I will go on doggedly till I meet him myselfâ€”1909â€”& then attempt something more fictitious. But must plod on through all these letters till then. I think contrast the 2 all the time. My view, his & other peoples. And then his books. Meanwhile Freud (son) & John Lunch:. Sarton to tea; & Iâ€™m so raddled & raked with people, noise, telephonesâ€”cant copy my Skye notes: have endless letters to write, long for peace; holiday seems over; & what can I recover from all this litter? 3 Gâ€™s selling wellâ : 5,400 I think. But if I get into that mood I cant do anything at Roger. I must order & lay my mind out in pigeon holes. Now to change for lunch.
