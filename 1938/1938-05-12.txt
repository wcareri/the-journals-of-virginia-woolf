Lunch Clive (balderdash, respectability rampant; hard superficiality) to Philipâ€™s after tea. Shook hands with Grey Millie. Two interesting things: that Ott. confided everything in M. whom she had had all M.â€™s life: the other the vast importance she attached to her Memoirs. To be saved in a fire before anything. They were her justification; the proof to herself I suppose & the world that Ott was not what they thought. Sat in the upper room with P. kindly, I wary. Simple. Some little reserve; touched hands over the ring. He pressed things on me. I felt rather uncomfortable: a vulture feeling; didnt want to take so much. But took the big green ring & pearl earrings, shawl & fan. A kind of ripple of laughter at myself â€œdoing well out of Ottolineâ€. But thats not the whole. P. has been left out of it all as he said. O. when dying last summer, suddenly named Hacket, a vulgar Irish peasant, P. says, joint lit. executor with Bob. G. Hardy & Hope. I advised P. to write a solid memoir at once. He will, but am I to add a chapter? We had out the great box with all the orange bound books she used to keep on a stoolâ€”all full. Whats to be done? And then the great bedspread? Julian despises the old curiosity shop side of O. Wont look at these things. O. not a good motherâ€”didnâ€™t want children. P. rather batteredâ€”simple, cheerful, with a vast black satin cravat. Had a bad heart, from an old rowing strain. The specialist thinking Ott. an ordinary wife said â€œDo you want the truth?â€ Yes. â€œWell any shock will kill you. How old? 67. You wont see 68â€”except you live like a potato.â€ She burst into tears, which she seldom did. Then he recovered, she got illâ€”paralysedâ€”some nerve affection. They then told her of the Drs. death: she was sick all night; recovered; & suddenly died in the early morning. She had written though a letter of farewell to the duke as if expecting this. Drawing room littered & unkempt. A lovely thrush egg blue evening; domes & chimneys very pure & sharp walking home with my green shagreen box the shawl & the fan. O.â€™s last gifts.
