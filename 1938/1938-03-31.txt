### Thursday 31 March

But I have too much drudgery donkey work, now correcting proofs of notes, to write, or to invite: Rose & Jeremy Hutchinson dining tonight. And the nibs are wrong. And I detest my own now paralytic hand. Two pages of Roger written: then that cup dashed down by proofs. Then thereâ€™ll be page proofs. Walking in the City the great relief. Leather Lane & Nevilleâ€™s Courtâ€”both new groundâ€”& the Cut with its stale fishâ€”yesterday. Then Ethel Smyth. Then K. Martin with his eternal article after dinner. Then MH & LP tomorrow. So its not yet possible to dive into darkness. And Iâ€™ve just bought E. FitzGerald on Sevigne, & may broach her. Very hot again. No letters again. Colefax snubbed short. L. writing his playâ€”the one heâ€™s brewed these 10 years & more. This is his only free week. Then accounts. John still abroad. He was in Vienna for the Hitler coup. Sheilah Grant Duff to come tonight. Oh & Judith & Ann about the place, with Richard, & a minute figure called Shawn.
