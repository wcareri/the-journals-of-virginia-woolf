### Saturday 17 September

Chamberlain back. In a hard business manâ€™s voice told us, as he stepped out of the plane at Croydon, that he was to meet Hitler again: that Hitler was coming to meet an old man half way (is this symbolical?) & we meanwhile not to believe rumour. No statement today. Cabinet meeting. Just as in violent personal anxiety, the public lapses, into complete indifference. One can feel no more at the moment. And its the essence of an English September. Saw the yearling sale at Northease yesterday. Mrs Mounsey writes to ask me to head an Outsidersâ€™ movement. Clive & Janice tomorrow. Nessa &c lunching now at Auppegardâ€”& thats all for the moment. I thought yesterday, enjoying my valley walk, that Julian wd entirely have approved of that. And, oddly enough, I never said that the whole summer here was set on its feet the first day by L. visiting the Lewes Dr who pronounced him absolutely normal. Yet I suppose it was the most important feeling of all. We met on the towing path the very day after we came here.

Dreamt of Julian one night: how he came back: I implored him not to go to Spain. He promised. Then I saw his wounds. Dreamt of Roger last night. How he had not died. I praised Cezanne. And told him how I admired his writing. Exactly the old relationship. Perhaps easier to get this in dreams, because one has dreamt away the fact of his death, to which I woke as L. came in.
