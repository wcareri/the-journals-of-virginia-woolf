### Friday 3 June

Rodmell

This is the coming out day of 3 Gs. And the Lit Sup has 2 columns & a leader; & the Referee a great black Bar Woman declares sex war; or some such caption. And it makes so much less difference than any other cackle on coming out day that Iâ€™ve written quietly at Poyntz Hall; havenâ€™t even troubled to read R. Lynd, nor look at the Ref: nor read through the Times article. Its true I have a sense of quiet & relief. But no wish to read reviews, or hear opinions. I wonder why this is? Because its a fact I want to communicate rather than a poem? I daresay something of the kind. Mercifully we have 50 miles of felt between ourselves & the din. L. has been talking to Mrs Ebbs about the school, & finally won her over by praising her new chintz covers, hideous as they are. Then I found a grass snake sunning itself in the hedge, but when L. came, it was gone. Then Mrs Curtis wired to ask us to go to Macbeth at Glyndebourne. Refused. It is sunny, warm, dry & like a June day but will rain later. Oh it pleased me that the Lit Sup says Iâ€™m the most brilliant pamphleteer in England. Also that this book may mark an epoch if taken seriously. Also that the Listener says I am scrupulously fair, & puritanically deny myself flights. But thats about all.

Anyhow thats the end of six years floundering, striving, much agony, some ecstasy: lumping the Years & 3 Gs together as one bookâ€”as indeed they are. And now I can be off again, as indeed I long to be. Oh to be private, alone, submerged.

I talked to Nessa about Julian on Wednesday. She can hardly speak. What matters compared with that? Yet I was always thinking of Julian when I wrote.
