### Monday 5 September

Its odd to be sitting here, looking up little facts about Roger & the Mâ etropolitan Mâ useum in New York, with a sparrow tapping on my roof this fine September morning when it may be the 3rd Aug 1914 â€¦ What would war mean? Darkness, strain: I suppose conceivably death. And all the horror of friends: & Quentin â€¦ All that lies over the water in the brain of that ridiculous little man. Why ridiculous? Because none of it fits. Encloses no reality. Death & war & darkness representing nothing that any human being from the Pork butcher to the Prime Minister cares one straw about. Not liberty, not life â€¦ merely a housemaids dream. And we woke from that dream & have the Cenotaph to remind us of the fruits. Well I cant spread my mind wide enoâ€™ to take it in, intelligibly. If it were real, one cd. make something of it. But as it is it merely grumbles, in an inarticulate way, behind reality. We may hear his mad voice vociferating tonight. Nuremberg rally begun: but it goes on for another week. And what will be happening this time 10 days? Suppose we skim across, still at any moment, any accident may suddenly bring out the uproar. But this time everyoneâ€™s agog. Thats the difference. And as weâ€™re all equally in the dark we cant cluster & gossip; we are beginning to feel the herd impulse: everyone asks everyone, Any news? What dâ€™you think? The only answer is, wait & see. Sybil fresh from London, can only titivate this answer into shapes that reveal her own complicity, but utter ignorance. The talk, when she came that wet evening all the way from London to dine, turned most satisfactorily upon the Windsors; & how, as he came late into Willy Maughamâ€™s lunch party, he said, â€œHer Royal Highness was detained by the American sailorsâ€¦â€ That is what he will have her called.

Old Mr Thomsett meanwhile after driving horses to the brooks & about the fields for 74 years has died in the hospital. & L. is to read his will on Wednesday. He left it allâ€”how much?â€”to Doris; & Annie thinks the other children will protest. L. made his will for him. I like this in L.
