### Tuesday 22 March

The public world very notably invaded the private at MH. last week end. Almost war: almost expected to hear it announced. And England, as they say, humiliated. And the man in uniform exalted. Suicides. Refugees turned back from Newhaven. Aeroplanes droning over the house. L. up to his eyes in the usual hectic negotiations. The Labour Party hemming & hawing. And I looked at Quentin & thought Theyll take you. And then, just as in private crises, a sudden lull. The tension relaxes, whether really or only because no one can keep it up; again the Torso case, the private English disputes come to the surface. And it was like Juneâ€”& so remainsâ€”bland sunny blue; with the thought of Julian dead, somehow not pointless; but I keep thinking why is he not here to see the daffodils; the old beggar womanâ€”the swans;â€”a useless thought: but one that comes so near the surface at Charleston, as if we were all thinking, & might see him.

I am drowsing away my last 20 minutes, having once more tried to recast the last page. Now I must ward off the old depression: the book finished, whats the use of it, feeling. So yesterday I went to Wapping Old Stairs, & roamed through Shadwell & Whitechapel; a change, as complete as France or Italy. Then Tom to dinner, & to Stephenâ€™s Judge. A moving play: genuine; simple; sincere; the mother like Nessa. Too much poetic eloquence. But I was given the release of poetry: the end, where they murmur Peace freedom an artistâ€™s, not an egoistâ€™s end. He gave me a copy, & wants me to write an opinion. I like him always: his large sensitive sincerity better than the contorted nerve drawn brilliancy of the others â€¦ And a certain richness; but only about 50 people there. And Iâ€™m too eye dazzled to write more.
