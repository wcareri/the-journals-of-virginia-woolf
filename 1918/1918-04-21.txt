### Sunday 21 April

How many poor people, clergymen & retired officers for the most part, must be tapping the glass & looking gloomily at their lawns covered with withered blossomâ€”withered still half closed, & then blown off the twig. Orchards must be ruined by this time. At Kew yesterday the magnolias were a most melancholy sight; the great pinkish buds just ready to burst into the most magnificent of flowers, & now browned & shrivelled never to open, & while they live to be ugly. We noticed several branches ending in white gloves, according to L. a sign that some experiment in grafting is being tried. Even the daffodils are all blown crooked. Fruit trees brown & nipped. The weather goes on with its wind & rain & occasional snow. I went to a concert at the Palladium this afternoon; but on the whole I regretted it. A man called Julian Clifford played Mozart as if it were a Dream Waltz, slowly & sentimentally & with a kind of lugubrious stickiness which spoilt my pleasure in the G. Minor. L. to Staines. I must now write to Desmond, who has been telephoning, I fear, with thoughts of that review.
