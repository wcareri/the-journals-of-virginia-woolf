### Saturday 12 October

The first week in London is always one of the richest; & the rich weeks always tend to pass unrecorded. I have my anniversary to celebrate also; this diary is one year old, & looking back I see how exactly one repeats oneâ€™s doings. For example this week we went to buy an overcoat for L.; last year we bought boots. Again there was the question of a party; again what I may euphemistically call an â€˜argumentâ€™. Nessa was in London too; & I dined with her & Clive, only there was Duncan too, & we dined at Gordon Square. But Lord Greyâ€™s meeting has no counterpart last year; nor could I possibly have written then, as I can now write that tomorrow morningâ€™s paper may bring news of an armistice. Possibly the fighting will be over this time next week. Whatever we have done this week has had this extraordinary back ground of hope; a tremendously enlarged version of the feeling I can remember as a child as Christmas approached. The Northcliffe papers do all they can to insist upon the indispensability & delight of war. They magnify our victories to make our mouths water for more; they shout with joy when the Germans sink the Irish mail; but they do also show some signs of apprehension that Wilsonâ€™s terms may be accepted. L. has just come in from Staines with a paper which says, with obvious gloom, that the rumour is that Germany agrees to evacuation. She is not, of course, they add, to be allowed to make any sort of terms. Meanwhile Philip is in the thick of it, & Maurice Daviesâ€™ son has been killed.

Greyâ€™s meeting was impressive as meetings go, which is not saying very much of course; but it does amount to saying that Grey himself struck me as a solid straightforward English Squire, curiously like Uncle Herbert magnified, in appearance, & with the kind of open air honour & sagacity which one feels to some extent in a man like Waller (Jack Hills). He said nothing but what one has read & agreed with about a League of Nations, but he said it simply, & for a â€˜great statesmanâ€™ to have sense & human feeling & no bombast does produce an odd sense of wonder & humility in me, as if human nature were worth something after all. I donâ€™t extend my charity to Lord Harcourt however, who sat in front of us, or to Mrs Asquith & Elizabeth; they were in no way venerable or even striking; but one sees that Mrs A. has triumphed by virtue of a whipcord vitality; she is as tense as a stretched bow; as lean & wiry as a whippet; vibrating like a fiddle; but not a trace (Iâ€™m judging by my view of her profile) of any thing more profound or interesting, & as for poor pasty Elizabeth she seemed to have come straight from behind Marshall & Snelgroveâ€™s millinery counter. There was an enormous audience, & as we left people were passing about the rumour that the Kaiser had abdicated.

I went on to my dinner at Gordon Square; thence to the Coliseum with Nessa, where we had to sit out an infinite length of Miss Clarice Mayne, after which we saw our balletâ€”Scheâ€”(I canâ€™t achieve either the spelling or the speaking of it) which isnâ€™t one of the best, & when I saw it I remembered it better done at Covent Garden. Maynard who has the generosity & something of the manner now of an oriental prince, had hired a brougham for Nessaâ€”an infinitely small, slow, antiquated carriage drawn by a very liverystables looking quadruped. Roger, Duncan, Maynard, Nessa & I all crammed in & padded along slowly across London to Chelsea. Somehow we passed Ottoline, brilliantly painted, as garish as a strumpet, displayed in the midst of omnibuses under an arc lamp; & she reappeared in the Sitwellâ€™s drawing room. I had made acquaintance with the two Sitwell brothers the day before (at 46 Gordon Square), & been invited to the party. That very morning a review by me of Edith Sitwellâ€™s poems had appeared in the Times. Itâ€™s strange how whole groups of people suddenly swim complete into oneâ€™s life. This group to which Gertler & Mary H. are attached was unknown to me a year ago. I surveyed them with considerable, almost disquieting calm. What is there to be excited about, or to quarrel over, in a party like this, I asked myself; & found myself saying the most maternal things to Gertler, who was wearing evening dress, bought from the tipsy Mr Dallas, for the first time. We stood & compared our sensations. Edith Sitwell is a very tall young woman, wearing a permanently startled expression, & curiously finished off with a high green silk headdress, concealing her hair, so that it is not known whether she has any. Otherwise, I was familiar with everyone, I think. Nina Haninet, Mary H., Jack H., Ottoline, Sheppard, Norton & so forth. I found myself discoursing to Sheppard about Sophocles. Never before have I seen him even momentarily serious.

â€œI think of nothing but Greek plays, he said, & peopleâ€”And Iâ€™m not sure that I donâ€™t always see people as if they were in Greek plays.â€ I liked him better than before; still I think he found it awkward to stand discussing Sophocles seriously; & so we parted. My complete mastery of evening parties is shown by the indifference with which I am deserted, & the composure with which I decide upon my next choice. I was a good deal impressed by this; & how calmly too, I looked at my watch, & saw it was time to leave, & went out alone, & drove to Sloane Square, not excited, not depressed, but contemplative & introspective.
