### Monday 24 June

The League of Nations intrigue hasnâ€™t stayed in our favour, owing to various chicaneries practised by Sir Willoughby after the General Meeting. But Iâ€™m not competent to give a clear account of them. The amusing thing to me is to see Adrian transformed into an orator, an agitator, a man with convictions. I canâ€™t take it quite seriously; I mean I attribute it partly to his need of defending his own attitude as a C.O. He is a little sheepish; & yet works out points, circulates letters, whips up converts, & organises meetings of the godly at the 17 Club, where they plan the most extreme measures. Its odd how people invariably fall into these separate groups, & canâ€™t be united, each asserting a complete grasp of the right. But all this week has been harassed beyond any enjoyment by the great servant question. As I havenâ€™t traced the stages, I wonâ€™t begin now. The question was whether N. & L. should go to Nessa for 3 months. At first they agreed with gladness; then they hesitated; then they asked for assurance that we would have them back; then they formally accepted; then they violently refused; then Trissie arrived, on a sudden, as ambassador; spent the night, argued, won her case & lost it again. Finally she and I found a widow & child in Soho who take the place; & now all is as it was, after more conversations, emotions, letters, telegrams, parleyings, compromises & diplomacies than would have set Europe in flame. Trissieâ€™s character, so far as I can make out, is the one thing irretrievably damaged in our eyes; the rest have slightly risen in value. At one stage in this agony, Gertler & Kot dined with us. Gertler is a plump white young man, got up for the occasion very sprucely in sponge bag trousers. His face is a little tight & pinched; but the word he would wish one to use of him is evidently â€œpowerfulâ€. There is something condensed in all Jews. His mind certainly has a powerful spring to it. He is also evidently an immense egoist. He means by sheer will power to conquer art. But bating this sort of aggressiveness, he was well worth talking to. L. noticed his amazing quickness. He would soon have told us the story of his life. I felt about him, as about some women, that unnatural repressions have forced him into unnatural assertions. He examined our furniture & pictures. He likes shiny lodging house things best, he said. He has never felt akin to anyone. He thinks himself very much cleverer than most painters. Kot sat indulgently silent, professing scarcely to notice what was before his eyes. They both described their Jewish families. On Gertler, as upon Murry & Katherine, rests to my feeling the shadow of the underworld. You could put no trust in him; on principle, I can imagine, he is unscrupulous. Kot is differentâ€”rather in the style of the solid lodging house furniture, but with an air of romance.

We had a visit from Margaret; which opened with a tremendous broadside of cooperative shop; lamentations, aspirations & too sanguine expectations; all exaggerated, so I felt, in comparison with their real value. The vote at Congress against Peace seems to her of unspeakable importance & horror. She still talks of resigning next year; but we were interrupted in this by a strange attack in one of L.â€™s eyes; he dashed off to the chemist, & left alone with Margaret I became purely ribald. L. got Fergusson to take out a small fly; came back, & went on again, & M. stayed till the last train. She is a fine specimen of the public woman; a type, after all, no less marked than the literary type, though not yet so fully observed & recorded. Their eccentricities keep me amused, when to tell the truth, Iâ€™ve ceased to follow their plots & denunciations. They have the habit of considering themselves driven to death, overwhelmed with work, without a possibility of rest; & never once since Iâ€™ve known her has Margaret owned to any state of health save that of being very tired. But these peculiarities are not more than jokes to me; & the directness & superb vigour of her character always overcome me with admiration. Given a keener mind, or a subtler, or some sort of discipline that sheâ€™s never had, she might have done marvels. I sometimes guess that she thinks her work less good than it should have been. Or it may be only the terrific shadow of old age, in to which no one, not Roger or Goldie or any of them, can enter without a shudder.

But these remarks on public servants might be written over again for Ka too. She dined with us last night & slept, leaving punctually for her office this morning. With an effort she will talk of other things, but she seems bent & bowed under a load of responsibility, which I believe to be timber at present. In addition, she broods over the war. Her own happiness, I suppose, went out very completely with Rupertâ€™s death; & I fancy sheâ€™s making up her mind to a life infinitely poorer & colder than she expected. If this is so, her illusion about the value of a desk in the shipping office, & her hallucination about her own driven, exhausted, harassed condition are merciful. To us, they seemed a little excessive. Its the atmosphere bred in an office as much as anything, the common attitude. Sheâ€™s been offered a Hall at Newnham. So we all step into the ranks of the middle aged, the responsible people, the burden bearers. It makes me a little melancholy. Failure would keep us young at any rate.

Before tea this afternoon I finished setting up the last words of Katherineâ€™s storiesâ€”68 pages.
