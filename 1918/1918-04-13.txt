### Saturday 13 April

L.â€™s farewell party was freely sprinkled with our non conforming friends. I donâ€™t know why their virtues in combination are so depressing. There was Dora & Adrian & Karin (she announces that she is with child) & Burns & Alix & so on. Bertie broken down, & safe to be imprisoned either for his article or for his conscience. The new bill rakes in all the elder generations. All their consciences are now being racked; but so far they seem inclined to stop short of prison.

Friday was a pleasant day; the sun out, & the blossom & leaves of a natural colour. We spent the afternoon printing. It was the first evening we had alone for a long time. Sunk deep in our chairs we were interrupted in our books by Walter Lamb. Upon review of the conversation we agreed that he was slightly above his usual level. He told long stories of his walk in a snowstorm, with every detail given a prominence more interesting to him than to us; the wildest romance would be flattened, however, by that voice. Lord Canterbury is again to the fore. He is a Persian scholar & has given W. the Arabian Nights. He lives in a house which is not fashionable enough to do him justice. He has an Italian footman who secures meat from a friend in any quantity. A small loin of lamb was left at W.â€™s door the other morning. He expects to fall again before the temptation. He has given up reading, finding no time for it; but examines boys in the Classics. Told us stories about J. J. Thompson, whose mother keeps a small shop where Watty used to buy sweets as a boy. So we slipped on; W. sitting between us, L. yawning without concealment, I yawning with an attempt at concealment. The Academy is storing its precious pictures, only 18 in number, in some Tube. They are told to expect immense bombs at the end of the month, which will dig 20 feet deep, & then explode.

Today Saturday we printed, & finished 6 pages. As we only began on Tuesday we have done a record. A cold dismal day, & very bad news in the newspapers. Stout red-faced elderly men are visibly perturbed. And Ireland has Conscription. If one didnâ€™t feel that politics are an elaborate game got up to keep a pack of men trained for that sport in condition, one might be dismal; one sometimes is dismal; sometimes I try to worry out what some of the phrases weâ€™re ruled by mean. I doubt whether most people even do that. Liberty, for instance.

Last night Desmond rang us up. Iâ€™m afraid our friendsâ€™ motives wonâ€™t stand scrutiny. His book comes out on Monday; he, though forgetting everything, yet remembers a vague joking promise of mine, uttered at least a year ago, to review it in the Times. He is sending me a copy. He wants to stay here. Iâ€™m now debating how to deal with these damned authorsâ€”
