No, I canâ€™t write to Margaret Davies. I spent on her the first flush of ideas after teaâ€”It is fatal not to write the thing one wants to write at the moment of wanting to write it. Never thwart a natural process. I had so much to say here too. First, how the weather has changed, & we are on the verge of winter. Our clocks were put back on Sunday night; simultaneously I went into thick clothes; the sun lost half its heat, the nights became bitterly cold; we began to burn wood before tea; to dine by lamplight; & to shiver without fur coats on our beds. But the impulse that was to unite & fashion & give sequence to my head full of ideas perished on the ill suited page to Margaret Davies.
