### Friday 15 November

Iâ€™ve no money to buy another book; besides by waiting the paper question may once more take its place in the scale of my pleasures; good books, cheap books, books that make one wish to finish them in order to have the pleasure of buying another may be built up against the wall in stationers shops. Peace is rapidly dissolving into the light of common day. You can go to London without meeting more than two drunk soldiers; only an occasional crowd blocks the street. In a day or two it will be impossible for a private to threaten to knock out the brains of an officer, as I saw done the other day in Shaftesbury Avenue. But mentally the change is marked too. Instead of feeling all day & going home through dark streets that the whole people, willing or not, were concentrated on a single point, one feels now that the whole bunch has burst asunder & flown off with the utmost vigour in different directions. We are once more a nation of individuals. Some people care for football; others for racing; others for dancing; others forâ€”oh, well, theyâ€™re all running about very gaily, getting out of their uniforms & taking up their private affairs again. Coming home from the Club tonight I thought for a moment that it must still be sunset, owing to the sharp bright lights in Piccadilly Circus. The streets are crowded with people quite at their ease; & the shops blazoning unshaded lights. Yet its depressing too. We have stretched our minds to consider something universal at any rate; we contract them at once to the squabbles of Lloyd George, & a General Election. The papers are unreadable. Oneâ€™s sense of perspective is so changed that one cannot see at first what meaning all this gossip of parties can possibly have; one canâ€™t be interested. Other people have more right to be sluggish than I have. One predicts a year or two of laxity save on the part of the professionals. They will have things their own way. Masses will play football & cricket & take shooting in the country. The first effect of peace on our circle is to set Desmond loose, & to bring Gerald Shove up to London saying that he must find a way of making Â£500 a year. Before long the crowd of out of work intellectuals looking for places will be considerable. Desmond is doing what he knows how to do supremely wellâ€”going later & later to the office every day & taking longer for lunch, & sometimes not going back again. This he proposes to continue for a fortnight; then to fold up his blue & gold coat for everâ€”unless by cutting off the brass buttons he can make it do for an ordinary coat. His spirits are very high, though depressed occasionally by the question of earning a living. It came out that he means to suggest himself for Solomon Eagleâ€™s place on the New Statesman; for the Eagle is flying higher. â€œI know so many people who write wellâ€ he said; & if that were all, he would make a perfect editor. After tea he told us the last section of the Ireniad. I suppose it would fill a book, from start to finish. It ended, characteristically, with his promising to go to lunchâ€”& waiting eleven years before he saw her again. The story brought her back very plainly; perhaps his conclusion was rightâ€”one ought to pity any woman who is engaged to a young Cambridge man who has never been in love beforeâ€”a young Cambridge man, I should add, who has read & has by heart all the novels of Henry James.

I was interrupted somewhere on this page by the arrival of Mr Eliot. Mr Eliot is well expressed by his nameâ€”a polished, cultivated, elaborate young American, talking so slow, that each word seems to have special finish allotted it. But beneath the surface, it is fairly evident that he is very intellectual, intolerant, with strong views of his own, & a poetic creed. Iâ€™m sorry to say that this sets up Ezra Pound & Wyndham Lewis as great poets, or in the current phrase â€œvery interestingâ€ writers. He admires Mr Joyce immensely. He produced 3 or 4 poems for us to look atâ€”the fruit of two years, since he works all day in a Bank, & in his reasonable way thinks regular work good for people of nervous constitutions. I became more or less conscious of a very intricate & highly organised framework of poetic belief; owing to his caution, & his excessive care in the use of language we did not discover much about it. I think he believes in â€œliving phrasesâ€ & their difference from dead ones; in writing with extreme care, in observing all syntax & grammar; & so making this new poetry flower on the stem of the oldest.

As an illustration of Eliotâ€™s views I may add what Desmond has just (Thursday 21st Nov.) told me; D. asked him how on earth he came to add that remark at the end of a poem on his Aunt & the Boston Evening Transcript that phrase about an infinitely long street, & â€œI like La Rochefoucauld saying good byeâ€ (or words to that effect). Eliot replied that they were a recollection of Danteâ€™s Purgatorio!
