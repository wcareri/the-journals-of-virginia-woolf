### Tuesday 29 January

the after effects of the raid were swept aside by Barbara.

â€œVirginia, I shanâ€™t come on Friday because Iâ€™m going to be married.â€  
â€œYouâ€™re going to marryâ€”?â€  
â€œYes, Nick.â€  
â€œAnd Saxon?â€  
â€œSaxon doesnâ€™t mind. Nothingâ€™s to be changed. Weâ€™re all agreed.â€

These are the terms. I dont myself think that she wishes to be married; but has convinced herself that she should. Moreover, the horror of Nickâ€™s return in a month keeps her graver than otherwise. She showed no wish to be congratulated or in any way fussed over. She stayed & printed as usual. And, expecting a raid, we asked her to sleep. This time it began at 9.10: the warning at least. It was far louder this time. An aeroplane went over the house about 11.30. Soon after, the guns were so near that I didnâ€™t like to fetch a pair of shoes left in the bedroom. We had arranged mattresses in the kitchen & after the first noise slackened we lay all together, L. on the kitchen table, like a picture of slum life. One thud came very near; but in an hour we had the bugles, & went up to bed. The thud, wh. L. distinguished from the rest, came from the explosion of bombs at Kew. Nine people, I think killed. Servants became plaintive, & Lottie began talking of the effect upon her head; they hint that we ought to leave London.
