### Tuesday 9 April

This is most curious weather; also most unpleasant. Rain descends at intervals from a dark grey sky; even when it isnâ€™t raining the sky is still grey. Its warm, damp, & the young leaves have a lurid look in the winter atmosphere; the green is as if seen at night by electric lights. We quarrelled yesterday, about my jug of cream; & L. was unreasonable, & I was generous. The quarrel ended at 4.25 sharp. At 4.30 Miss Mattaei arrived. I remember her at Newnham. She has left, we understand, â€œunder a cloudâ€. It is easy to see from her limp, apologetic attitude that the cloud has sapped her powers of resistance. We skirted round the war, but she edged away from it, & it seemed altogether odious that anyone should be afraid to declare her opinionsâ€”as if a dog used to excessive beating, dreaded even the raising of a hand. She & L. discussed their business, which has to do with Wâ ar. & Pâ eace. & may result in an offer to her of a place on the staff. She has to earn her living. â€œI must tell you one thing, she said, when the talk was over, my father was a German. I find it makes a good deal of differenceâ€”it is a distinct hindrance commercially.â€ L. agreed that it was. She is a lanky gawky unattractive woman, about 35, with a complexion that blotches red & shiny suddenly; dressed in her best, which was inconceivably stiff & ugly. But she has a quick mind, & is an enthusiast; said she loved writing.
