### Tuesday 5 February

Karin came to give her lecture. She arrived at tea time. I canâ€™t help being reminded by her of one of our lost dogsâ€”Tinker most of all. She fairly races round a room, snuffs the corners of the chairs & tables, wags her tail as hard as she can, & snatches at any scrap of talk as if she were sharp set; & she eats a great deal of food too, like a dog. This extreme energy may be connected with deafness. She has become a Bolshevik. She has offered her services to the Labour party, & hopes theyâ€™ll send her up & down England, organising constituencies, since sheâ€™s tired of reading & writingâ€”never did much like it, & now scents a scrimmage & wants to be in the thick of it. Socialism is nibbling at our friends in a curious way. She & Adrian have scruples about the size of their income, & wish to earn money, partly because half their income depends on Mrs B. She gave her paper on League of Nations well, though speaking too quick. The difference that education makes is very marked though. I think they took her points. I was surprised to hear that she was much relieved when it was done. She stayed the night, & the next morning, which with a fitness of simile now to be explained, costs me a tooth to lose. Moreover, she sits over the fire, & I have to shout. But I see that Adrian must find her energy, her not fastidious or critical but generous & warm blooded mind, her honesty & stability a great standbyâ€”
