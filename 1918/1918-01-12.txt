### Saturday 12 January

Now that printing has set in (weâ€™re at page 18) there isnâ€™t much to write down, though the day seems as well filled as a picture puzzle with succeeding events. We are still without baths, & this lends some severity to other restrictions which we have to suffer. Today, we can only get one small joint of beef, which is to last a week. There is no fat to be had; no margarine, no nutter. We are reduced to 1 lb of butter a week; eggs are 5d each, a chicken anything from 10/ to 15/. Mrs Langston made Sunday dinner last week off sausages & bread & drippingâ€”â€œNever had such a Sunday dinner for 5 & 20 years.â€

After printing we allow ourselves a short walk, & saw a vision of Tinker,â€”all but the nose accurate; but each dog has an unmistakable impression. The hope of peace all broken up again; policies once more a running in every direction, so far as one can tell.
