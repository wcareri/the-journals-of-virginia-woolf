### Saturday 9 November

Lord Mayorâ€™s day among other things, & one of the two last of war, I suppose. Itâ€™s just possible that Lottie may bring us news that the armistice is signed within an hour. People buy papers at a great rate; but except for an occasional buzz round a newspaper boy & a number of shop girls provided with The Evening News in the train one feels nothing different in the atmosphere. The general state perhaps is one of dazed surfeit; here weâ€™ve had one great relief after another; you hear the paper boys calling out that Turkey has surrendered, or Austria given up, & the mind doesnâ€™t do very much with it; was the whole thing too remote & meaningless to come home to one, either in action or in ceasing to act? Katherine Murry, whom I saw on Wednesday, inclines to think that most people have grasped neither war nor peace. Two or three weeks ago I heard a citizen holding forth to a lady in the train, who asked him whether he thought there would be peace.

â€œI hope notâ€¦. Weâ€™re giving them everything they want & getting nothing.â€ Since then it is difficult to see how the most bloodthirsty citizens can squeeze anything more out of Germany. The Kaiser still wears a phantom kind of crown. Otherwise there is revolution, & a kind of partial awakenment, one fancies, on the part of the people to the unreality of the whole affair. Suppose we wake up too?

We began to set up Kew Gardens this weekâ€”Thursday was the first day of it, I think. MacDermott has surrendered his Â£7: after a little ineffective shuffling. On Wednesday I went up to Hampstead; found the tall ugly villa looking over the valley where the Murrys live. Katherine was up, but husky & feeble, crawling about the room like an old woman. How far she is ill, one cant say. She impresses one a little unfavourably at firstâ€”then more favourably. I think she has a kind of childlikeness somewhere which has been much disfigured, but still exists. Illness, she said, breaks down oneâ€™s privacy so that one canâ€™t writeâ€”The long story she has written breathes nothing but hate. Murry & the Monster watch & wait on her, till she hates them both; she trusts no one; she finds no â€˜realityâ€™.
