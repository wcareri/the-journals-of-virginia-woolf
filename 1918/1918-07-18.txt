### Thursday 18 July

L. spent 3 hours trying to make sense of Sir Willoughby Dickinson & the rest; & at 4 I met him in the Reading Room of the London Library. First, however, I met a milk white horse in St Jamesâ€™ Square, wearing an ancient Spanish saddle, mounted upon red embroidered velvet. An old men led it. No sign of advertisement was visible. Perhaps some great Duke rides abroad like this. We went on to tea at the Clubâ€”& what a tea! Two dry biscuits, so that we had to resort to cake on coming home. All the copies that we glued yesterday have gone white in the back. We dont know the cause. Richmond rang up to offer me Rupertâ€™s Life for next week. I told him that I should like to explain Rupert to the public. He agreed that there was much misunderstanding. â€œHe was a very jolly sort of fellowâ€; he said. Iâ€™m trying to get letters out of James.

The Germans are not succeeding this time, & the weather is windy, hot, violently wet, & sunny all in turn. We are once more getting safe through the moon.
