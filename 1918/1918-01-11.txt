### Friday 11 January

Another sedentary day, which must however be entered for the sake of recording that the Lords have passed the Suffrage Bill. I dont feel much more importantâ€”perhaps slightly so. Its like a knighthood; might be useful to impress people one despises. But there are other aspects of it naturally. L. to lunch with Ka & a Serbian; I set up, & now find it easily possible to finish a page in an afternoon. L. back, & we took a round by the river, & so home to tea, a great many books. (Life of Keats at last).
