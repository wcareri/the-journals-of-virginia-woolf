### Thursday 11 April

To the 17 Club this afternoon. But one must describe the weather. Imagine living inside a yellow balloon, the ceiling of which floats up & down, with an atmosphere inside of exhausted air. Such is our situation. When the ceiling sinks nearly to the top of our heads we have to turn on the electric light; as we did at luncheon. Occasionally rain falls, but brings no relief. Going to London all the lights in the train were on. I went to the Omega, got my pictures & ran into Roger, carrying a roll of manuscript, which was, he said, his translation of the Lysistrata. This he has done, on a moderate knowledge of Greek, & wishes to have acted, but doubts how far one can go. I carried the pictures all the way to Gerrard Street, stopping at Poland Street to pay 5/6 & get my old gold watch, whose distinction & dignity are very marked after 6 months of Ingersoll. At the Club I foundâ€”need I repeat that old scene once more? I think the change from toast to roll & honey interested me more than the fragments of Scurr Cousins & Marshall, or than the pale constrained solemnity of poor Alix. Having robbed her of a fortnight with James I felt rather guilty. L. came in from the Natives meeting. He is going up again to a farewell party to Bertie at Mrs Hamiltonâ€™s. Last night he went, for less than 30 minutes, to a Labour Party meeting.
