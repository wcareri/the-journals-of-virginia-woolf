### Tuesday 16 July

On Saturday we took it into our head to do a little marketing, since the book is off our hands temporarily; & so went to Kingston with a basket, but found peas & beans much the same price there as here. L. bought a vellum Grotius at a bookshop which promised better than it produced.

On Sunday, a wettish cloudy day as all these days have been since the Duke of Rutland fell on his knees, we went to Staines to say goodbye to Philip who has notice to go to the front on Monday. I cant help having a good deal of sympathy with my mother in law, not only in this parting but in her general attitude to life. It is so lacking in self-consciousness; & has a natural kind of rightness & wisdom, though she never says a clever thing, & in fact says many foolish ones, & her conventions are so absurd that they scarcely count. We walked up & down a narrow lane between beds of Herbertâ€™s vegetables; & she cried; & laughed; & then gave me 2 large eggs; & ran about among all her children, very lively & haphazard, & affectionate, evidently liking this sort of miscellaneous company of sons & their wives better than anything on earth. But to give this effect I should need a chapter, & rather hope one of these days to take one.

Monday, was as usual a day for London & tea at the Club. I was so foolish as to fritter 3/â€”1/6 on the blue penholder with which I write, &, when I dont write suck; 1/6 on paper, at a grossly extravagant shop in Pall Mall. I justified these extravagances by the fact that you can get into the National Gallery for nothing. I spent an hour wandering there, & then came back & tried to describe my impressions to Vanessa. But I see why I like pictures; its as things that stir me to describe them; but then only certain pictures do this; & I insist (for the sake of my aesthetic soul) that I donâ€™t want to read stories or emotions or anything of the kind into them; only pictures that appeal to my plastic sense of words make me want to have them for still life in my novel. But the atmosphere of picture galleries, always gloomy, is worse than ever now, when the glory of war has to be taught by a life size portrait of Lord Kitchener, & almost life size battle scenes; though as the battles are 18th century battles, one can only look upon them as scenes in a gymnasium on rather a large scale. I forget now who was at the Club for tea; but one may still safely seat Alix in one chair, & dress her in green gray coat & skirt with a leather belt round her waist, & a despatch box by her side. As sheâ€™s not doing work for Alix one canâ€™t tell whats in the despatch box.

Tuesday was a day when I stayed at home & folded & stapled paper. A French secretary from Mr David Davies interrupted me. L. makes Tuesday a kind of receptacle for shooting meetings into.

On Wednesday 17th we glued 50 copies of Prelude. So far our present supply is ample. It seems doubtful whether we shall sell more than a hundred. Clive writes a tolerant but not enthusiastic letter about it. â€œDoesnâ€™t set the Thames on fire, or turn his fastidious headâ€ so he says. Bob Trevelyan dined with us, & Adrian came in late. Bob has been through the great crisis of his lifeâ€”which will find him in talk for many a day. He has escaped the army, & may now go either to France or Holland. His literary work is interrupted very seriously. He upset me so by his statement that in his absence Bessy would â€œlive with Crompton Daviesâ€”I mean stay with him.â€”In fact sheâ€™s there tonight to see how she likes itâ€”â€ that I did nothing but laugh, at discreet intervals. Leonard & Adrian joined in. He is a ridiculous figure precisely like the false Mandrill, especially now that heâ€™s bent with the rheumatic, & can only creep & crawl. He is one of our egoists; whatâ€™s more he manages to be more malevolent than anyone I know, under a cover of extreme good nature. He reminds me of the man with the pointed stick, who picks up scraps of paper. So Bob collects every scrap of gossip within reachâ€”& even stretches after those that are still beyond his reach. He told me that â€œheâ€™d heard I was taking my book about to publishersâ€, who presumably, refuse to take it. Then he lamented the failure of K.M.â€™s story; accepting my corrections of both statements, but so half heartedly that heâ€™ll repeat them wherever he goes. He insisted, too that he had met me at the Verrallsâ€™, when he was an undergraduate in the 90tiesâ€”And he rambled over a long argument about great musicians & great writers; & he praised our friends books with one breath & found rather more fault than he had given praise with the other. But his relish of all this gossip & malevolence is such that you canâ€™t grudge it him. He went off at 9.30 this morning with L. & talked all the way up in the train about his experiences before the Tribunal.
