### Saturday 30 November

I see Iâ€™ve been rather slack, & I cant remember now exactly whatâ€™s made me slack. Certainly not the General Election. Iâ€™ve reduced my reading of newspapers, though the Dâ aily. Nâ ews. has an extra sheet. They somehow keep it up. Mrs Dacre Fox bellows in the High St. McDermott demands a government which will make the Germans pay. He prints poster after poster in red ink. Iâ€™ve a new niece, Judith, not welcomed, but made the best of; & Barbara has a Judith too; & Saxon dined here, talking of death without enthusiasm. He knew for certain that he would die on a certain day last summer & thenâ€”didnâ€™t.

One night we went to the Russian dancers; & it was incongruous enough to see what they offered the tolerant good tempered public who had been bellowing like bulls over the efforts of a man to nail a carpet down. They were tolerant, but, as I fancied, a little bit contemptuous of all this posing & springing against a flat blue wall. What a queer fate it isâ€”always to be the spectator of the public, never part of it. This is part of the reason why I go weekly to see K.M. up at Hampstead, for there at any rate we make a public of two. On Thursday Murry came in, & we had an awkward, interesting talk; too self conscious to be enkindling. I think something or other is a little inharmonious in both of them;â€”in my arrogance, I suppose I feel them both too much of the underworld, with all sorts of nostrums of their own; & all this talk about being artists. I dont express what I mean. Perhaps all I mean is that they seem suspiciousâ€”Beneath the surface I expect that they are both very anxious for appreciation, not at all sure of themselves, & Murry wrings his brains dry, & becomes more & more hopeless of finding anything to believe in. I dont like married couples where the husband admires the wifeâ€™s work immensely.

Arthur Ponsonby came up & spoke to us at the Club the other day. He is standing somewhere, & wants to get in, if only to prove that his side has a good case; he said he didnâ€™t much care to be in Parliament itself. A weak, moderately intelligent, kindly man, permanently puzzled, & worried too, by the strange order of the world. Living in a social class different from the one he was born into may account for this. Then we had Dr Leys to lunch on Wednesday (27th, I put in by way of mark). He has spent 17 years in East Africa, & being a very sterling direct Scotchman has a terrible tale to tell about the natives. How they concentrate, how bare of superfluity they are, these professional intellectual men!

Printing off on our little machine began today, & now I must give my very best attention to Murryâ€™s manuscript, A Fable for Critics, which I brought home in my bag, with a view to printing.
