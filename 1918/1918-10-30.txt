### Wednesday 30 October

Just in from a walk in the Park on this incredibly lovely autumn day. Various houses have orange berries growing upon them; the beech trees are so bright that everything looks pale after you have looked at them. (How I dislike writing directly after reading Mrs H. Ward!â€”she is as great a menace to health of mind as influenza to the body.) We talked of peace: how the sausage balloons will be hauled down, & gold coins dribble in; & how people will soon forget all about the war, & the fruits of our victory will grow as dusty as ornaments under glass cases in lodging house drawing rooms. How often will the good people of Richmond rejoice to think that liberty has been won for the good people of Potsdam? I can believe though that we shall be more arrogant about our own virtues. The Times still talks of the possibility of another season, in order to carry the war into Germany, & there imprint a respect for liberty in the German peasants. I think the distance of the average person from feelings of this sort is the only safeguard & assurance that we shall settle down again neither better nor worse.

We had a day in London yesterday; ending for me in talks with Ka & James at the Club, which now renews its life apparently. Ka has ceased to be a bureaucrat owing to Willâ€™s illness; shed power as a chestnut its husk; & remains untouched within. James just back from Cornwall, where he had the influenza. Alix back too; without having the influenza & ready, I suppose to begin her autumn campaign, which Oliver bets that she will win. I here note that I bought my new battery on Tues. Oct. 29th; so far of extreme brilliance.
