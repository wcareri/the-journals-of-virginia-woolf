### Tuesday 7 May

I write expecting Philip Morrell to dinnerâ€”not that one need dwell upon thatâ€”Wind East & violent rain & grey sky again. A letter from Harry Stephen, suggesting a visit, as if heâ€™d been in the habit of dropping in after dinner once a week all these years. The ties of blood? Something very odd moves in the Stephen brain. L. better, though not entirely right. The tooth was an ancient mammoth. I must read Loganâ€™s Trivia now. L. has gone to a [League of Nations] meeting at the House of Commons. Iâ€™ve had a rush of books as usual: three Tchekovs, Logan, Squire, & Merrick hanging over me.
