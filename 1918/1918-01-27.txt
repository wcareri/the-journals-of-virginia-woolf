### Sunday 27 January

As we were going out we ran flap/slap into Desmond bearing round the corner in an impetuous way. This knocked the bottom from our hope of a solitary evening, but as mercifully as possible. We took a turn in the Old Deer Park. He seemed depressed; lines drawn upon his forehead; he sighs oh dear! oh dear! at intervals, thinking about the war or private difficulties, I suppose. Indeed I thought it unpleasant how one has to steer past certain questions with him: whenâ€™s your book coming out, has Mollyâ€™s novel been taken, are you writing &câ€”I divine that the answers depress him acutely in the early morning. We gave him tea, & discussed the development of psychology since Shakespeareâ€™s day. L. denied this; I asserted it. Desmond thought Othello & Desdemona very simple; but thought we were tolerably represented in fiction. I find myself altogether unmentioned there. Question whether one should write quick events in short scenes, whether fiction should be like life: whether Thackeray has profundity. Desmond has read some of the Newcomes lately: finds no depth, but a charming rippling conventional picturesqueness. So on to Bob (Trevelyan)â€™s poetry: â€œa good commonplace poetâ€, said Desmondâ€”not the kind to bring up discoveries from his own entrails; looks upon the everyday world & finds the right phrase: classicalâ€”& therefore enduringâ€”But I donâ€™t follow this. He brought Enid Bagnold in his pocket, & now, Iâ€™m sure thinks heâ€™s reviewed her himself. Iâ€™m not going to, after a glance at her mind. She led him to describe a Roumanian Prince, whose voice, he said, was the loveliest in London. He rang him up (to account for not coming punctually for dinner) & I listened, & heard a soft hesitating voice stumbling over long words, rather romantic down the telephone. He went off at last, having wrought himself into a state of contentment & garrulity, so that he would have stayed & given the 4th Act of the Irenaid had he been able, & would have been able, had we pressed.
