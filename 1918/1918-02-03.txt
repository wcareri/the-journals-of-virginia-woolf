### Sunday 3 February

Sunday has become as it used to be in Hyde Pk. Gate the social day. The sociability began early for L. at least, Riddell the printer (unidentified) coming, as we hoped to offer a press, but as we discovered only to say that presses arenâ€™t to be had. A female friend was with him. I listened behind the bathroom door. We found Goldie when we came in from our walk; & then Pippa came; curiously untidy, as all Strachey women become at the least provocation. Without a certain degree of good looks it isnâ€™t worth being vainâ€”thats their reasoning, I always suppose. The talk was hampered by the suspicion that she was a jingo: & secondly an older fashioned type then weâ€™re used to. She has the disconcerting though worthy habit of remaining quite silent when she disagrees. She disagreed with me when I said I thought cooperative housekeeping (implying beds) was an improvement on the old style. Goldie shot his direct, well pointed arrows; my only criticism in his case is the feeling which his method produces of being a method. They dig for views too cleverly, these elderly Donsâ€”Stillâ€”stillâ€”Pippa has faded curiously; looks older, & more worn. She spoke of old days of parties, H. B. Smith, George Duckworth, Jack Hills & Christmases at Corby. She thinks that still the way to live; those people so â€œcivilisedâ€ compared with our cropheads. But now she has no time for society; does suffrage, which will turn now into a campaign for equality, by day & night. â€œMercifully, she said, there are people like you who keep out of it. Its most important that there should be people like you. That is so long as youâ€™ve got or earned economic independence. Thats essential. No, Iâ€™m not clever. Iâ€™ve always cared more for people than for ideasâ€”& now I must go. Iâ€™ve got work to do. I mustnâ€™t be lured into sloth here.â€ So she went. It struck me that age consists not in having a different point of view, but in having the same point of view, faded. Goldie shows this too. An evening alone.
