### Friday 12 July

Just back from the Club, & therefore in the restless state most safely to be appeased by writing; reading, though Iâ€™ve Don Juan, the Tragic Comedians, Verrall upon Meredith, Crees upon Meredith, the poems of Heredia & the poems of Laforgue to read, to say nothing of the Autobiography of Tagore, & the life of Macaulay, being out of the question before dinner. Mudies, I confess, sickens me of reading: I feel disinclined even to write, what may become one of these books, so like bales of stuff upon a drapers shelvesâ€”only with out the solid merit of good wool. I stood there with the pallid & respectable & got my allowance. Great storms have been beating over England the last 3 days, the result of the Bishopâ€™s importunity, God being, as usual, spiteful in his concessions, & now threatening to ruin the harvest. I owe God a grudge for his effect upon the Guild.

At the Club we met Lytton by appointment, & had tea downstairs, talking mainly of his book, & his success, & the violent attack upon him by Mrs Ward in the Lit. Sup. yesterday. She sees German brutality in his picture of Nightingale & Clough, professing to let the coarse caricature of Arnold pass. How this lights up the stuffed world of the first class railway carriage that she lives in! Lytton is getting Walter Raleigh to answer, though I think nothing short of a coronet will impress her imagination. He stays this week end with the Dutchess of Marlborough, whom he met in the Cunardsâ€™ box at the opera; & was fresh from Mrs Asquith. Mrs A. is of opinion that the Autobiography of Haydon is superior to the Confessions of Rousseau. She pressed upon him a copy of Hubert Crackanthorpeâ€™s works. He is under no illusion so far about the brilliancy or desirability of this set as familiars, though very happy & comfortable & mellow in his success. Country Life begs him to continue the series in its pages. Lalla Vandervelde is going to act a play of his. His only anxiety is whether fame will continue. Maynard watches eager for him to be converted; but I see no chance, unless pleasure will be his doom: no, I think heâ€™s safe, & really improved, as I suppose most people are by encouragement.

Yesterday & the day before we spent glueing the book, & have now paid all our debts; so that I suppose a great many tongues are now busy with K.M. I myself find a kind of beauty about the story; a little vapourish I admit, & freely watered with some of her cheap realities; but it has the living power, the detached existence of a work of art. I shall be curious to get other opinions. L. rather gloomy now about the prospects of his Review. Thomas has taken his name off the Board, on the ground that the Trade Unions have the same end in view. This is rather cool, as L. gave them the idea. I have bet 1 shilling that all will be settled by Oct. 1st; & L. editor; & the Review in being.
