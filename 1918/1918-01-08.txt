### Tuesday 8 January

As a sign of the times we live in, I note that Fredegond who wants to spend some months in London is advised by her practical friends to live in a hotel. They say that she would have difficulty in getting food, even if she found a servant, or a room to live in. Consequently, she is taking rooms at the Thackeray Hotel.

Some fragments came to mind today which, having nothing to record, I may as well put down. How I went to a Registry Office for Nessa; & noticed that the woman had 6 or 7 pens on her table, tried one after another, found all save one unusable; nibs stuck to the holder with crusts of ink. One night last summer getting down from a bus, I saw a fish bag left on the seat, & gave it to the woman in front of me. She thanked me & said, with half a smirk, â€œThat comes of me not being used to carrying a bagâ€. The bag was evidently the mark of a lower social scale. There were of course other fragments, which at hint of needing them dissolve in my mind. Its odd, considering their triviality, how these little scenes come up again & again at odd moments: are thought of, re-enacted, & disappear. Odd too how one thinks by help of pictures of surroundings. Yesterday I couldnâ€™t remember whether Iâ€™d left a book in my room. And then I saw myself moving my spectacles, & remembered that I moved my spectacles in order to put the book down: sure enough there it was. Iâ€™d give a good deal to know something of psychology. That was one of the books I suggested that Alix should write: but â€œwhats the good if one canâ€™t do it really well?â€ To the Printers (McDermott) today, & find him calmly asserting that he really canâ€™t send the Press on the 14th. Canâ€™t find anyone to move it. This is cool as he took our Â£10 on the understanding we should have the press without fail. However, these chilly half animate overworked little creatures canâ€™t be taken seriously. They donâ€™t attach the same meaning to promises, even written & stamped promises, that we do. People badgering him with small jobs, he said, & hasnâ€™t even the time to claim his money. For the first time for weeks or months I spent a whole afternoon shopping. Coppers accumulate in my purse, parcels hang from every finger; shop people cross; shops crowded: in fact a most disagreeable duty, when done in a mass.
