### Thursday 14 March

If Iâ€™d written this diary last night which I was too excited to do, I should have left a row of question marks at the end. What excited me was the evening paper. After printing all the afternoon I went out later, bought a Star, looked at it casually under the public House lamp, & read that the Prime Minister needed our prayers. We were faced with momentous decisions. We Britons must cling together. In a week or even a few days facts must be faced which would change the British Empire for ever. We evolved from this an offer of peace to France: but it appears to be only L.G.â€™s way of whipping up his gallery. Anyhow, I was whipped. Gerald who was to have dined, rang up to say that a raid was expected, & he must â€œstand byâ€. The night was cloudy, & we werenâ€™t much alarmed, partly because the warning came from official sources.

My dismissal is revoked. A large book on Pepys arrived, which I spent the evening reading, & now another on Swinburne awaits me at the Railway station. Iâ€™m divided whether one likes to have books, or to write fiction without interruption. But I may make a few shillings to pay for my Baskerville. Friday 15 March Happily the weather is turned cloudy; spring blotted out, but one must sacrifice spring to the war. Philip came & we printedâ€”I making rather a mess of the poems, to my annoyance. Philip talked about Blimey who is a shepherd near the Quantocks.
