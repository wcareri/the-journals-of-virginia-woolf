### Saturday 7 December

For some reason, not connected with my virtues I think, I get 2 or even 3 books weekly from the Times, & thus breast one short choppy wave after another. It fills up the time while Night & Day lies dormant; it gives me distinct pleasure I own to formulate rapid views of Henry James & Mr Hergesheimer; chiefly because I slip in some ancient crank of mine. But this sort of writing is always done against time; however much time I may have. For example here I have spent the week (but I was interrupted 2 days, & one cut short by a lunch with Roger) over Hakluyt: who turns out on mature inspection to justify over & over again my youthful discrimination. I write & write; I am rung up & told to stop writing; review must be had on Friday; I typewrite till the messenger from the Times appears; I correct the pages in my bedroom with him sitting over the fire here.

â€œA Christmas number not at all to Mr Richmondâ€™s taste, he said. Very unlike the supplement style.â€  
â€œGift books, I suppose?â€ I suggested.  
â€œO no, Mrs Woolf, its for the advertisers.â€

But to retrace. On Thursday I lunched with Roger in order to hear the following story.

Mrs McColl to Mr Cox of the London Library:  
â€œHave you The Voyage Out by Virginia Woolf?â€  
â€œVirginia Woolf? Let me see; she was a Miss Stephen, daughter of Sir Leslie. Her sister is Mrs Clive Bell I think. Ah, strange to see whatâ€™s become of those two girls. Brought up in such a nice home too. But then, they were never baptised..â€

Roger & I get on very well now; more genuine & free than we were, under the shadow of Gordon Square. We agree on many points; & he, at least, perceives the isolation of our little group in the large hostile world of MacColls & Duckworths. Then we discuss prose; & as usual some book is had out, & I have to read a passage over his shoulder. Theories are fabricated. Pictures stood on chairs. Here I become rather random & desperate. Wolfe brings in a pictureâ€”The question is about a slice of green on the midmost apple. Does it interpose with the violet on the edge of the potato? â€œCut it out: see the way the colours show up over there:â€”well try varnish then.â€ â€œI think its the best thing Iâ€™ve done yet.â€ â€œO yes, thereâ€™s more life in itâ€”its very strong, Wolfe, very strong.â€

At last, inevitably late, I go on to the 17 Club, where Mrs Manus & L. sit in the upper room, correcting proofs, but Couch has only sent a batch. Anyhow, I was too late to help; but not to pour out tea for Miss Matthaie. Why should a woman of her sense apologise all her life long because she is an unattractive woman? She looks up sidelong, like a child who has done wrong. And yet she has more in her head than all the cropheads put together. Alix I found intoning pompously downstairs, with a perverted likeness to a colonel of the upper classes holding forth upon the iniquity of Bolshevism. Her theme is the iniquity of colonels; the method seems much the same; even the voice.

Friday, as I say was spent writing by me; by Leonard in having lunch with Will A.F. & correcting more proofs. No sooner had I done a little type setting, & ruled off the hour & a half before dinner in which to read my distinguished American novelist - Hergesheimer - recommended by Mr Galsworthy, than Lottie admitted Sydney Waterlow. My only hope for passing the time was some sort of introspective confidence on his part; but no such luck. He is prosperous, complacent, self assured even to the extent of confronting the disapproval of Gordon Square unabashed. He is now on the round of his friends, not, he was careful to explain in order to test us, but to enjoy our society. Mary Sheepshanks had been summoned to dine with us in order to discuss the Review, & MacDonaldâ€™s treachery. Paler, perhaps thinner, fading into middle age imperceptibly, with the same flavour of bitterness against a worldâ€”a world of upper class women, it is at the present moment, who ask for an indemnity. Yet, compared with the greater variety of my acquaintance, she comes out abler, better informed, more rational than I remembered her in the days of Fitzroy Square. But still she accepts her â€œnice eveningâ€ as the grudging poor accept a charity which is rather less than they deserve.
