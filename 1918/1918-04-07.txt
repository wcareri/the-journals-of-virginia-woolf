### Sunday 7 April

We are just back from tea with Barbara & Saxon in the Studio. Nick is already moved to another hospital & has written himself, so at least he must be in no immediate danger. Indeed they think he may be home any day now. We had tea; Saxon in his brown woollen vest, stepping fantastically about the room to lay the table; Barbara so evidently nervous that I suppose the child must be a factâ€”but that 4 daysâ€”waiting for news can try anyoneâ€™s nerves. The couple in the interior were almost too perfect an illustration of the post impressionist spirit for my taste. Even the black & white cat seemed decorated by the Omega. White wash in which the hairs of the brush remain, a striped pole, Burnet for the covers, china dogs for the mantelpiece, check cottons wherever you looked, & to the censorious eye one or two uncertainties of taste or reversions to an earlier stage, as for example a bead necklace hanging on a nail. However I came back to think my own room very ugly. The talk was sober, adequate, but not profuse. I donâ€™t think Saxon (who had just washed his head) had anything to say; & his demeanour is a little tart & gritty at the moment. He reminded me of a hen who has laid an eggâ€”but only one. We did not like Hampstead. The vulgarity of Richmond is always a relief afterwards.
