### Saturday 9 March

L. found Unwin very ready to consider the Co-operation book, &, what is more, unqualified in his abuse of Williams, who could, he says, be sued for the damage heâ€™s done to the bookâ€™s prospects. He proposes to issue 2 editionsâ€”one paper, one cloth, at once; after, that is, reading the book which he means to do directly. I daresay Williams will still try to keep his paw upon the manuscript.

We went to a meeting called a â€˜Suffrage Rallyâ€™ in Kingsway this afternoon. It was a very fine afternoon & through a glass door one could see the day lightâ€”a difficult light for speakers to speak down. So prosaic, reasonable, & unconcentrated. The hall was fairly well filled; the audience almost wholly women, as the speakers were too. The pure essence of either sex is a little disheartening. Moreover, whether its a meeting of men or of women, one canâ€™t help wondering why they do it. I get one satisfactory thrill from the sense of multitude; then become disillusioned, finally bored & unable to listen to a word. In truth this meeting seemed to beat the waves in vain. The vote being won, only great eloquence could celebrate the triumph. None were eloquent; & yet they had to beat up a froth. The one who impressed us most was the Russian speaker, who had imagination, & seemed to feel what she said. But at best large indisputable platitudes, finely dressed & balanced, are the only things that can be put into speeches. I watched Mrs Pethick Lawrence rising & falling on her toes, as if half her legs were made of rubber, throwing out her arms, opening her hands, & thought very badly of this form of art.

We had tea at the 17 Club. One room was crowded, & silent; at the end of the other Aldous Huxley & a young woman in grey velvet held what should have been a private conversation. A. has a deliberate & rather dandified way of speaking. All we learned & virtuous people bent over our reforming papers in dead silence; an occasional sentence of the muffled dialogue came out plain from the other end of the room now & then. They were discussing Evan Morgan & his affairs of the heart I think.

We went on to the London Library; & as we walked down the steep street someone came ambling & crouching up to usâ€”Bob. T.â€”laden with an infinitely shabby baggy portmanteauâ€”full of books, I think. So we went on together; & first he confided in L. & then in meâ€”At least he has the air of making a confidence, or asking for one. He wanted to know whether he could add my name to the list of devout Jacobeans. Percy Lubbock & Logan Smith play this very characteristic game, of exquisite interest of course to Bob. Theyâ€™ve counted 20, & Bob was seriously exerting himself to find a 21st. But I refusedâ€”with some vehemence at first, thinking I was to be asked to subscribe to a memorial. Nothing so substantial; only an elderly cultivated game.
