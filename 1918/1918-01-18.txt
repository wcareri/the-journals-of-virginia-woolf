### Friday 18 January

Another skip, partly due to my writing a long letter to Nessa, which drained up some of the things I should have said here. But I like this better than letter writing. Perhaps one should write novels for the 2 of us only. I can remember various doings however: Toynbees & Kot. to dinner on Tuesday (15 January); & that afternoon Lady Strachey read to usâ€”to me for the most part, as L. was late. She read Ben Jonsonâ€™s masques. They are short, & in between she broke off to talk a little, so that it was lighter than before, & I enjoyed it. She told me how she used to read everything at her school; & can remember the books because places are associated with them. At the age of 18 her father gave her leave to read Tom Jones (I think) on condition she never said sheâ€™d read it. Told us that Lyttonâ€™s failure to get a fellowship had been one of the disappointments of her life â€œone of the manyâ€. â€œWell, this next book wonâ€™t be a disappointmentâ€, I said. But she thought the Arnolds would object. Her pride in Lytton & desire to see him a noted literary character very evident. I presumed on this that she was well disposed about Tidmarsh: but as she froze up, & pretended not to know where it was, I suppose thereâ€™s a family rowâ€”Indeed, its easy to see that when fronted by the present sheâ€™s not at her best; conventional, very nervous, thinks theyâ€™re ruined; once get her to the past she has no impediments of the sort, & told stories of beautiful dead Patties & Dalrymples with the greatest animation: how old Pattle shot out of his tank, & thereby killed his wife, who thought him come to life again: how the sailors drank him dry on the voyage to England; how â€œDalâ€ was charming; though not a good man to marry; how Dr Jackson was so handsome & kindâ€”in fact she seems to divide her life into the part of the exciting romantic illuminated play; & the rest of it is merely trudging along the prosaic streets, with nothing to look forward to. Her eyes collapsed; her teeth gone; deaf; but talk of the past or of literatureâ€”& it all lights up again. Literature too must be of the past though. She read us a poem called The Old Way, of a swashing, patriotic kind, & exclaimed how fine it was, & how, as long as we had Hopwood for a poet we neednâ€™t complain. Her patriotism has survived everything else. Patriotism & family feeling, & sights she saw long agoâ€”as for example â€œYou donâ€™t remember I suppose meeting me once on a Bus, when you were 10 or 11? You & Vanessa were with your mother.â€ She has the family gift of fantasy. She ran out to get two little lozenge boxes which she has covered in scraps of coloured paper, preserved from the catalogues of drapers shops. She maynâ€™t read much, or write, & plays patience by herselfâ€”I suppose she ruminates over her past. According to her it was a splendid time to live in. For one thing, she remembers India before the Mutiny. â€œSplendid men they were, the Company servants. Your Prinsep relations among the finest. Fancy my horror when I went to see the Delhi pictures the other day, & found theyâ€™d called the Prinsep Pier the Princes Pier!â€ But talk of womens votes doesnâ€™t move her much.

From this ancient world we came back to one younger, as far as years go, than our own. But the Toynbees arenâ€™t spiritually very young: though surprisingly of our way of thinking (which one takes to be young & advanced still!) as to politics. I rashly took this for granted; & Arnold outdid me in anti-nationalism, anti-patriotism, & anti-militarism. At intervals Kot delivered a formal address upon Russia in broken English. Thereâ€™s a good deal to be said for Kot. He has some likeness to the Russians of literature. He will begin to explain his soul without preface. He explained Katherine (Mansfield)â€™s soul, not at all to her credit. Her lies & poses have proved too much for him, nor does he find more than a slight gift for writing in her. I dont know that this last pleases me however, though it sounds as if I wrote it down for that reason. He is individual in his view of politics, thinks Russia too little civilised to profit by revolution, but here in England its bound to come with immense benefit because weâ€™ve carpets & gas in our poorest houses. Russia scarcely interests him; he never means to go back; prophesies civil war in the spring, & no advantage won by it. In 1905 they were burning houses & stabbing nobles too. Rosalind has merit to look at certainly. I like her better than Arnold, who improves though, & is evidently harmless, & much in his element when discussing Oxford. He hadnâ€™t much good to say of it; they were both sick of it, & will never go back, nor does he think that young men will ever be found to live there again, save as undergraduates. He knew the aristocratic heroes who are now all killed & celebratedâ€”Grenfells, Lister, Shaw Steuart, Asquith, & loathed them; for one reason they must have thought him a pale blooded little animal. But he described their rows & their insolence & their quick snapping brains, always winning scholarships, & bullying & bringing bath chairs full of rats into Chapelâ€”& admitting no one to their set, so that in the end they were almost abolished by the Colonials, who hated them back. It reads much like a Mrs Ward novel.

Wednesday, 16th, I went to the Library, where I met L. who had been on his deputation to the Colonial Office, which was ill-treated by the Secretary; & then to the Club, where we met Alix of course & Fredegond. These two were making painful efforts to set up house together; but neither could do anything decisive, though it was clear that Alix wished to come to terms, as much as she can wish anything. She had been down to Sidmouth, where her Aunt lies paralysed & doomed soon to die. Her eyelid just quivers, & one side of her lip moves; but in medical opinion she neither thinks nor feels. This had not made Alix either gloomier or less gloomy, though I believe she feels it beneath her gentlemanly good sense. As I left, F. beckoned & begged me to decide for her whether she should tell Alix how Gerald wished F. not to share with her, or prevaricate. I always say that people with short hair must be told the truth. I hear this (Saturday) morning that they have an offer of Amberâ€™s house, which they should take, I think, in spite of Gerald.

On Thursday & Friday & Saturday we worked away at printing, so as to have 8 pages set up to print at McDermotts. Unvarying cold & gloom, which turns now to rain, now to snow. This is the Hell of the year. We seem to mark time in the mud. Wright dined with us on Thursday nightâ€”a kindly plausible but long winded man, leaning on L. for support at every point, & giving up his views when they conflicted. They went to see Rowntree together. I have my speculations, but canâ€™t go into them now.
