### Sunday 8 September

At anyrate today I am the wife of an Editor. Leonard got a letter from Bonwick to tell him that he is to get his first number out in January. He wants to know what office accommodation L. will require. It is, I think, a great triumph to have steered through the shoals of MacDonald, Trades Unions, Rowntrees, Bonwicks & all the rest. The idea is very amusing & stimulating too. I like playing with imaginary offices, & sheets of notepaper, & little boys with buttons, & myself walking up the steps to take a cup of tea, & surveying the Strand from the window. Perhaps thereâ€™ll be a shake down bed in the corner. Then Miss Matthaei in her little stall, & long galley proofs: distinguished foreign visitors; telegrams from distant capitals; general importance & glory; everything a solid improving success; yes, a very nice prospect even on its picturesque side, which I admit is the one most perceptible to me. At the same time we had a letter from Hoper offering to let us have Asheham on a yearly tenancy, in case he may ever want the houseâ€”but theres no present prospect of this. We feel fairly safe again. Ka, another letter says, is to be married at 11 tomorrow. I canâ€™t help reading into her letter a sort of protest as to the merits of Will, & her love for him. Yet even so, I own that when I think of her I see her as a rounder warmer more complete person than she was single. I suppose I had got into the habit of seeing her faithful solitary lonely till the end of time; I like happiness too well to be very fastidious about the husband.

What has happened this last weekâ€”following upon the superb success of Brighton? For one thing the weather has been so tremendously generous, giving us after a veil of morning mist, such an endowment of sun & such clouds of alabaster firmly laid against the blue, that even people likeâ€”shall I say Melian Stawell?â€”must have felt jovial & random & unencumbered with high moralities. Or are they always bothering how to share the sunshine? I remember lying on the side of a hollow, waiting for L. to come & mushroom, & seeing a red hare loping up the side & thinking suddenly â€œThis is Earth lifeâ€. I seemed to see how earthy it all was, & I myself an evolved kind of hare; as if a moon-visitor saw me. A good life it is, at such moments; but I canâ€™t recapture the queer impression I had of its being earth life seen from the moon.

Yesterday poor Bunny came for the night, bringing 8 combs of honey, for which he charges 2/6 each. How we were robbed at Brighton! 3/- for a mixture of milk & saccarine. Poor old Bunny! He is as if caked with earth, stiff as a clod; you can almost see the docks & nettles sprouting from his mind; his sentences creak with rust. He can only lay hands on the simplest words. I suppose his vocabulary is now surpassed by Mrs Attfield & equalled by Fred. However, by dint of kindly treatment we softened him; & I must confess that for 20 hours we did very well. We wanted to know about mushrooms; & upon all funguses he is an authority; indeed he discovered one of the smallest for the first time. Then he could tell us about the agricultural labourersâ€™ Union, which is being half secretly organised even among our Freds & Wills. He has a humanity which is not all theoretical, though he will insist upon breaking his brains over possible Labour parties. He talks to the German prisoners, who are social democrats, only fought because they would be shot for refusing, & consider the whole war a device of the artistocracy. Bunny looks forward to a democratic future. I sacrificed half my morning & sat with him hemming handkerchiefs. As an example of his uncouth absurdity which one canâ€™t help liking he described to me a scene with Hope Mirrlees in Paris. He was furiousâ€”the creature is a most enthusiastic friendâ€”because Lawrenceâ€™s novel was reported burnt. Hope was staying in the same hotel. He burst out to her upon the iniquity of burning books. They had never met before. She was so much of his way of thinking that he exclaimed â€œYou darling!â€â€”& offended herâ€”although, as he explained, he was on the far side of the room, & used the word â€˜darlingâ€™ in its other sense. I suppose he never had a rich vocabulary. Anyhow, Hope hinted that he ought to be in the army. Bunny could see nothing wrong or odd in calling a young woman â€œyou darling!â€

â€œVirginia, he said, intimately, I want to ask you to give me a photograph ofâ€”Alix.â€ He had one in mind, which I was forced to give him, to muse over, as I can fancy, by the hour, in his half sentimental simple good hearted way, while he ploughs Mr Hextâ€™s fields with the motor plough. But I was interested by his story of the attempted rescue of Sovercar, an Indian. Bunny appeared like the manly, serious, romantic hero of a Meredith novel.
