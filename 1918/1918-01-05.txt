### Saturday 5 January

We went to Hampton Court, for the first time since we skated there, so I believe. We walked across Bushey Park, & a troop of horses took the opportunity to run from one side to the other. The gilt statue was surrounded by ice, & the ice had an inch of water on it; I broke through with my umbrella.. The beds at Hampton Court are uniformly brown, save for one yellow & one pink flower, primulaâ€™s I think. There were sacks at intervals, which L. thought might be laid down for the gymnastic exercises of Mrs Creighton. We looked in at her windows. As usual we saw nothing but those great vellum folios, containing Italian History, so I suppose. We walked along a raised bank beneath trees to the river; & sat on one of the semi-circle of empty wooden seats. It was cold, but still. Then we took a tram to Kingston & had tea at Atkinsons, where one may have no more than a single bun. Everything is skimped now. Most of the butchers shops are shut; the only open shop was besieged. You canâ€™t buy chocolates, or toffee; flowers cost so much that I have to pick leaves, instead. We have cards for most foods. The only abundant shop windows are the drapers. Other shops parade tins, or cardboard boxes, doubtless empty. (This is an attempt at the concise, historic style.) Suddenly one has come to notice the war everywhere. I suppose there must be some undisturbed pockets of luxury somewhere stillâ€”up in Northumbrian or Cornish farm houses perhaps; but the general table is pretty bare. Papers, however, flourish, & by spending 6d we are supplied with enough to light a weeks fires. A man called Richardson works out a highly complex mathematical method of voting in the trenches.
