### Thursday 6 June

These gaps are accounted for by the weather. Its not weather for drawing up to the fire & settling in. Indeed, I find some difficulty in reading. The windows are both open; the children next door are playing in the garden; the usual song comes from the singing teacherâ€™s room above the laundry; the birds are vocal in the trees. I want to be wandering down grassy spaces. Its impossible to concentrate. Things therefore pass unrecorded. A good deal of sociability goes on in this weatherâ€”Adrian & Karin dined with us on Sunday; she resolutely artistic in a distressing way; bright green, with sturdy embroidery let in. They live rather apart from our world; from all worlds, I cant help feeling, though this may be wrong. A. never troubles himself to see anyone & together they make too dense a block to be good guests at a party. A. was amusing, however. Prejudice leads me to think my own relations rather distinguished. He certainly makes one laugh with his stories of Saxon â€œFifteen minutes it takes him to get from the recumbent to the sitting position.â€ A. is observant, malicious, but more kindly than of old. He has the taste, & she the energy. Iâ€™ve seen Alix tooâ€”indeed asked her back here to dine with me, L. being out. I think the faintest ray of dawn is observable on the pitchy black of her horizon. She is able to conceive the possibility of one day finding some book to read. She has tried Bertieâ€™s mathematics, relinquished it, but did not altogether dismiss my suggestion of legal history. She wants to work at something that matters to no one; & will never be used, seen, or read, & can be done for no more nor less than 3 hours a day.

Then Carrington came to tea with me, L. making a speech again, (his activities are beyond counting nowâ€”what with League of Nations & all its evil designs. War & Peace, & its possibilities, to which one must add the persistent darkies, & the 17 Club committee). Carrington stayed over 2 hours; & I think that by itself is a sign of youth. She is odd from her mixture of impulse & self consciousness. I wonder sometimes what sheâ€™s at: so eager to please, conciliatory, restless, & active. I suppose the tug of Lyttonâ€™s influence deranges her spiritual balance a good deal. She has still an immense strange admiration for him & us. How far it is discriminating I donâ€™t know. She looks at a picture as an artist looks at it; she has taken over the Strachey valuation of people & art; but she is such a bustling eager creature, so red & solid, & at the same time inquisitive, that one canâ€™t help liking her. She posted me up in all the gossip. Jos has married his deaf governess, & thereby blasted the hopes of Heaven knows how many Marjories. She is dismissed in the harshest way, humiliated in the face of all her friendsâ€”or so I should feel it. Lytton complains that the critics havenâ€™t attacked his judgments. They have copied each other & complimented him without much fineness. Still his book goes into another edition; the praise from the elderly, the Ottolines & the Goldies, is lavish. I havenâ€™t yet read it through; indeed, Iâ€™ve rather shirked formulating my own opinion, expecting to find it rather complicated. At any rate, as Iâ€™m on the verge of cooking dinner & going up to hear the Magic Flute I shanâ€™t begin now. And Oliver has taken a new mistress, & Barbara & Saxon have left Asheham, & I can think of no more gossip for the time being.
