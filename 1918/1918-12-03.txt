### Tuesday 3 December

(What odd stray of knowledge makes me think that this is Carlyleâ€™s birthday? Perhaps because Iâ€™m reading about Froude;â€”I go on to wonder whether any one else is thinking of Carlyleâ€™s birthday, & if so whether it gives him any pleasure; & again of the curious superstition, haunting literary people, of the value of being remembered by posterityâ€”but I had better rein myself in).

I have to read for a second time Murryâ€™s poem, which I found hard to read; from reasons the opposite of those that make Eliot hard to read: Murry has a plethora of words; his poem is intricate & involved & as thick as a briar hedge; he does his thinking aloud; not making you fetch it from the depths of silence as Eliot does. Weâ€™ve been walking by the river, & indeed sitting beside it, so hot it is, bland, milky, & without thrill in the air. The gulls were letting themselves be carried down stream, for a diversion I suppose; little companies of three & four gliding down, & then one dives & reappears. We discussed the origin of my present fit of melancholy, & I was divinely reassured by L. so that here I sit comfortable & secure; once more established in that degree of belief which makes life possible. But I leave out the analysis, which I have gone into sufficiently. I fancy all people have these spiritual tides in themâ€”Heaven knows why. Altogether the more one thinks of it the stranger oneâ€™s own organisation appears.

On Sunday, that is the 1st December we had a dinner party. Six people make a dinner party. They destroy private conversation. You have to be festive. We had Nick, Carrington, Mrs Manus & Sanger: & I think it was a successful party. We were sufficiently springy & spontaneous I think. Charlie made his little jokes. Nick was nearly silent, but appreciative. I foresee a testy middle age for Nick. Mrs Manus enjoyed her dinner. Carrington has more merit than most of the young. We had chairs down and abolished the sofa. I canâ€™t for the life of me remember what we talked about, save that Charlie emphatically despised both Herbert Fisher & Gilbert Murray. He doesnâ€™t like to be asked to meet people because theyâ€™re interesting he said. I said no, you only like failures. On Monday I went first to Harrisonâ€™s with L. then walked across Regentâ€™s Park & had tea with Barbara. Regentâ€™s Park at 4.30 on a December afternoon is a dreary place. So many purple leaves seem to be flattened on the path. Then the park keepers begin whistling, & I remember being afraid of being shut in, as a child. Then the mist rolls up over that vast open space. On one side of you the commoner animals in the zoo grunt & growlâ€”chiefly pigs now, for war purposes I suppose. This did not produce a cheerful frame of mind in which to visit an invalid; & to my horror I found that she shares a room with another, a widow, whose husband was killed; & there poor woman, she sat, pretending to read a book & not to look my way, while Barbara & I gossiped, without much spirit. B. would have preferred a son; sons, she says, are more troublesome, nervous, naughty, from birth; I suppose this is the natural feeling, though not a very desirable one; assertiveness seems to her interesting. Her own baby, with Nickâ€™s nose, slept in a cradle; grumbling a little, but very good she said. The future seemed to oppress her.
