### Monday 11 March

I spent 7/ on books this afternoon; a fact to be recorded, since its the only mention of buying books this year, or last, perhaps. As a matter of fact Iâ€™ve accumulated 12/ as Times money; add 5/ for a birthday present, & I have 17/â€”an unparalleled gain. First, however, I beat the town for chocolate or sweets. In the whole of the stores, not one ounce of choc, to be had; but some simple square drops, such as one used to buy in a bag for a penny. Half a crown will now buy a pound of them. Half a crown in old days would have bought a coal-scuttle full. Then I went on the top of a bus, for the day was of the quality of June, only fresher, & sadder too, to Nuttâ€™s shop to get a Leopardi; then to Mudies where I bought Mill on Liberty; then to the Charing Cross Road where I bought the Happy Hypocrite, by Max Beerbohm; & Exiles of the Snow, by Lancelot Hogben. In this way I laid out 7/. But I was amused to find that the lust after books revives with the least encouragement. I want a copy of Congreve. I could have had one containing all the plays I shall ever read for 2/6 I daresay; but this demon suggested that I might enquire for the Baskerville in two volumes. The bookseller shared my lust which increased it; in short I told him to make enquiries. He would not commit himself to name any probable price, from which I judge that he is calculating on the lust to possess it when I see it. And, after all, nothing gives back more for oneâ€™s money than a beautiful bookâ€”obviously Iâ€™m slipping. I sauntered round his shelves, as I had done in most of the shops. He is careful, select, bookish; no bargains but the type of book one might like to buy. These bookshops have an air of the 18th century. People drop in & gossip about literature with the shopkeeper who, in this case, knew as much about books as they did. I overheard a long conversation with a parson, who had discovered a shop in Paddington full of Elzevirs. He denounced the government, particularly for its waste of paper. They should abolish all newspapers, & stick a sheet in the p. office, if there happened to be any news.

So to the Club, where I found L. Fredegond, Gerald (Shove), Goldie, Brailsford, & Alix. The poet Hogben was also there. I laid his little book on the arm of my chair. Gossip of the usual kind. Poor Hogbenâ€™s book is precisely the dreary imitative stuff one might have expected; or even worse than one might have expectedâ€”what Lytton would call â€œilliterateâ€; under the influence of Swinburne, incredibly ungifted, & weakly rebellious.

Home. L. to a L. of N. meeting.
