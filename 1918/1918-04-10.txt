### Wednesday 10 April

A very wet dark day. Printed. I set up one page in 1 hour & 15 minutesâ€”my record. At this rate, the book might be done in a month. I had a letter from Miss Harriet Weaver yesterday asking whether we would consider printing Joyceâ€™s new novel, which no other printer will do, owing presumably to its sentiments. They must be very warm, considering the success he had with his last. She is to come here, though we can hardly tackle a book. I like this dipping into the great bran pie. By the way, Iâ€™m rejected by The Times once more; & thus reel off my book at a great pace, & I suppose books will flood in all in a heap one of these days. To the printer, who has almost set up his new machine, but without power & without a compositor we are still far from getting our rights.
