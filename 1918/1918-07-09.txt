### Tuesday 9 July

I cant fill up the lost days, though it is safe to attribute much space in them to printing. The title page was finally done on Sunday. Now Iâ€™m in the fury of folding & stapling, so as to have all ready for glueing & sending out tomorrow & Thursday. By rights these processes should be dull; but its always possible to devise some little skill or economy, & the pleasure of profiting by them keeps one content. Yesterday we had a day off, & went, together for a wonder, to Souhamiâ€™s; & I hereby make a vow to buy all draperies, covers, cloths, rugs from him in future and never again go near the Omega or the Burnetâ€™s. We have obliterated that painful staring check under a pale green & blue persian clothâ€”infinitely preferable. L. up in London seeing Bonwick about the dummy copy, & at 17 Club meeting. An Indian is now established in that institution perpetually playing chess. Saxon, by the way dined with us on Saturday, & supplemented this dinner by a long unnecessary intimate discussion of his feelings & health on the telephone. He doesnâ€™t get on with Nick, he says, though Barbara manages all right. I believe he takes natural pleasure in feeling himself preferred in spite of the awkwardnesses. Now to my stapling.
