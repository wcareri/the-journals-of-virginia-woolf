### Tuesday 3 September

Pernel came on Saturday; & her coming was to have coincided precisely with the Stephensâ€™ going; but there was a hitch here; as the fly refused to take them, & thus we enjoyed another meal with Karin. I regret to say though that either natureâ€™s protests or our mute ones have diminished her appetite, so that she was no longer a show piece for a visitor. She announced her intention of being wheeled to Charleston on Adrianâ€™s bicycle; which considering her shortness, breadth & great pillar like legs, produced a comic picture, & so I think Adrian judged it, for he dissuaded her from mounting till they were at the bottom of the drive.

I think the best way to sum up the impression of Pernel is to quote our simultaneous exclamation on going to bed on Saturday night â€œWhat a relief to talk to a human being!â€ Part of the relief, of course, is the effect of her good ears; but beyond this she is subâ tâ le, finely graded, with fine shades of understanding & perception which are not, after all, entirely a matter of ears. I suppose if Karin were witness in her own behalf she might point to a certain faintness, remoteness, & donnishness in Pernel; she does perhaps survey life through a tinted shade, but her eyes are good ones, & she is too sensible, humorous, & indolent to have taken the shape of a professor, or indeed to believe very heartily in Newnham or education or anything but books & ideas & poetry & so on. A more unambitious person does not live; but she has not the dulness & flatness which generally exist in these self effacing unselfish old maids. I wonder what we talked about? Partly about Hope Mirrlees, whom weâ€™ve asked to write us a story; & Jane, & Lady Strachey, & writing novels, & food. Last night, L. read Hardyâ€™s poems aloud. The night before we discussed complexes. Then it turned out that she had been to a lecture upon potato blight. I should never be surprised to find that she knows everything about Turbines or Bees: everything that can be learnt from books that is. She lacks the ambition, perhaps the power, to handle the things themselves. Here Karin again has a plea to be considered. I suppose she has done more things than Pernel. The weather was very windy, but the mushrooms have come again. She was rather unable to see them; & I suspect she mooned rather than looked about her. She always arrives here provided with two shilling books with bright covers one to read coming, the other going. During the week end she always reads one classic & one nonsense biography, such as Lady Jeune. I suppose however that she is in her quiet dreamy way obstinately conscientious, & something of a martinet towards herself.

â€œNothing would ever induce me to marryâ€ she said, with the utmost conviction. Indeed I should fancy that her bachelor life, with many women friends, & a great many books, & lectures to prepare on French literature suit her perfectly.

This is written on the return from our great Brighton treat. Everything succeeded. L. foretold a wet day by the light on our shutters, but on opening them we found a perfect September morning. The sun is thinner but very clear, & the air sparkling, now that we are past August. The colours are being burnished on the trees too. The shadows seem lighter & paler. No one could confuse the 3rd of September with the 31st August. A perfect treat must include a visit to the 2nd hand bookshops. (I bought the life of Col. Hutchinson); sweets (we found chocolate unlimited) lunch at Muttonâ€™s; the band on the pier; some human grotesques; tea at Boothâ€™s; Buns at Cowleyâ€™s; a trail past shops with many temptations to buy, for the most part resisted; & a debauch at some stationer; & so home, to find the downs & this house lovelier than ever. All these things we did; & we had too a feeling of lightness because of the villages won in France. Queant & Lens are taken, as we learnt from a shop window. Canâ€™t one see the curtain lifting, very slightly, & some promise of a world of food & so on beyond? I couldnâ€™t help thinking that the sight of an English gentleman walking the stubble after partridges with his sons & his retriever was a foretaste of better days.
