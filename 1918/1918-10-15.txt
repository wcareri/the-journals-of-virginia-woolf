### Tuesday 15 October

I did not think I should so soon have to describe a meeting with a cabinet ministerâ€”though I admit that we seem to be drifting, without much desire on our part, into a circle where the great officials are sometime to be found. This is the doing of the (International) Review, mainly; but Herbert Fisherâ€™s visit wasnâ€™t due to the Review; it was very obviously due to old family affection. I was sitting down alone to tea on Sunday with my odious penny paper to read (the Germans having agreed to evacuate late on Saturday night) L. being gone to Sutton to speak about our colonies & the servants out, when the bell rang & I saw several figures against the glass. On opening the door I really couldnâ€™t at first collect my wits; there were Olive & M. Heseltine & Herbert Fisher. The Hâ€™s. went off, & Herbert came in, as they had arranged beforehand. Was I nervous or proud, or anything but interested & anxious to pick his brains for news? I donâ€™t think I felt a moments agitation. For one thing he has lost his lean intellectual look; his hollow cheeks are filled; his eyes with that pale frosty look which blue eyes get in age; his whole bearing very quiet, simple, & when not speaking rather saddened & subdued. The number of deaths in his house caused this perhaps; but I canâ€™t help thinking that London life has rid him of his desire to say clever things to undergraduates all the time. Anyhow we talked without stopping & without difficulty.

â€œWeâ€™ve won the war todayâ€ he said, at once. â€œI saw Milner this morning, & he says we shall have peace by Christmas. The Germans have made up their minds they canâ€™t fight a retreat. The General staff has faced the fact, & theyâ€™ve had what I think the considerable courage to admit it. Of course we canâ€™t accept their present terms. Why, that would leave them still the greatest military power in Europe. They could begin again in ten years time. But it rests with the French. Lloyd George is going to Paris on Monday; but they are holding out for the evacuation of Alsace Lorraine as a guarantee. We shall probably demand the disarmament of certain regiments too. But weâ€™ve won the war.â€

He then told me how weâ€™d won the war, which was, according to him, by taking a tremendous risk some time in July & leaving the English line held without reserves, & withdrawing the army to reinforce Foch in his blow, which was timed with French precision 10 minutes before the German attack. If it had failed there was nothing between the Germans & the Channel ports. There is now a good prospect of a complete defeat of the German army; Foch says â€œI have not yet had my battleâ€. Despite the extreme vindictiveness of our press & the French press, Herbert believed that we are going to baulk Foch of his battle, partly because the Germans will accept any terms to avoid it. â€œLloyd George has told me again & again that he means to be generous to the Germans. â€œWe want a strong Germanyâ€, he says. The Kaiser will probably go. O I was a great admirer of the Germans in the beginning. I was educated there, & Iâ€™ve many friends there, but Iâ€™ve lost my belief in them. The proportion of brutes is greater with them than with us. Theyâ€™ve been taught to be brutal. But it hasnâ€™t paid. Each one of their crimes has turned out badly. No one can face another war. Why in 10 years they could blot out London by their aeroplanes. It cost us Â£1,000 to kill a German at the battle of the Somme (1916); now it costs us Â£3,000. But the proportion of men who have never been hurt, or even seen anything horrible is very large. Seeley told me the other day that heâ€™d spoken to thousands & thousands of soldiers, & they all wanted the war conditions of life to go on â€œwithout these bloody shells.â€ Thereâ€™ll be trouble when they come back. Theyâ€™ll find their old lives too dull. Iâ€™m going to educate them, its true; but that wonâ€™t begin yetâ€”not in my time. I want to reform the Universities next, & then I shall have done. I canâ€™t stay in Parliament without office. Very likely I shall go back to Oxford to teach.â€

So we talked on, not altogether like a Mrs Humphry Ward novel. I tried to think it extraordinary but I found it difficultâ€”extraordinary, I mean, to be in touch with one who was in the very centre of the very centre, sitting in a little room at Downing St. where, as he said, the wireless messages are racing through from all over the world, a million miles a minute; where you have constantly to settle off hand questions of enormous difficulty & importanceâ€”where the fate of armies does more or less hang upon what two or three elderly gentlemen decide. Herbert thinks there are 2 or 3 geniuses in the cabinet (L. George, Balfour, & possibly Winston Churchillâ€”his definition being that they make everything appear different) & a number of mediocrities. His qualities I suppose are balance & foresight & culture. Importance seems to smooth away surface eccentricities; to give people an appearance of simplicity; they are very courteous; but somehow no longer spontaneous people; the taint of the family butler is on them. But this was more visible when L. came in. Alone with me H. was very friendly & quiet; & gave himself no airs of dignity.
