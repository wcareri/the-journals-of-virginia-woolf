### Friday 3 May

L. to London to see Henderson. In course of seeing Henderson he saw all the celebrities of the day. Webbs, Goldie & so on. I went to a Registry Office in the Kingâ s Rd. to get a servant for Nessa. The woman true Chelsea; marked as China is, by her dress, manner, & refinement. She has a servant, which is more to the point. On then, by Bus & tube to Hampstead, & to tea with Margaret. I almost mistook Lilian semirecumbent upon a green pillow for a Persian cat. Janet was there in those decorous purple draperies with which people compromise between art & fashion in Hampstead. Margaret immensely fat & broad; all black; she had stood two photographs of Ottoline opposite my plate. I felt this to be the heart of the womanâ€™s republic. L. came in, & we had a long semi-political argument arising out of Milk combines, about government. Margaretâ€™s carpet is there to give an air of austerity to the room.

â€œAh yes, my lifes a compromiseâ€”all a compromiseâ€ she said. I was struck as usual, by her genuine character, & also by the unadorned sense of Lilian, always to the point, & surprisingly ready with her views, considering her air of modesty. As a matter of fact I believe she comes at things better than most women, being entirely unencumbered by any vanity; as she may well be; in clothing, manner, appearance, she is of the most ordinary type possible; & thus her talk, & her pipe, come with force. Janet shows signs of real old age; acquiescent; not blunted, so much as increasingly meditativeâ€”shakes her head a little. But she looked very well.
