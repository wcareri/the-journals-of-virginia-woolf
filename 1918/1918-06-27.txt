### Thursday 27 June

The echoes of the great Charleston affair may still be heard, especially in the region of the kitchen. But it will be needless I hope to take action on their account any more; I wasted Tuesday afternoon writing first a violent & then a pacific letter to Nessa with my version of our Virtue & Trissieâ€™s baseness. L. took proofs meanwhile. The Labour Congress of course makes it impossible to bring that book to a close. L. was there all day yesterday, & had the sensation of Kerenskyâ€™s surprise visit. I still find it difficult to make head or tail of Labour party politics, or indeed of any other; but with practice I suppose it wouldnâ€™t be harder than reviewing Mr Merrick. The interest in politics thrives among our friends just now. Adrian & Karin have become rebels & extremists & are seen in every gallery & meeting place. L. had to repeat the whole story twice over after dinner, first for Margaret & then for Bella. Bella is anti-Bolshevik; but the significant thing is that everyone takes some side or other. Everyone makes the state of the country his private affair.

Mrs Woolf & Herbert dined with us on Tuesday. She has, I think, the qualities of a person who has never altogether grown up, in spite of 9 children & all her cares. She gossips & enjoys herself & bursts into tears because she feels she ought to burst into tears; but she tells her memories with spirit, & somehow deals with life very freely & easily & with the liveliest, childlike interest in it all, mixed with the most absurd conventions. She chattered away about her first marriage, & how theyâ€™d travelled in Austria, & how sheâ€™d had a set of sables, & bought her trousseau at Swan & Edgars. â€œBut Rasselas says the truthâ€”a very fine truthâ€ she observed. â€œHappiness is never perfectâ€”Iâ€™ve never found perfect happinessâ€”always something missing, Virginia,â€ & there she was taking back a bunch of cornflowers to Bella because it was the anniversary of Dickâ€™s death. Herbert cordial, distant, & detached as usual.

At the Club yesterday I picked up the Times & read of Aunt Minnaâ€™s death 2 days ago at Lane End. She is buried there today. She was in her 91st year. A more composed, & outwardly useless life one canâ€™t imagine. She merely lived all that length of time, without adventures, sorrows, difficulties, doubts, actions. She was always unperturbed. I think her great quality was her good sense. She was never in any way absurd or tiresome, & if necessary she would have been a person to ask some sorts of advice from. I saw her a few weeks ago, apparently unaware of death, taking her house for 4 years further, & saying precisely what sheâ€™d said any timeâ€”about good & bad novels, about George & Margaret & how Dalingridge wasnâ€™t really good country, but of course one mustnâ€™t say so. An elderly toady was with her, who had been a great beauty once, & was still fine looking, & a kind woman, according to Aunt Minna. I expect that the poor old lady was more stoical than she let on: certainly she never seemed selfish or callous; always had her own small affairs which gave her just as much interest as she wanted, & she was too level headed, too clear sighted to pretend for a second to feel more than she did or to ask for expressions of feeling. Gerald I think she was fondest of; his change of mood troubled her a good deal. She was very proud of George & Margaret. She thought it necessary to tell me that at her age she couldnâ€™t ride a bicycle. I believe too much money had always kept her more at a distance from life than was good for her. She was a great supporter of the Duckworth family, & dies the last of them all.
