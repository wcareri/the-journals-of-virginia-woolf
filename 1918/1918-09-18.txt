### Wednesday 18 September

I have let the first freshness of the Webbs fade from my mirror; but let me bethink me of another metaphor which they imposed upon me, towards the end of Sunday. I was exalted above a waste of almost waveless sea, palish grey, & dented with darker shadows for the small irregularities, the little ripples which represented character & life love & genius & happiness. But â€œIâ€ was not exalted; â€œIâ€ was practically non-existent. This was the result of a talk with Mrs Webb. In truth though they deserve more careful handling. I wonder how I can recapture the curious discomfort of soul which Mrs Webb produces each time I see her again? In the intervals one forgets; in a second it comes over one again. Thereâ€™s something absolutely unadorned & impersonal about her. She makes one feel insignificant, & a little out of key. She represses warmth or personality. She has no welcome for oneâ€™s individuality. She divines a little what oneâ€™s natural proclivities are, & she irradiates them with her bright electric torch.

It was a pouring wet day, on Saturday; not a day for geniality. Webb however has some coat to shake; she is as bare as a bone. We sat down to tea, without George Young. They eat quickly & efficiently & leave me with hunks of cake on my hands. After tea we were soon disposing of our topics, & I began to feel nervous, lest our cupboards should be bare. Then G. Young appeared, having like all Youngs, rejoiced in his battle with distance & wet. Liked the walk, he said. While he changed Mrs Webb rapidly gave me her reasons for saying that she had never met a great man, or woman either. At most, she said, they possessed remarkable single qualities, but looked at as a whole there was no greatness in them. Shakespeare she did not appreciate, because a sister, who was a foolish woman, always quoted him wrong to her as a child. Goethe might conceivably have been a great man. Then, this having been dealt with, down came L. & G. Young & they all pounced together upon some spot of interest floating far out beyond my ken. I think it was to do with the General Election & the views of the private soldiers. Young came provided with facts, but I rather think these did not stand much investigation. He is a slow, stiff, kindly man, with all Hiltonâ€™s romance, but less than Hiltonâ€™s brain; & through following his ideals he has left the diplomatic service, & is now a marine officer at Portsmouth. After dinner Mrs Webb plunged from brisk argument to unconcealed snoring. Then Sidney had his turn. I thought he spoke a little quick to conceal the snores, but you have only to ask him a question & he can go on informing you till you can hold no more. He sketched his idea of a Supernational authority, & the future of Bills of Exchange. The work of Government will be enormously increased in the future. I asked whether I should ever have a finger in the pie? â€œO yes; you will have some small office no doubt. My wife & I always say that a Railway Guard is the most enviable of men. He has authority, & he is responsible to a government. That should be the state of each one of us.â€

And then we discussed L.â€™s plan of a state so contrived that each person has to do some work. Here there was a long argument upon the growing distance between men of different social grades & professions, Young affirming it, the Webbs denying it. I asked (in reporting conversations oneâ€™s own sayings stand out like lighthouses) one of my most fruitful questions; viz: how easy is it for a man to change his social grade? This brought down a whole shower bath of information, but let us say that the Webbsâ€™ shower baths are made of soda water. They never sink one, or satiate. Webb told us how many scholarships were won in London in a given year, & also reported upon the educational system of E. Sussex, which bad though it is, is slightly better than that of W. Sussex. â€œI myselfâ€ he said â€œcame too early to profit by secondary education. My parents were lower middle class shopkeepers, possessed, like so many of their kind, with a blind determination to educate their sons somehow, but without a ghost of a notion how to set about it. They hit on the plan of sending me & my brother abroad to France & Germany; & so we learnt French & German at least. I can still read them, though I seldom do.â€ Our talk must have dealt fully with education, for I remember that Mrs Webb woke with a start & delivered herself of a statement upon the German â€˜wrong turningâ€™, & put Young right on some point about the division of character & intellect. He was simple enough to separate them & to prefer what he was quite unable to define. She thrust him through & through with her rapier, but he persisted.

Next day, which was said to begin for the W.â€™s at 5.30, when they begin tea-drinking in their bedrooms, I had to withdraw in order to do battle with a very obstinate review of Wellsâ€™ â€˜Joan & Peterâ€™. My ideas were struck stiff by the tap of Mrs W.s foot, up & down the terrace, & the sound of her rather high, a rather mocking voice, discoursing to L. while she waited either for W. to come or the rain to stop. They walked on the downs, till lunch. I must now skip a great deal of conversation & let us suppose that Sidney & Beatrice & I are sitting on the road side overlooking Telscombe, smoking cigarettes, in bright sunshine, while the Silver Queen slowly patrols above Newhaven. The downs were at their best; & set Mrs W. off upon landscape beauty, & recollections of India, which she turns to when lying awake at night, relishing the recollection more than the reality. Sidney, one perceives, has no organ of sight whatever, & pretends to none. Mrs W. has a compartment devoted to nature. So briskly narrating their travels & impressions, which were without respect for British rule, we set off home. I saw them from behind, a shabby homely, dowdy couple, marching with the uncertain step of strength just beginning to fail, she clutching his arm, & looking much older than he, in her angularity. They were like pictures in French papers of English tourists, only wanting spectacles & Baâ eâ dekers to finish them. Their clothes looked ill dusted, & their eyes peering in front of them. My few private words came, as I knew they would come, when Mrs W. detached us two together, passing Southease Church. She asked me about my novel, & I supplied her with a carefully arranged plot. I wished, so at least I said, to discover what aims drive people on, & whether these are illusory or not. She promptly shot forth: â€œTwo aims have governed my life; one is the passion for investigation by scientific means; the other the passion for producing a certain good state of society by those investigations.â€ Somehow she proceeded to warn me against the dissipation of energy in emotional friendship. One should have only one great personal relationship in oneâ€™s life, she said; or at most twoâ€”marriage & parenthood. Marriage was necessary as a waste pipe for emotion, as security in old age when personal attractiveness fails, & as a help to work. We were entangled at the gates of the level crossing when she remarked, â€œYes, I daresay an old family servant would do as well.â€ On the way up the hill she stated her position that one should wish well to all the world, but discriminate no one. According to her the differences are not great; the defects invariable; one must cultivate impersonality above all things. In old age people become of little account, she said; one speculates chiefly upon the possibility, or the impossibility of a future life. This grey view depressed me more & more; partly I suppose from the egotistical sense of my own nothingness in her field of vision. And then we wound up with a light political gossip & chapter of reminiscences, in which Mr & Mrs Webb did their parts equally. & so to bed; & to my horror, in came Mrs W. early next morning to say Goodbye, & perched in all her long impersonality on the edge of my bed, looking past my stockings drawers & po. This has taken so long to write that we are now arrived at
