### Monday 7 October

I infinitely regret my generous impulse to write a letter describing the Webbs to Margaret; that evening my mind was full of ideas; & Asheham deserved some richer farewell than I am able to give it, disturbed as I am by the briskness of homecoming, & a little agitated by the servant problem that I have to face tomorrow. I am inclined to dwell upon the warmth & beauty of this room. I have bought another glass jar for 2/-. These things are in the foreground. It is partly due to them & partly to the dampness of the Harmsworth press that I donâ€™t write first & foremost of the German offer of peace. Certainly it made our hearts jump at Asheham this morning. But as the Times insists upon minimising it, not much exhilaration remains.

We came up by East Grinstead to avoid the crowd, a long journey therefore, stopping at all the dullest places in Sussexâ€”West Hoathly among others. We lunched at Valcheras, & there looked into the lowest pit of human nature; saw flesh still unmoulded to the shape of humanityâ€”Whether it is the act of eating & drinking that degrades, or whether people who lunch at restaurants are naturally degraded, certainly one can hardly face oneâ€™s own humanity afterwards.
