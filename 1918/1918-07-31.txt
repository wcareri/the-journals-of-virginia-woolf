### Wednesday 31 July

Arrived at Asheham. I sit as if in the open airâ€”the drawing room providing only a shell of shade in the intense heat. The air dances over the field; & the smoke of the farm on the meadows mixes with the haze. The garden is overgrown, & the flowers crushed out. However, at this moment L. is cutting our beans for dinner.

We spent yesterday doing jobs in London. I saw a dead horse on the pavementâ€”a literal case of what politicians call dying in harness, & rather pathetic to meâ€”to die in Oxford Street one hot afternoon, & to have been only a van horse; & by the time I passed back again he was removed. This shows what my business was. Mudies. The Club. I loitered past jewellers windows looking for a stone to replace my sapphire lost in the train going to Garsington. Pale cracked emeralds of doubtful value tempt me greatly. Lytton & Alix at the Clubâ€”the last scene of that familiar drama. Lytton was on his way to catch a train. Alix, I suppose, never catches them. Terrible though it is to think of, she is sitting in the 17 Club at this momentâ€”a kind of Fate, surveying the passage of moral generations. Lytton had lunch with Lord Dâ€™Abernon together with Lord Ribblesdale & a vulgar appreciative little manager, who asked to read his Chinese play & gave hopes of producing it. Lytton affects to think poorly of it. Iâ€™ve forgotten what I think. I complimented him on the change in Carringtonâ€”he has improved her. â€œAh, but the future is very darkâ€”I must be free. I shall want to go off.â€ I suggested that she might follow suit, which did not perhaps quite please him. In the street we passed Oliver & the flashing Inez; & were then stopped by Kot. who wanted us to come & meet D. H. Lawrenceâ€”or perhaps to ask him here. Kotâ€™s blood shot eyes, & general sordidity struck us, in the middle of St James Square. He is a mysterious figureâ€”not only in his occupations, but in his desire to be a friend of ours, though he seems without many friends. Anyhow, he was the last person we saw in London, since Mr Cox of the London Library doesnâ€™t count.

Today the servants were off by a 7 oâ€™clock train; & we came by Clapham, & meant to go by East Grinstead, but found places in the Lewes train after all, & got to Glynde about 2.30â€”not a bad journey. Everyone congratulated themselves on finding room at all, after the rumours about crowds that have been put about. In my carriage we were â€œa family partyâ€, according to the extremely capable, friendly dogmatic Jew business man who took us in charge. These are queer meetings; so impressed on one at the time; then so rubbed out. Already Iâ€™ve half forgotten the soldier with the nickel knee plate & the metal arch to his foot, though he talked at the top of his voice, & boasted, & made me hate him; & I have forgotten the women with children, who drank a few drops of whiskey, & how we were all offered drinks of tea, & bites of sandwichesâ€”& were helpful & kindly & on our best manly & womanly behaviour. We ate our lunch under some trees coming from Glynde.
