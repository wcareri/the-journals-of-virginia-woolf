### Thursday 18 April

There is a grave defect in the scheme of this book which decrees that it must be written after tea. When people come to tea I cant say to them, â€œNow wait a minute while I write an account of youâ€. They go, & its too late to begin. And thus, at the very time that Iâ€™m brewing thoughts & descriptions meant for this page I have the heartbreaking sensation that the page isnâ€™t there; theyâ€™re spilt upon the floor. Indeed its difficult to mop them up again. And at this moment the mere length of my list of unrecorded visitors frights me from beginning. Judge Wadhams, Hamilton Holt, Harriet Weaver, Ka, Roger, Nessa, Maynard, Shepherd, Goldie, not to mention the Guild & Alix & Bryn & Noel, (who may be called the 17 Club:) all these have accumulated since Sunday; & each deserves something to mark their place, & I did mark it at the time. But how recover the impression of Wadhams & Holt? It was a tremendously successful visit (on Sunday 14 April). We had prepared ourselves most accurately. They made speeches & looked at the pictures & complimented L. all according to forecast. They were impressive to me in the first place for their vivacity which combined with their large well nourished bodies made them appear powerful; next because they treated me with respect; & then because they were simply & intensely in love with the League of Nations. Judge Wadhams had â€œspottedâ€ every minister in America. They were in touch with every group of people in the world, as far as I could gather, with an army of stenographers who send out pamphlets with the personal touch wherever a pamphlet can lodge. Compared with this our record is tame. â€œWe put you right on the top, Mr Woolf, of the constructive thinkers of the warâ€”I can see your place on my shelves at this momentâ€”â€¦ Pardon me, you have used the word â€œsocialâ€ more than once. I dont rightly understand what you mean by itâ€¦.â€ We both explained for 10 minutes. â€œNo; I donâ€™t understand.â€ â€œWell we must proceed to the Sidney Webbs; but weâ€™ve done no more than scratch your surface Mr Woolf, & we must try to do more next timeâ€”With thanks to you, Mrs Woolf, for letting us see your homeâ€”â€ & off they went.

But almost instantly Harriet Weaver appeared. Here our predictions were entirely at fault. I did my best to make her reveal herself, in spite of her appearance, all that the Editress of the Egoist ought to be, hut she remained inalterably modest judicious & decorous. Her neat mauve suit fitted both soul & body; her grey gloves laid straight by her plate symbolised domestic rectitude; her table manners were those of a well bred hen. We could get no talk to go. Possibly the poor woman was impeded by her sense that what she had in the brownpaper parcel was quite out of keeping with her own contents. But then how did she ever come in contact with Joyce & the rest? Why does their filth seek exit from her mouth? Heaven knows. She is incompetent from the business point of view & was uncertain what arrangements to make. We both looked at the MS. which seems to be an attempt to push the bounds of expression further on, but still all in the same direction. And so she went. And Ka came & was made to drink castor oil out of an egg cup, & lay on a sofa, & was nearly sick, & had a disturbed night & was better next morning.

Then I went to Guildford. I donâ€™t see how to put 3 or 4 hours of Rogerâ€™s conversation into the rest of this page; (& I must stop & read Viola Meynell) it was about all manner of things; on growing old; on loneliness; on religion; on morality; on Nessa; on Duncan; on French literature; on education; on Jews; on marriage; & on the Lysistrata. Occasionally he read a quotation from a book by Proust; (whose name Iâ€™ve forgotten), & then from his translation (of the Lysistrata); & we woke next morning to find the hills covered in snow, & came up in a bitter wind & rain to the Omega; so to Gordon Sqre; where first the new Delacroix & then the CÃ©zanne were produced. There are 6 apples in the CÃ©zanne picture. What can 6 apples not be? I began to wonder. Theres their relationship to each other, & their colour, & their solidity. To Roger & Nessa, moreover, it was a far more intricate question than this. It was a question of pure paint or mixed; if pure which colour: emerald or veridian; & then the laying on of the paint; & the time heâ€™d spent, & how heâ€™d altered it, & why, & when heâ€™d painted itâ€”We carried it into the next room, & Lord! how it showed up the pictures there, as if you put a real stone among sham ones; the canvas of the others seemed scraped with a thin layer of rather cheap paint. The apples positively got redder & rounder & greener. I suspect some very mysterious quality of potation (?) in that picture. All day it rained, & L. was out to tea, & brought Goldie home to dinner. Goldie was â€œhumiliatedâ€ by the fall of Bailleul, but told his neat well groomed stories, & I went to the Guild, which pleased me, by its good sense, & the evidence that it does somehow stand for something real to these women. In spite of their solemn passivity they have a deeply hidden & inarticulate desire for something beyond the daily life; I believe they relish all the pomp of officers & elections because in some way it symbolises this other thing. They recanted their abuse of the woman on syphilis, which I think to their credit. Since then they have learnt, they said that she only spoke the truth. They wish me to get them a speaker on Sex Education, Mrs Hiscoke telling us that she had had to get a friend to explain the period to her own daughter, & she still feels shy if the daughter is in the room when sexual subjects are discussed. Sheâ€™s 23 years old.

On Wednesday (17 April), L. went to lunch with Rowntree, & accomplished another stage of his progress to the Editorâ€™s chair. A dummy copy is to be prepared. R. still hedges, on the question of expense, but remarked all the same â€œThou art the man!â€ L.â€™s hand shook so that he had no luncheon. This came entirely of discussing the question before he went up. I went to Caslonâ€™s, & sat in that solid impressive room among the empty desks & smooth tables while they went to fetch me 1/6 worth of hâ€™s (lower case) & the Printer of the bank of England ordered 2,000 lbs of type to be conveyed at once in a van, the weight being beyond the capacity of a taxi. I find immense satisfaction in hearing the talk of these solid, competent business men, who give their orders with such weight & simplicity & never a word wasted, & such character of a plain sort, in every movement & feature. To tea at the 17 Club; & Alix & Bryn & Noel there, & I rather disliked them all. On Thursday we took a little walk, but in the teeth of such wind that there was little pleasure in it. Then L. had to dine with Margaret. He is becoming almost a diner out. But in our circle this is a matter more of business than of pleasure. One goes either to meet someone, or to settle something, or to say goodbye to a prisoner. Bertieâ€™s case still hangs fire however. Today I got Desmondâ€™s book, sent, Iâ€™m sorry to say, by request of the author. Richmond, when I asked for D.â€™s & Lyttonâ€™s books said â€œCertainlyâ€”if you can keep it secretâ€. I couldnâ€™t promise to do this, & therefore wrote to tell him not to send them. And now I must inform Desmond & Lytton. They wonâ€™t suffer really I believe, but they will be anxious instead of safe, & Iâ€™m in two minds as to whether Iâ€™m glad or sorry. I think I could have said some very clever things, & a few true things, but undoubtedly one cant avoid a certain uneasiness in writing formally of people one knows so well.
