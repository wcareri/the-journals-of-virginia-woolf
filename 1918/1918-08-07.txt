### Wednesday 7 August

Asheham diary drains off my meticulous observations of flowers, clouds, beetles & the price of eggs; &, being alone, there is no other event to record. Our tragedy has been the squashing of a caterpillar; our excitement the return of the servants from Lewes last night, laden with all L.â€™s war books & the English review for me, with Brailsford upon a League of Nations, & Katherine Mansfield on Bliss. I threw down Bliss with the exclamation, â€œSheâ€™s done for!â€ Indeed I dont see how much faith in her as woman or writer can survive that sort of story. I shall have to accept the fact, Iâ€™m afraid, that her mind is a very thin soil, laid an inch or two deep upon very barren rock. For Bliss is long enough to give her a chance of going deeper. Instead she is content with superficial smartness; & the whole conception is poor, cheap, not the vision, however imperfect, of an interesting mind. She writes badly too. And the effect was as I say, to give me an impression of her callousness & hardness as a human being. I shall read it again; but I dont suppose I shall change. Sheâ€™ll go on doing this sort of thing, perfectly to her & Murryâ€™s satisfaction. Iâ€™m relieved now that they didnâ€™t come. Or is it absurd to read all this criticism of her personally into a story?

Anyhow I was very glad to go on with my Byron. He has at least the male virtues. In fact, Iâ€™m amused to find how easily I can imagine the effect he had upon womenâ€”especially upon rather stupid or uneducated women, unable to stand up to him. So many too, would wish to reclaim him. Ever since I was a child (as Gertler would say, as if it proved him a particularly remarkable person,) Iâ€™ve had the habit of getting full of some biography, & wanting to build up my imaginary figure of the person with every scrap of news I could find about him. During the passion, the name of Cowper or Byron or whoever it might be, seemed to start up in the most unlikely pages. And then, suddenly, the figure becomes distant & merely one of the usual dead. Iâ€™m much impressed by the extreme badness of B.â€™s poetryâ€”such of it as Moore quotes with almost speechless admiration. Why did they think this Album stuff the finest fire of poetry? It reads hardly better than L.E.L. or Ella Wheeler Wilcox. And they dissuaded him from doing what he knew he could do which was to write satire. He came home from the East with satires (parodies of Horace) in his bag & Childe Harold. He was persuaded that Childe Harold was the best poem ever written. But he never as a young man, believed in his poetry; a proof, in such a confident dogmatic person, that he hadnâ€™t the gift. The Wordsworths & Keatsâ€™ believe in that as much as they believe in anything. In his character, Iâ€™m often reminded a little of Rupert Brooke, though this is to Rupertâ€™s disadvantage. At any rate Byron had superb force; his letters prove it. He had in many ways a very fine nature too; though as no one laughed him out of his affectations, he became more like Horace Cole than one could wish. He could only be laughed at by a woman, & they worshipped instead. I havenâ€™t yet come to Lady Byron, but I suppose, instead of laughing, she merely disapproved. And so he became Byronic.
