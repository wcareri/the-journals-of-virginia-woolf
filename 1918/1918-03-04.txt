### Monday 4 March

L. took 4 pages to the printer today to print off. I being useless for this purpose went off to get into touch with London again, which I did at the three usual pointsâ€”Mudieâ€™s, London Library & Seventeen Club. London, from a spectacular point of view was at its worst; like a middle aged charwoman with hair scrubbed off a bleak forehead. In St Jamesâ€™ Square a village of houses has been built to shelter some ministry, I suppose; & it was strange to see how holes have been cut in the walls & the roofs to allow the trees to stand undamaged. Some of the clerks will have a tree trunk to wipe their pens upon. I found a silent group at the Club, all men, & unknown to me, with the exception of Alix who sat still as a statue reading one of Berty Russellâ€™s books. I interrupted though this is against my principles, & we had tea together. Her chief piece of news was that she & Saxon are going to set up together in Faithâ€™s house after Easter, for the duration of the war & 6 months beyond it. I fancy that they see something a little comic in this combination of the hopelessly enamoured, & indeed one canâ€™t help smiling rather at the thought of silences in which each will be thinking of someone else; & one fancies their common bond leading to a great deal of sympathetic collaboration, but the plan is evidently a good one. It recommended itself first to Mrs Bridgeman, the housekeeper, who thought two such quiet people should live together. I did my best, this time, to keep low in tone, serious, & as far as possible sympathetic. Alixâ€™s feeling had been, she said, that I â€˜floatedâ€™, & didnâ€™t mind how my prosperity reminded both her & Fredegond of all the things they lacked. But why should F. lack anything? I left her sitting there, as I believe she always sits, till they turn out the lights, or James comes to take her to dinner. What will she be at 45?

Home to find the two darkies (Perera and Jayatilaka) here. L. spent 3 hours or so printing, but did it in the end.
