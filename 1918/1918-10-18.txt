### Friday 18 October

Its quite obvious of course that for some reason perhaps not creditable to me I think H.F. worth many more words than Ka say, or Saxon, both of whom have dined here since. My theory is that for some reason the human mind is always seeking what it conceives to be the centre of things; sometimes one may call it reality, again truth, again lifeâ€”I dont know what I call it; but I distinctly visualise it as a possession rather more in H.F.â€™s hands than in other peoples. For the moment he makes all the rest of the worldâ€™s activities appear as ramifications radiating from him. But this is roughly statedâ€”

Old Ka anyhow is not in the knot in the middle of the web. She came alone, Will having hurt his knee; & not being there in the flesh, one didnâ€™t trace him in the spirit. She seemed unchanged; but I think decidedly happier, a little defiant on Willâ€™s behalf. The poor little gentle, weakly creature is stated to be wild & queer & his action in giving up his patrimony & refusing to go to Balliol is brought forward as proof. For myself I distrust young men who return to nature on the Wiltshire Downs, paint pictures of the sky only, & want more than anything to fly. I own though that Iâ€™m judging from my ancient view of him at Fitzroy Sqre. Saxon, we assume, has found complete consolation in Mrs Stagg & a new set of gold teeth. We have never seen him so sprightly, bold & communicative. He is already talking of his next visit to Bayreuth. He did not knit Barbaraâ€™s childâ€™s drawers; & only showed a slight asperity when Nick was mentioned. But I write hurriedly, giving no account of the Albert Museum, nor of our suspension over what one of the papers calls â€˜the precipice of peaceâ€™, since I must read a little about Voltaire before going up to hear a Promenade Concert at the Queenâ€™s Hall. The truth is that nothing much more definite is yet known about peace. Wilsonâ€™s second note came out on Tuesday, in which he used the word â€˜peradventureâ€™; so far the Germans have not answered. But their Retreat goes on, & last night, beautiful, cloudless, still & moonlit, was to my thinking the first of peace, since one went to bed fairly positive that never again in all our lives need we dread the moonlight.
