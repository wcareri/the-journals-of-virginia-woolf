### Saturday 3 August

Thereâ€™s nothing but rustic news to record, since as we expected the Murrys have put us off. Katherine writes that sheâ€™s ill. I cant help guessing that she may be rather hopelessly ill. Anyhow its out of the question that she should come here. The weather hasnâ€™t held good. Yesterday was as wet a day as England often produces. Almost always the afternoon is dry in England; & so it was more or less. We went mushrooming in the evening, & got a handkerchief full. So one of our great excitements has begun again. One ripe blackberry was found at the top. As I lay in the grass a hare loped past me. Perhaps weâ€™re rather pleased to be alone after all.

Better weather today, though a black sky is about the ugliest thing in nature. L. to Lewes. He went to fetch a parcel from the New Statesman which wasnâ€™t there. I round M.â€™s walk, & over the top. My record must be solely of beetles & butterflies. A ray of sun brings out the brown heaths in any number. Over Newhaven an airship floated, & the sky being blue for a space the sea was too. It struck me as odd to think of all the blazing blue safely burning behind the clouds; & how a ray on the earth made a different place of it. I must go and pick â€™shrooms, the sun being out.
