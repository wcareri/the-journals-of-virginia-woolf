### Monday 19 August

Its possible that we may have solved the problem of having visitorsâ€”not to see them. At this moment A. & K. are in the house, as an occasional sound from the drawing room proves. But we only meet at meals; so that it is possible to think of things to say in the intervals. I find that deafness imposes itself upon the mind as well as the voice; it frightens away the quicker shyer deeper thoughts so that all the talk that reaches a deaf person must be of the same hearty, plain, matter of fact kind. Try as one will, one canâ€™t do otherwise. Carrington came for the weekend. She is the easiest of visitors as she never stops doing thingsâ€”pumping, scything, or walking. I suspect part of this is intentional activity, lest she should bore; but it has its advantages. After trudging out here, she trudged to Charleston, & only came in at eleven last night, just as we were shutting the windows. Poor lugubrious Bunny escorted her, protesting that a 10 mile walk was nothing compared to the joy of having some one to talk to. She trudged off again this morning to pack Lyttonâ€™s box or buy him a hair brush in Londonâ€”a sturdy figure, dressed in a print dress, made after the pattern of one in a John picture; a thick mop of golden red hair, & a fat decided clever face, with staring bright blue eyes. The whole just misses, but decidedly misses what might be vulgarity. She seems to be an artistâ€”seems, I say, for in our circle the current that way is enough to sweep people with no more art in them than Barbara in that direction. Still, I think Carrington cares for it genuinely, partly because of her way of looking at pictures.

I finished by the way The Electra of Sophocles, which has been dragging on down here, though itâ€™s not so fearfully difficult after all. The thing that always impresses me fresh is the superb nature of the story. It seems hardly possible not to make a good play of it. This perhaps is the result of having traditional plots which have been made & improved & freed from superfluities by the polish of innumerable actors & authors & critics, till it becomes like a lump of glass worn smooth in the sea. Also, if everyone in the audience knows beforehand what is going to happen, much finer & subtler touches will tell, & words can be spared. At anyrate my feeling always is that one canâ€™t read too carefully, or attach enough weight to every line & hint; & that the apparent bareness is only on the surface. There does, however, remain the question of reading the wrong emotions into the text. I am generally humiliated to find how much Jebb is able to see; my only doubt is whether he doesnâ€™t see too muchâ€”as I think one might do with a bad modern English play if one set to work. Finally, the particular charm of Greek remains as strong & as difficult to account for as ever. One feels the immeasurable difference between the text & the translation with the first words. The heroic woman is much the same in Greece & England. She is of the type of Emily BrontÃ«. Clytaemnestra & Electra are clearly mother & daughter, & therefore should have some sympathy, though perhaps sympathy gone wrong breeds the fiercest hate. E. is the type of woman who upholds the family above everything; the father. She has more veneration for tradition than the sons of the house; feels herself born of the fatherâ€™s side, & not of the motherâ€™s. Its strange to notice how, although the conventions are perfectly false & ridiculous, they never appear petty or undignified, as our English conventions are constantly made to do. Electra lived a far more hedged in life than the women of the mid Victorian age, but this has no effect upon her, except in making her harsh & splendid. She could not go out for a walk alone; with us it would be a case of a maid & a hansom cab.
