### Monday 8 April

There is an awkward moment between coming back from London & dinner which is the salvation of this book. For some reason one canâ€™t settle to read, & yet writing seems the proper channel for the unsettled irritable condition one is generally in. Perhaps this condition is intensified by tea at the 17 Club, particularly if one happens to meet Roger in the Charing Cross Road, in his wideawake hat with four or five yellow French books under his arm. He is the centre of a whirlwind to me. Under this influence I was blown straight into a book shop, persuaded to lay out 3/7 on a French novel, Et Cie, by a Jew, made to fix a day for coming to Durbins, invited to a play & fairly overwhelmedâ€”made to bristle all over with ideas, questions, possibilities which couldnâ€™t develope in the Charing Cross Rd. Of course he was in a hurry to keep an appointment at the Burlington, & to produce one or two plays somewhere elseâ€”ill too, so he said, but somewhat relieved in his mind by reading Fabre, who makes him see that after all our war, hideous though it isâ€”but here we parted. I ran in to a kind of backwater of Roger at the 17 Club: Goldie, & Miss Dudley at least. Mrs Manus & Langdon Davies & L. canâ€™t be included under that heading. We sat in the groundfloor room; & poor old Goldie wrinkled his forehead & flung himself lightly & ardently into one question after another in his usual wayâ€”the way of a bachelor who lives by plying his mind & moving by that means from person to person, having no settled abode. A sort of gipsy or vagrant. He mourned all the deaths of the young menâ€”Eric Whitehead the last to be killed. Said that he would fight if young enough; as it is he sits on committees. I left them to conduct another committee, & went to Poland St. to get my watch. On the way I walked through a narrow street lined on both sides with barrows, where stockings & ironmongery & candles & fish were being sold. A barrel organ played in the middle. I bought 6 bundles of coloured tapers. The stir & colour & cheapness pleased me to the depths of my heart. But I couldnâ€™t pay 5/6 for my watch, owing to the seductive magic of Roger in the Charing X Road, & so had to leave it, ticking away like a young watch. Home by Victoria. A sunny evening, swarming with people.
