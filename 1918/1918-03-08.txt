### Friday 8 March

From yesterdayâ€™s writing it looks as if the raids were casting their shadow before me, & were sent expressly by God to rebuke my arrogance. However this may be, we played our patience; I lost my 3 and so to bed, the only thought in our minds being, I think, something to do with patience or printing. Iâ€™d taken my third & final roll in bed, when there was an explosion. For half a minute a raid seemed so improbable that we made out it was one of the inexplicable outbursts of motor omnibuses. However, next minute the guns went off all round us & we heard the whistles. There was no denying it. So we got our things together & went to the kitchen. This was at 11.30. Looking out we could only see stars yellowish in some sort of mist; no moon; but a still night. As we lay down on our mattresses there was a great though distant explosion; & after that the guns set in very thick & fast to north & south, never, but once, so near us as Barnes. At 12.45 we had cocoa & went to bed. The bugles sounded at 1.35â€”two hours from start to finish.

I shall never forget the ecstasy with which L. burst into my room at breakfast. The wretch Williams has caved in. He agrees to cancel the contract. L. was as triumphant as a fighting beast who has driven his enemy to skulk into the bushes. I think he has reason to be. For one thing it looked as though he could still worry & impede for some months to come; & L. might have been forced to arbitrate. As it is, the way is open, & instead of dealing with a surly unwilling spiteful mangy exasperating cur, he can make his own termsâ€”which heâ€™s doing this afternoon with Allen & Unwin. Going up in the lift at Holborn the other day I stood next a boy of 14 or so, whose head only was visible among the crowd. I noticed that it was an extremely interesting, sensitive, clever, observant head; rather sharp, but independent looking. One couldnâ€™t tell from his cap whether he was well off or not. I came to the conclusion that he was the son of an officer with whom he stood. When we got into the street I looked at once at his legs. His trousers had holes in them. From that one could judge what a wretched affair his life will be. I began setting up Cecilâ€™s poems this afternoon. Theyâ€™re not good; they show the Woolf tendency to denunciation, without the vigour of my particular Woolf. I had all sorts of accidents & only finished one.
