### Tuesday 27 August

Now I confess that I have half forgotten what I meant to say about the German prisoners; Milton & life. I think it was that? (all I can remember now (Friday, Aug. 30th) is that the existence of life in another human being is as difficult to realise as a play of Shakespeare when the book is shut. This occurred to me when I saw Adrian talking to the tall German prisoner. By rights they should have been killing each other. The reason why it is easy to kill another person must be that oneâ€™s imagination is too sluggish to conceive what his life means to himâ€”the infinite possibilities of a succession of days which are furled in him, & have already been spent. However, I forget how this was to go on. The prisoner, who looks very lean & hopeless, seemed to like talking; I met him later & we smiled, but the sentry was not there.

Here we are almost at the end of August, & finishing off A. & K.â€™s visit. They go to Charleston tomorrow. Its odd how in a visit of this kind one wears through different stages. My stages are on the whole nearer to warmth & liking than to irritation; though there is an element of criticism in our relationship, based partly on K.â€™s manners, appetite & appearance. Which last, poor woman, she canâ€™t altogether help; still there seems no need to emphasise the natural process by an orange dressing gown, held in by a broad band. Her appetite is frankly a schoolboyâ€™s. â€œWhat beef!â€ she exclaimed today. â€œDont you feel elated at the sight of good meat?â€ Meals add a sort of romance to her life such as I in my way get, shall we say, from the post or the newspapers. I can imagine Karin, for instance, thinking with a little thrill that next day is the day for salt beef; as I think perhaps I shall get my book from the Times, or an interesting letter. L. on the other hand, is irritated, & being irritated by superficial disagreeables finds deeper causes for them than I altogether agree with. Our usual method is to begin â€œWhy did Adrian marry her?â€ Then I say â€œI can quite understand itâ€”she has energyâ€ & so on. Then L. says â€œIâ€™d a thousand times rather have married Kaâ€”In fact Iâ€™d rather have married any one in the whole world. I couldnâ€™t sit in the same room with her.â€ Still, I do see why Adrian married her. First & foremost she makes him like other people. He has always, I believe, a kind of suspicion that whereas other people are professionals, he remains an amateur. She provides him with household, children, bills, daily life, so that to all appearances he is just like other people. I believe he needs constant reassurance on this point; & takes constant delight in her substantiality. Yes, one wants to be found doing the ordinary things when oneâ€™s friends call. I too have this feeling to some extent. I suppose indeed that I share many of A.â€™s feelings. A feeling comes over me when I am with him that instead of being comfortably obtuse we are crepuscular to each other; & thus, among other things, fearfully shy when we are alone. With other people in the room we get on much better. We had a walk to the post marked by those cloggings of the wheels, which are so discomfiting; nothing seems possible; then with an odious jerk one jars on again. This was better managed than of old. He lost his diffidence & air of hearing himself talk when he told me about Karin; how deaf she is, & how depressed she gets, & how she thinks that people wonâ€™t talk loud on purpose, & thus dislikes all Stracheys & others of the low voiced mumbling family. He is very proud of her vitality. I suppose it provides him with a good deal of the stuff of life, which he does not provide for himself.

Yesterday, 22nd, I bicycled to Charleston, lunched, & came home in the evening. It was the first autumn day, warm, softly blue, & blurred with haze. Duncan spent the night before with us. He stumbled along until, by means which he only knows the secret of, he had us all laughing until the tears came. His chief effort was a description of Lady Strachey reading aloud Laurence Housmanâ€™s The Dying ploughboy speaks from the Graveâ€”

â€œI hear the bells jingling, & I lie in my mothers bed. The finest poem in the language too.â€ Then we discussed the bursting of peopleâ€™s bladders, the National Gallery, incest, perhaps, & other gossip. All sitting in the drawing room, until it grew too dark to see. We have lamps almost at dinner; but not quite. I gossiped with Nessa. A new plan is on foot to supply her with Liz for a cook. Trissie is goingâ€”but never again into service. She is one of the transition casesâ€”the servant not yet turned lady, but past servanthood. Karin & A. have gone into Brighton to see a specialist about her ear.
