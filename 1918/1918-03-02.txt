### Saturday 2 March

What is the use of finishing a sentence left unfinished a month ago? Here we are; evening; I came back from Asheham, or rather Charleston, an hour ago. After Karin went that Wednesday, rather a monotonous time began for me. Influenza began on the Friday; I was kept in bed 8 days; on the next Tuesday (19 February) we went to Asheham. My chief complaint is that I was divorced from my pen; a whole current of life cut offâ€”Secondly I saw no one; for 5 days I wasnâ€™t in a state for reading; but I did finally read Morley & other books; but reading when done to kill time has a kind of drudgy look in it. I was asked to write a book in a seriesâ€”Makers of the 19th Century; but after deliberation refused, nor did it at any moment seem possible. But I write this down partly to give an official look to this diary, & partly because it marks a middle aged condition. Undoubtedly the country develops the spiritual side of life. One day I sat in the garden reading Shakespeare; I remember the ecstasy: every other day at least we had to walk to Southease for milk; we were only allowed one quart a dayâ€”7d a quart. The garden shows great promise. L. dug up the large bed, & transferred plants from the round middle bed to our path bed. The buds visible on the trees; sheep in the hurdles on the side of the down. For 9 of our 10 days we saw no one; my letters even failed fairly completely; but the days melted into each other like snowballs roasting in the sun. On Thursday (28 February) Nessa came for the night, & I went back with her to Charleston for Friday night, L. taking the servants up to town. Henry Moss had just arrived. We all met for dinner, for to my relief N. & I had tea alone in the drawing room. Moss & Mrs Brereton give off a fairly strong atmosphere of the paid & paying guest kind which is not pleasant. Mrs B. an elderly upright firm unflinching woman, whose integrity has been her chief capital in life. She reminded me strongly of Nurse Reid: she has the professional competence & composure. Moss one might meetâ€”practically anywhere. He is a pale insignificant young man, either very shy or very much out of his element. We carried on as best we could, entirely unhelped by him, & though Mrs B. spoke from a sense of duty, she allowed nothing to blossom in her presence, but dealt with each remark literally & sensibly. Ann, the daughter, is much more charming than one might expectâ€”though no doubt marriage trials & poverty have flattened out Mrs Bâ€™s charm prematurely. She calls H. Moss her â€œadopted sonâ€, which sanctions their withdrawal after dinner to his bed sitting room, where they are supposed to make up stories for the Saturday Westminster. On Saturday morning Nessa, Duncan & I sat in the studio & gossiped. Part of the time we discussed art. This is what I like doing best with them. They say that thereâ€™s no one worth considering as a painter in England todayâ€”no one like K.M. or Forster even with whom its worth discussing oneâ€™s business. In France this is reversed. Nessa showed me Saxonâ€™s letters. He has made her his confidante. He has been very unhappy; & made out his moments of exaltation & depression with his usual minuteness. In one he said that it was curious no longer to care for anything, death being as desirable as life. And then details about his health. We discussed also the peril of society, which has to some extent washed off poor old Desmondâ€™s bloom, & would submerge Maynard, if he were an artist. I left at 1.15, walking in a high wind with 2 parcels slung across my shoulders, to Glynde; through the park. Back here for tea, & met L. buying the Hanwell Gazette. I found a letter from Saxonâ€”a little cold, I canâ€™t help thinking, at least showing one, after his letters to Nessa, that in this crisis Iâ€™m not his confidante. Its queer how one chooses one figure each time oneâ€™s in a state for reasons not perceptible to the figure herself. Last winter I was to hear everything.
