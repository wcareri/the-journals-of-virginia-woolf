### Wednesday 9 January

The 17 Club is something of a lure; certainly promises better conditions for tea than a shop. So, having gone for my spectacles, I went to Gerrard Street. Found Fredegond & Faith there, also a large semi-circle of Cambridge youths; including a young man with a flop of hair who had written a play, which he had with him; the pipe-smoking girl, & one or two others. I was amused at the repetition of certain old scenes from my own pastâ€”the obvious excitement, & sense of being the latest & best (though not outwardly the most lovely) of Godâ€™s works, of having things to say for the first time in history; there was all this; & the young men so wonderful in the eyes of the young women, & young women so desirable in the eyes of the young men, though this was not perceptible to me sitting elderly upon my sofaâ€”This sort of talkâ€”

â€œAh, but have you read his play? & do you approve?â€  
â€œMost decidedly I do.â€  
â€œAnd you like the handling.â€  
â€œOh immensely!â€

Then a second, less favoured young woman, leans forward & says,

â€œBut may I see it?â€  
â€œCertainlyâ€ says the youth, & produces it from a despatch box, to the girlâ€™s delight.  
â€œI represent the public. Edithâ€™s so unconventional.â€

However, then I was summoned to have my tea at the far end of the room; & Lytton came in, carrying Lord Morley, whom heâ€™s reviewing for L. We tried still to overhear young Cambridge, & Lâ (ytton). finally decamped, on my daring him, to that party, now grown even larger by the addition of several young men with large foreheads, hair combed back, in hiding from the police.

I then had some private talk with Faith. According to her Nick is getting a great deal of pain from the Saxon Barbara Nick combination. His claims are disregarded; Barbara prefers Saxon; & seems to be ashamed of the unintellectuality of Nick. She wont take him to see her Bloomsbury friends. Bloomsbury, I think, will have one more corpse to its credit; for poor B.â€™s attainments arenâ€™t such as to give her a very secure footing there; & to my thinking a marriage with Nick offers more solid value than a cold blooded & only semi-real attachment with Saxon. I explained my view, with which both Faith & Fredegond agreed. I promised kindness; in case kindness persuades Barbara that thereâ€™s more in N. than she sees. Her snobbishness is irritating though natural. In the street my grey knickers came off. So it happened once to Emmy Fisher, & she wrapped a starving dog in them. Fredegond walked with me to Charing Cross. I feel like her in some fundamental way.
