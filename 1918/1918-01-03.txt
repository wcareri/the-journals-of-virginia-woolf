### Thursday 3 January 1918

I forget who it was that came in at this moment; & I have excuse for forgetting, since it is now Thursday, 3rd Jan. 1918. & weâ€™re just back from Asheham. I remember though that the last days were full of people. Walter & Molly as I began to relateâ€”She has sent her novel to Chatto & Windus, & calls it The Band on the Pier, or Ring Fence. The last dull I think. W.L. spruce & a little suspicious when the Royal Family appeared, as it did; wouldnâ€™t shoot at those rabbits again for my diversion. And then I can remember that we had Ka; who contemplates resignation; & then, the night after, Bob; with his pockets bulging with Georgian poetry, his talk all of books & prices asked for printing, & number of copies sold, in the midst of which Nelly burst in to say that the Take Cover had sounded. So we had our dinner partly in the cellar; Bob talking at such a rate that it was necessary to listen at the window for the guns, loud enough though they were. I remember him attached to a large plate of suet pudding in the basement, & L. sitting on a wooden box in the coal hole reading the paper & finding one of my red pens there. All clear sounded about 10: a bad raid, though, & Barbara & Saxon suffered more than we did at Hampstead.

After thatâ€”the very next nightâ€”we went to the 17 Club dinner; a great deal of eating by some 200 people at long tables. Waiters thudding swing doors imitated guns so successfully that various officials came round & warned one of a raid. Jos. (Wedgwood) made a speech. I noticed poor Marjorie listening with her eyes on her lap. She came up from Darlington, & was dressed, poor creature, in muslin picked out with red roses & cut low; though every one else was more or less in working clothes, & fur capes. I was caught in the net of Sylvia Whitham, who cross examined me about her husbands novels; & in despair of revealing my true opinion I pretended never to have read Wolfgangâ€”Most suitably, of all our friends shes the one to have a bomb dropped next door, & to receive it without surprise. And sheâ€™s taking to literature, & begins by translating Flaubertâ€”a remarkable instance of a person without gift of any kind, always pushing along in the wake of other more advanced people.

Next day we went to Asheham, & the journey was the worst in our recordâ€”5 hours; spent mostly outside Clapham Junction; fog, bitter cold; every move stopping short in a minute or two. Motored out, I remember, & found the roads under snow; but very pleasant coming into the drawing room, save that we were without milk.

One of the coldest & finest of Christmases. Rather to our relief, we spent it alone, Ray falling ill, Ka coming for week end, & Nessaâ€™s children. There was the usual visit from Maynard & Clive; my usual failure to get to Charleston corresponding to Nessaâ€™s failure to get to Asheham. I spent a night there, & enjoyed (?) myself, through the rather obtuse barrier of poor Bunny, who took to his bed at one point, without sympathy from Nessa, who had often put him to bed, she said, for no perceivable cause. Duncan came back from London, with gossip for us; chiefly about Alix & a party at the play, who broke the partition dropped cigarettes, & had to be asked to leave. But what I like most about Asheham is that I read books there; so divine it is, coming in from a walk to have tea by the fire & then read & readâ€”say Othelloâ€”say anything. It doesnâ€™t seem to matter what. But oneâ€™s faculties are so oddly clarified that the page detaches itself in its true meaning & lies as if illumined, before oneâ€™s eyes; seen whole & truly not in jerks & spasms as so often in London. And then the trees, spare & leafless; the brown of the plough, &, yesterday, downs mountainous through a mist, which isnâ€™t palpable, for only dead detail vanishes & the live grows larger & larger, & fires can be seen burning through. Solitary sportsmen beat up duck & snipe on the marshes. Windows were almost always frozen in the morning, & each blade rough with frost. Partridges would come & sit in the field, lifeless little lumps they looked, half stiff with cold perhaps.

The diary habit has come to life at Charleston. Bunny sat up late on the Old Yearâ€™s night writing, & Duncan came back with a ledger, bought in Lambs Conduit Street. The sad thing is that we darenâ€™t trust each other to read our books; they lie, like vast consciences, in our most secret drawers. Clive, by the way, enlivened Christmas by a small book of verseâ€”the prose fantastically foppish, the verse very pretty & light, to my mind (by wh. I mean not altogether to L.â€™s mind). He can do his little Owl very efficientlyâ€”Anyhow, I prefer it to the last Georgian effortâ€”bound in blue this year, & housing that ridiculous Squire.

So we come to an end of the year, & any attempt to sum it up is beyond me, or even to cast a final glance at the evening paper, with news from Russia, which has just come in and drawn L. to remark

â€œA very interesting state of thingsâ€”â€  
â€œAnd whatâ€™s going to happen?â€  
â€œNo human being can foretell that.â€
