### Saturday 4 May

Hodson came to lunch. A soldier now, though by profession a civil servant. A hard, straightforward man, all about him seeming as close cropped as his head. A man of average gifts, I suppose, & thus a sample of what the world does to human beings. He has no special gift or fortune to palliate life. In this light I thought him rather sad; so grim, unpretending, & taking what comes as if it were anyhow good enough for him. He didnâ€™t like the war, but joined â€œas a dutyâ€. First the bachelors went, then the married men, then those who could afford to. His passage cost him Â£200. But there was no trace of heroism in this: mere â€œsuch is lifeâ€. He went to Kew with Leonard. I to the printer who remains shut. The first fine day since April 1st, or thereabouts. Hot, blue sky, no wind. Birds singing; & people swarming.
