& so many things have accumulated, that I can hardly proceed to that masterly summing up of the Webbs which I intended. I intended in particular to dwell upon the half carping half humorously cynical view which steals into oneâ€™s description of the Webbs. I had meant to point out the good qualities which come from such well kept brisk intellectual habits; how open minded they showed themselves; how completely & consistently sensible. That, I think, deserves a line under it. Good sense seems to me their invariable characteristic. How sensible it was not to fuss about goodbye, or a Collins; how sensibly they approach every question whether of servants or politics, putting their minds at your service without the least ostentation or flummery. Their horizon is entirely clear, unless in the case of Mrs Webb, as the medium said, a cloud of dust surrounds them; they have no illusions; they survey the whole panorama, which is amazingly clear to them, stoically, both for the race & for themselves as individuals. Sidney is the warmer & more human of the two, & one could even commit the impropriety of liking him personally, which one can hardly do in the case of Mrs Webb. How stoically with his perpetual little smile, he remarked that they are now 60, & therefore may expect a stroke within the next 5 years; but if he could arrange things with the divine messenger, he would compound somehow to die precisely at the same moment with â€œmy wifeâ€.

By rights Lottie should have a whole chapter to herself at this point; but to live through those things is unpleasant enough without reviving them here. At this moment owing to what she overheard L. say to me before breakfast, I am uncertain whether we have 2 servants or not, & to tell the truth, completely indifferent, such is the relief of being without them for a fortnight. Considering their unimportance they must be compared to flies in the eye for the discomfort they can produce in spite of being so small. But let us change the subject.

I went over to Charleston last Tuesday & was shown his shells by Quentin; sat with Nessa & laid bare my sorrows, which she can more than match; & then Clive & Mary arrived in a motor car for teaâ€”so many were their parcels & bags; & indeed Mary produced chocolates, cakes & sweets in abundance. Iâ€™m ashamed to say that that is my chief impression, but I left soon after, & they promised to spend a night here, so that I left unsaid & unasked all my ideas & questions. She was, as usual, mute as a troutâ€”I say trout because of her spotted dress, & also because, though silent, she has the swift composure of a fish. I walked home shoving my bicycle, too badly punctured to ride.

Well then the Times began to shower books upon me, & I was reduced at one point to writing my review in the afternoon, nor can I discover any reason why oneâ€™s brains should be unavailable between 3 & 5. When the telegraph girl rode up with a telegram from Clive to put us off, owing to some disease of Maryâ€™s, we were both immensely relieved, & I threw down my pen, as they say, & ate a large tea, & found my load of writing much lessened. When I have to review at command of a telegram, & Mr Geal has to ride off in a shower to fetch the book at Glynde, & comes & taps at the window about 10 at night to receive his shilling & hand in the parcel, I feel pressed & important & even excited a little. For a wonder, the book, Hudson, was worth reading. Then on Saturday we went to Lewes by train & bought a two handled saw, & fish, & envelopes, & then met Gertler at the station & came out here.

Whether our exclamations on parting from our guests are good evidence, I donâ€™t know, but on this occasion we both cried â€œGood God, what an egoist!â€ We have been talking about Gertler to Gertler for some 30 hours; it is like putting a microscope to your eye. One molehill is wonderfully clear; the surrounding world ceases to exist. But he is a forcible young man; if limited, able & respectable within those limits; as hard as a cricket ball; & as tightly rounded & stuffed in at the edges. We discussedâ€”well, it always came back to be Gertler.. â€œI have a very peculiar character â€¦ I am not like any other artist â€¦ My picture would not have those blank spaces â€¦ I donâ€™t see that, because in my case I have a sense which other people donâ€™t have â€¦ I saw in a moment what she had never dreamt of seeingâ€¦â€ & so on. And if you do slip a little away, he watches very jealously, from his own point of view, & somehow tricks you back again. He hoards an insatiable vanity. I suspect the truth to be that he is very anxious for the good opinion of people like ourselves, & would immensely like to be thought well of by Duncan, Vanessa & Roger. His triumphs have been too cheap so far. However this is honestly outspoken, & as I say, he has power & intelligence, & will, one sees, paint good interesting pictures, though some rupture of the brain would have to take place before he could be a painter.
