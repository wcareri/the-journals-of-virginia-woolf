### Tuesday 17 December

This I cannot help fearing will be my last opportunity for writing before I go to Asheham on Friday, though I shall continue there, God being willing, in some form of new book. Tomorrow I go to K.M. Thursday I have tea with the Richmonds, & perhaps dine at the Club; so Friday is reached without any interval between tea & dinner; & even today I am stealing what belongs to Sophocles, before Mrs Hamilton arrives at 7 to address the Guild. Suppose I buy a block, with detachable leaves, I think I shall snare a greater number of loose thoughts. No doubt this is pure fancy, but then so much of oneâ€™s mental affairs are controlled by fancy. Nessa has asked us to have the children for a fortnight when the new baby is born. This is now imminent, & she fixes the 28th for the exact day. The servants go to Guildford for a week, in order that we may be free from Liz & her offspring. We shall have one week entirely alone, at Asheham, the greatest & most unmixed pleasure this world affords; enhanced very much in my mind by the absence of servants, so that often we are alone in the house. I am going to read through my novel & determine what to do with it. L.â€™s book is almost done; February will see it finished most likely. We have printed off the text of Kew Gardens, & got an estimate from McDermott for printing Murryâ€™s poem. He asks Â£4.10. which to us seems little, for 200 copies of a 24 page book. We supply the paper, & the cover. Possibilities are opened up I think.

Weather has been so warm that I dont think Iâ€™ve had a fire in my study more than 3 or 4 times, & that only when we were printing in the afternoon. Influenza seems to be over, though Lottie had an attack lasting an hour or two on Saturday. Iced cakes are possible, but so far no more than that. As for public news, the war already seems an unimportant incident; one of our political dodges, & at this moment the news boys are shouting that Russia prepares for war. It is difficult to see how even a jingo can now believe in any good from war, or any ideal, or anything, one feels tempted to add undertaken by bodies of human beings in concert. It is said that Labour did well, & the Coalition only moderately, at the polls. Ray is said to have a good chance;â€”we voted on Saturday, but L. overcome with panic, very likely voted for Mrs Dacre Fox.
