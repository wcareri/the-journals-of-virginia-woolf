### Friday 5 April

I think that Wednesday was broken off short, as they always tend to be on the verge of a move, & so far as I remember it snowed hailed thundered people. Off we went to Asheham on Thursday, in such a burst of summer heat that people in the Tube pulled blinds down, & the uproar & potency (what word will express the stir of life still cased in a soft velvet sheath?) of Richmond worshipping a Tank was like the hum of bees round some first blossom. We had the bee & the blossom in no metaphorical sense at Asheham. Once more my memory is most centred upon an afternoon reading in the garden. I happened to read Wordsworth; the poem which ends â€œwhat man has made of manâ€. The daffodils were out & the guns I suppose could be heard from the downs. Even to me, who have no immediate stake, & repudiate the importance of what is being done, there was an odd pallor in those particular days of sunshine. Thereâ€™s always a sadness in spring of courseâ€”Our visitors broke in upon the moods which weave so thick a texture into life alone at Asheham. First Lytton. Then we waited, with eyes upon the avenue, for the appearance of Barbara. She never came though, & upon Sunday I had a letter telling the almost incredible story of her repeated attempts to get into a train; how for three days she went to Victoria; & sometimes was kept outside the barrier; sometimes was stuck opposite the gap between the carriages; never got in, & finally spent Easter alone in her studio, expecting, so we are told, to find herself in some 9 months short of a fortnight, the mother of a child. Lytton was with us one day less than a week. Our chief exercise was along the road to Beddingham. We had short, & to me, very intimate talks; intimate in the sense that he will understand from the sight of the tail what the whole body of the thought is in oneâ€™s mind. These thoughts were for the most part about books; but books include a good deal of life. I suspect that he is now inclined to question whether Eminent Victorians, 4 in number, & requiring 4 years for their production, are quite enough to show for his age, & pretensions. At anyrate he was evidently & rather painfully anxious about our opinion of their merits, & came back so often though so tactfully to the question of my review that I hesitate. I suppose the contrast (& to me there is a contrast) between his achievements & L.â€™s achievements made itself felt to him. Then he was sick one morning â€œgreen sicknessâ€, Lottie described it with her usual passion & enthusiasm for painting all colours at their brightest. His ebb of health is very low; & certainly health does make one careful, perhaps a little peevish, spiritually. I remarked, whether the result of bad health or not, a distinct increase in his family pride; it has now reached almost a religious pitch; a bad sign. Like patriotism it means that certain feelings are to grow large & lusty under shelter. For instance, James must be exalted as a man of â€œiron willâ€, superb administrator &c: but the light is shed on each one of the family; & even upon cousins, like Mary H. I rather resent it. Then James & Noel came. Our patience wore rather thin. Visitors do tend to chafe one, though impeccable as friends. Iâ€™m always glad at the end of a visit to find oneâ€™s liking unmodified, as it was in all three cases,â€”yet Iâ€™m puzzled to account for the sense of strain & discomfort which the people one likes most manage to produce. L. & I discussed this. He says that with people in the house his hours of positive pleasure are reduced to one; he has I forget how many hours of negative pleasure; & a respectable margin of the acutely unpleasant. Are we growing old? Are our habits setting in like the Trade Winds? But this time the food difficulties certainly increased oneâ€™s discomfort. One day we came back from a long walk to find the third of a loaf of bread on the table. No more to be had in the house. This was due to bad management on Nellyâ€™s part, but then at Asheham itâ€™s very easy to manage badly & needs considerable thought, cycling & carrying to manage even tolerably. At one point the servants wrought themselves into the usual row. The relief of being back in comparative plenty & anyhow next door to shops is quite recognisable. We came up on Friday, went straight to lunch at Cliffordâ€™s Inn, dived into Partridge & Cooper, & then I came home and L. went to see Bonwick.

The result of seeing Bonwick is what I foretold. They have offered him the editorship of the new Review, & indeed make his acceptance a condition of starting it, which they propose to do at once. Some arrangements must be come to with Wright, but they will solve themselves I suspect. L. has 10 days in which to decide. Thereâ€™s the question of staff, of salary & so on. If he accepts, he will be able to give up feeding the omnivorous & callous throated Eagle with reviews. Considering the merits of that cheap & thin blooded creature, (I speak of his journalism) & his methods of running the paper, his lack of power judgment & competence, I shall consider L. wise to take the other job merely as a means of escape. But in itself too it might be not a means but an end. Thus we had rather a sanguine happy sort of return, considering how disappointing returns generally are.
