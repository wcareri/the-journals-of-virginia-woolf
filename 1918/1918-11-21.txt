### Thursday 21 November

I am overwhelmed with things that I ought to have written about; peace dropped like a great stone into my pool, & the eddies are still rippling out to the further bank. Has Nelly Cecil sunk beyond recall? & that concert at Shelley House, presided over, so appropriately by Bruce Richmond? For the sake of the good report of my diary let me record the fact that Nelly Cecil met the Kaiser at Hatfield: & said he appeared a small man, in a grey suit, & â€œhis people were afraid of himâ€”They were afraid to tell him if his motor car was lateâ€¦. He was romanticâ€”very romantic.â€

Too much space would be needed for an accurate description of Shelley House: briefly speaking it is a luxurious sham in imitation of the 18th century; but as people like the St John Hornbys never put all their eggs in one basket, the Italian renaissance is represented too; &, I should guess, Arthur Hughes shows that they patronise English art; but mainly they put their faith in George the Third. How much the annual income of the audience amounted to, I should not like to guess; they wore a substantial part of it on their backs: the furs were richly dark; the stuffs of the best black. And then the lovely music offered up before this congregationâ€”among whom, as they say, I noticed Mrs Rathbone, Pearsall Smith, Hervey Vaughan Williams, & Mrs Muir Mackenzie.

However peace came & dissipated all that; & now where are we? According to Roger, on the brink of revolution; this is strictly speaking, according to Ray, & Ray, who is standing for Parliament as a Coalition candidate, says that if ever she were tempted to hoard food, now would be the time. The Lower classes are bitter, impatient, powerful, & of course, lacking in reason. For example they demand houses with 10 rooms at Guildford; & they have a prophet, Ditcher by name, who knows the truth; he knows what the brain is made of; & he has no use for the â€œmiddle class idealismâ€ which cherishes doubts about some matters, & preaches liberty, toleration, & other humbug; for Ditcher knows the truth. These are a few facts that I gathered from Roger over a dish of tripe & leeks. I cheered him a little by reminding him of the existence of football & of King George. How they crowdâ€”my memories of the past week! Mention of King George recalls Harry Stephen who sat like a frog with his legs akimbo, opening & shutting his large knife, & asserting with an egoism proper to all Stephens, that he knew how to behave himself, & how other people ought to behave, which science he taught, with success according to him, upon the Bench at Calcutta. He has need of the Royal Family; he wants someone descended from Egbert upon the throne; not a schoolmaster, like Wilson. The impenetrable wall of the middle class conservative was never more stolid; dynamite may smash it to powder; butâ€”it is impervious to reason, or imagination or humanity; an educated version of the prophet Ditcher.

Poor James Strachey was soft as moss, lethargic as an earthworm. James, billed at the 17 Club to lecture on â€œOnanismâ€, proposes to earn his living as an exponent of Freud in Harley Street. For one thing, you can dispense with a degree.

But the real news of the past week is of a confidential nature. Murray has asked L. to be his secretary if, as is possible, he is chosen to represent England on the League of Nations Committee at the Peace Conference. This would mean a visit to Paris. More than this need not be said; but it is an important possibility. Coming after it, the news that I today wrote the last words of my novel reads a little flat. Five hundred & thirty eight pages!
