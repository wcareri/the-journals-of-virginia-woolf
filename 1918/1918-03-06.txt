Again one has to wonder why the women comeâ€”what inducement there is in such a passive employment as sitting silent, half asleep, in a chair for an hour. Nick was in the right style for them too; simple, detailed, casual, much at his ease. He spoke for an hour. The thing that remains in my mind of the lecture is the waiting for trains, & the marching out â€œwith moon & stars looking very cynicalâ€ he said, along perfectly straight roads lined with poplars. His matter of fact way of speaking, as if necessity must be borneâ€”however outrageous to his sense of decency & common sense also struck me. He seemed in good spirits; proud of Barbara; telling us of her conquests, which he believes in implicitly; talking more than usual, & telling me how after the war theyâ€™d like to live in the country & make good furniture after designs by Carrington. Heâ€™s a human being of very good nature without special gifts to bend him this way or that; the same is true of her, I think. Its a rare production in our particular circle. L. to a meeting; we now have a mania for gambling over Demon patience. I lost 4/ over this in a week. Impudent letter came from Williams, about L.â€™s book. He is showing, or means to show, the doubtful passage to co-operators, & therefore canâ€™t start printing yet. L. now threatens to â€˜put the matter in the hands of his lawyersâ€™!
