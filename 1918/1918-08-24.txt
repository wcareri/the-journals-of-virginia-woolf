### Saturday 24 August

I had to look carefully before I wrote Saturday; stranger still one wonâ€™t know that its Sunday tomorrow, I suppose. If I werenâ€™t too lazy I think I should try to describe the country; but then I shouldnâ€™t get it right. I shouldnâ€™t bring back to my own eyes the look of all those old beautiful very worn carpets which are spread over the lower slopes of the hills; nor should I convey the look of clouded emerald which the downs wear, the semi-transparent look, as the sun & shadows change, & the green becomes now vivid now opaque. However I confess that I shirk almost equally the task which has accumulated for 7 days of describing our visitors. They are with us for another week, so I need not try to hit them this very moment. Bridge has broken down the partition between our sitting rooms. L. is playing at this moment, 5.40, binding himself to stop at 6; but it is doubtful if he will. I hesitate a little to write evil of my guests, nor do I think evilâ€”exactly. I refer, in rather crablike fashion, to something coarse, material, insensitive about Karin. One would never find much interest in her; though nothing despicable or mean. No: but sheâ€™s a capable American, who will get all that can be had for the asking; & nothing that canâ€™t. I have a theory that if one sense fails another does double work; she eats enormously. She has no concealed vices. Would she be more interesting if she had? She is not stupid; or dull; or trivial; on the contrary she is bright, capable & stirring: stirring Adrian to read books upon economics, & even stirring him to learn shorthand which according to her is useful in a literary career. She intends him to have a career. At any rate she is going to ask for that, too; for certainly Adrian will never ask for anything for himself. Yet (I confess it is â€œyetâ€ to me) he is happy; gives one the sense of being well provided for, as he provides her with good manners, good looks, & good taste. I feel myself frightfully superior, so refined as to be almost apologetic to Leonard; so full of fine feelings, subâ tle perceptions, intellectual tastes & the rest that I almost blush to sit here alone, writing or reading Milton. She informs me that I with my tastes would have much in common with Hope Mirrlees; â€œwith my tastesâ€ indeed! This account emphasises our points of difference; outwardly we are all good friends, talkative & in agreement, & not relying on gossip merely to despatch dinner with. We talk about the Labour party, & politics, & anarchy, & government. She understands an argument, deals with an article manfullyâ€”And in her way sheâ€™s a nice honest creature, not so sure of herself when it comes to taste; & knowing it tooâ€”though taste has led her, alas, to embroider a pair of shoes which A. obediently wears. I must leave what I have to say about Milton, the German prisoners, life, & other subjects for next time.
