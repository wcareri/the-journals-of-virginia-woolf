### Sunday 6 January

An infernal wet day. I left L. at the station, he having to go to Hampstead to answer a list of questions for Margaret. Home to tea alone. Alix & Fredegond for supper. The talk, after flaunting round Clive, Barbara, Garsington &c. settled upon conscience: social duties, & Tolstoy. Gerald (Shove) read Tolstoy the other day, & determined to give up tobacco, but now argues that Tolstoyâ€™s commands were for men of looser life than he, so that he may smoke cigarettes. He thinks seriously of starting a nursery garden after the war, & threatens to give up their capital.

â€œWhatâ€™s the use of that? L. demanded. Thats the worst of all things to do. We dont want people to live on 30/ a week.â€  
â€œPsychologically it may be necessary if one is to abolish capitalismâ€ I remarked.  
â€œI dont agree.â€ said Alix. â€œBesides who would he give his capital to?â€  
â€œIn the ideal state everyone would have Â£300 a yearâ€ L. went on.  
â€œPlease tell me some reason that I can remember to take back to Geraldâ€ Fredegond pleaded.

I forget now what the reason was.

â€œHeâ€™s got an awful conscience, she continued. He ate a large Christmas dinner, & then he & his brother sent out for preserved fruit & when they had finished them they were miserable. â€œWeâ€™ve behaved like pigs! Weâ€™re brutes!â€ they cried. They were both miserable.â€ L. gave us a great many reasons why we should keep what we have, & do good work for nothing; I still feel, however, that my fire is too large for one person. Iâ€™m one of those who are hampered by the psychological hindrance of owning capital. Alix represented some sturdy & hardheaded economy, derived from Stracheyâ€™s. After this long argument, it was time for them to go.
