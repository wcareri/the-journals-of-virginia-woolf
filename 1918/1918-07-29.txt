### Monday 29 July

Iâ€™m paralysed by the task of describing a week end at Garsington. I suppose we spoke some million words between us; listened to a great many more, chiefly from the mouth of Mrs Hamilton, who strains at her collar like a spaniel dog, & has indeed the large hazel staring eyes of one of them. There was Gertler; Shearman & Dallas for tea; Brett. Ottoline, 3 children & Philip. The string which united everything from first to last was Philipâ€™s attack upon Murry in The Nation for his review of Sassoon. He was half proud of himself & half uncomfortable; at any rate, I was taxed with being on Murryâ€™s side before 10 minutes was out; & then to prove his case Philip read Murryâ€™s article, his letter, & his letter to Murry, three times over, so I thought, emphasising his points, & lifting his finger to make us attend. And there was Sassoonâ€™s letter of gratitude too. I think Ott. was a little bored. Happily the weather was fine, the food good, & we flowed about happily enough, & without serious boredom, which is more than one can ask of a week-end. In fact, for some reason I was rather well content. My bed was like layer upon layer of the most springy turf; & then the garden is almost melodramatically perfect, with its grey oblong pool, & pink farm buildings, its soft whitish grey stone & enormous smooth dense green yew hedges. Down these paths we wandered; once or twice with Ott.; once with Mrs Hamilton. She is a working brain worker. Hasnâ€™t a penny of her own; & has the anxious hard working brain of a professional, earning her living all the time. Iâ€™m not sure though that she didnâ€™t compare very well with Ott. Some time after tea we three meandered off â€œto the woodsâ€. But we never got there of course. Ott. sat upon a gate very soon & discussed the character of Ly Margaret Sackville; & as usual Ott. deplored & marvelled at the very characteristics which, one would have said, she knew at first hand. However, her drift is always almost bewilderingly meandering; & I believe she often doesnâ€™t know her own motives for taking a special line. The difficulty is that anyone listening perceives some motive unconfessed; & this gives her talk rather a distracting wearying effect. Halfway up a hill in the sun, she stopped, leant on her parasol, looked vaguely across the landscape, & began a discourse upon love. Some wind seems to blow half her words awayâ€”another reason for finding her difficult to listen toâ€”

â€œIsnâ€™t it sad that no one really falls in love nowadays? Its the rarest, rarest thingâ€”I mean they dont see each other ideally. They dont feel that every word is something too wonderful just because the other has spoken it. Bertie does of courseâ€”but then his choice is so often unfortunate.â€

Here, chiefly in order to get us home, I said that love meant a great many different things; & that to confine it to romantic love was absurd. I also maintained that one could love groups of people, & landscapes. Unluckily this remark led Ott. to lean on her parasol once more, & look longingly at a wheatfield.

â€œYes. I love thatâ€”just for itselfâ€”the curve of that wheatfield seems to me as divine as any human being. Iâ€™ve always been like that ever since I can remember. I love literature tooâ€”â€  
â€œI love quite absurd thingsâ€”the I.L.P. for instanceâ€, said Mrs Hamilton.

At last we got moving again, & we asked the poor old ninny why, with this passion for literature, she didnt write.

â€œAh, but Iâ€™ve no timeâ€”never any time. Besides, I have such wretched healthâ€”But the pleasure of creation, Virginia, must transcend all others.â€

I said it certainly did; though I think the remark ought to have been made to include Mrs Hamilton too. We trailed back through the village, where all the peasants were lounging in the road, with their pipes & their dogs & their babies. The most affable, & Iâ€™m afraid, obsequious greetings were exchanged; the dazzling appearance of Ott. & her pearls seeming to strike the agricultural labourer neither as wrong nor ridiculous, but as part of the aristocratic show that heâ€™d paid for. No one laughed. Old ladies in black were eager to stop & talk about the hot weather. They seemed all a little excited & very anxious to please. â€œVery nice people, arenâ€™t they?â€ she said when we came in; & I daresay nothing for the next 300 years will make them otherwise.

I was taken to Gertlerâ€™s studio & shown his solid â€˜unrelentingâ€™ teapot (to use Brettâ€™s word). He is a resolute young man; & if good pictures can be made by willing them to be good, he may do wonders. No base motive could have its way with him; & for this reason I havenâ€™t great faith in him. Its too moral & intellectual an affair; or perhaps the natural gift is not abundant enough to cover his conscience & will power. He says straight out what he thinks, sits very upright; everything tight curled, tense, muscular about him; his art an agony often, as he told me. But at last he understands that he wishes to paint form in the brightest colours. Form obsesses him. He sees a lamp as an imminent dominant overwhelming mass of matter. Ever since he was a child the solidity & the shapes of objects have tortured him. I advised him, for arts sake, to keep sane; to grasp, & not exaggerate, & put sheets of glass between him & his matter. This, so he said, is now his private wish. But he can think pianola music equal to hand made, since it shows the form, & the touch & the expression are nothing.
