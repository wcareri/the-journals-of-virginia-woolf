### Tuesday 2 July

My hand shakes no longer, but my mind vibrates uncomfortably, as it always does after an incursion of visitors; unexpected, & slightly unsympathetic. Oneâ€™s talked nonsense; oneâ€™s ashamed; theyâ€™ve been uncomfortable; the contact of one with the other was difficult. I was reading Macaulayâ€™s Life over my tea. (L. seeing Snowden in London) when Mrs Woolf was announced. Edgar & Sylvia called in on their way through Richmond. He is a good deal nicer than she is; as I think Iâ€™ve recorded earlier in this book, I take her to be as near the average of her sex, class, & age as may be; given Putney as birthplace, & middle class origin & rather moderate means. The great machine turns out millions like her every year. However they are supplied with a number of ready made remarks into the bargain, so we talked away our 20 minutes,â€”& now they are gone. But what led him to marry her? â€œMy dear boyâ€ she calls him. I started folding K.M.â€™s story this afternoon; & went round to the printers, who will only give half a promise to have his press free tomorrow. Every conceivable obstacle is flung across our road, though we do our best to come out this next week. Influenza, which rages all over the place, has come next door.
