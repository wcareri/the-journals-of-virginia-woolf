In the absence of human interest, which makes us peaceful & content, one may as well go on with Byron. Having indicated that I am ready, after a century, to fall in love with him, I suppose my judgment of Don Juan may be partial. It is the most readable poem of its length ever written, I suppose; a quality which it owes in part to the springy random haphazard galloping nature of its method. This method is a discovery by itself. Its what one has looked for in vainâ€”aâ n elastic shape which will hold whatever you choose to put into it. Thus he could write out his mood as it came to him; he could say whatever came into his head. He wasnâ€™t committed to be poetical; & thus escaped his evil genius of the false romantic & imaginative. When he is serious he is sincere; & he can impinge upon any subject he likes. He writes 16 cantoâ€™s without once flogging his flanks. He had, evidently, the able witty mind of what my father Sir Leslie would have called a thoroughly masculine nature. I maintain that these illicit kind of books are far more interesting than the proper books which respect illusions devoutly all the time. Still, it doesnâ€™t seem an easy example to follow; & indeed like all free & easy things, only the skilled & mature really bring them off successfully. But Byron was full of ideasâ€”a quality that gives his verse a toughness, & drives me to little excursions over the surrounding landscape or room in the middle of my reading. And tonight I shall have the pleasure of finishing himâ€”though why, considering that Iâ€™ve enjoyed almost every stanza, this should be a pleasure I really dont know. But so it always is, whether the books a good book or a bad book. Maynard Keynes admitted in the same way that he always cuts off the advertisements at the end with one hand while heâ€™s reading, so as to know exactly how much he has to get through.

Everyone so far has failed us: Katherine ill: Ka & Will A.F. obliged to work next Sunday; so, in a wild desire to couple Bonwick with someone who will mitigate his tedium, weâ€™ve wired both to Marjorie Strachey & Mrs Hamilton. Rather wickedly I dwelt to Marjorie, upon the fair hair of B. but she has drawn it upon herself by her confession, or rather statement, that she intends to marry.
