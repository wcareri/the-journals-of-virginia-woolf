### Thursday 10 January

Our pipes burst yesterday in the sudden thaw. From sharp frost we changed in an hour or two to mildness. Lâ (ottie). & Nâ (elly). dealt with this sensibly, but we are without baths. Set up in the afternoon, then to the printers. L. did not lose his temper; little MacDermott asserts that there was a verbal understanding that he need only deliver the press if his was put up. So mild, pertinacious, & muddle headed that we made no impression. The truth is he takes us for amateurs, who neednâ€™t be treated seriously. We are to think things over.
