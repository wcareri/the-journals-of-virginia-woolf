Here I am experimenting with the parent of all pensâ€”the black J. the pen, as I used to think it, along with other objects, as a child, because mother used it; & therefore all other pens were varieties & eccentricities. What I have to record with it is the cheerful news that I am once more in hot waterâ€”this time owing to Gertler,â€”Monty Shearmanâ€”Maryâ€”Cliveâ€”Vanessa;â€”who exploded upon my head with reproaches for having almost brought her to disaster. My conscience is clear; but Iâ€™m coming to think that friendships maintained in this atmosphere are altogether too sharp, brittle, & painful. I have written to Charleston to this effect. If I could have letters from Mary & Clive I should feel myself rewarded. L. is down at Tidmarsh, & I write to relieve myself of the feeling which comes over me in his absence of being a besieged city.

We had a day in London yesterdayâ€”somehow the charm of those days is not quite what it was. Am I getting blasÃ©â€”is the 17 Club less enthralling? We went to the Omega show, met Roger, were invited to tea at his studio, discussed the change in Duncanâ€™s style, his fatherâ€™s burial, half Church of England, half Quaker, representation, reality, & so on again, Waley coming in as we left. We dined at a very hot place in Soho, where you have perhaps a stoneâ€™s weight of food given you for 2/3. On again to the Club, where Leonard made his speech about Austria Hungary. As usual I find him not only very clear but with the right degree of passion to be interesting. The audience, as usual at the 17 Club, seemed made of curiosities whose aberrations of feature had driven them up & up the backwaters of life, where they dwell in semi obscurity, only issuing from their huts to plant arrows in the sides of the sleek town dwellers. If it werenâ€™t so ugly, it might be picturesque. Or is it merely that the body resents much use of the brain?
