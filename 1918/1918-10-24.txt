### Thursday 24 October

The degradation of steel pens is such that after doing my best to clip & file one into shape, I have to take to a Waterman fountain pen, profoundly though I distrust them, & disbelieve in their capacity to convey the nobler & profounder thoughts. Yes, I can speak of myself with more confidence today as noble & profound; I am capable of standing for Parliament & holding office, & becoming just like Herbert Fisher perhaps. To me the vote was as surprising as to some retired cleric in the vales of Westmorland, who will see in it the death knell of liberty, I daresay, & preach a sermon to that effect next Sunday. Then the great lady at Stocks must be feeling uncomfortable, though I am malicious enough to suppose that if by some process of selection she alone could represent Belgravia in the House of Lords, the change would not seem so devastating. Imagine her neatly accoutred in black trousers (so my imagination sees her) upon the bench at the Hague Conference! Her book, the reviews say, lays emphasis upon the fact that her novels were once thought beauties.

We are just in from Kingstonâ€”today being a holiday, L. not going up to London, & printing not started. McDermott is generally invisible, & when we caught him was just going out â€œpartly in your interests, I may sayâ€, & threw out ominous hints as to the decline of his business, which threatens our seven pounds, so we imagine (back again to the superior fluency & cogency of steel). However, having walked across Bushy Park, & heard a stag grating his throat in a very surly manner, his doe being couchant by his side, we took tram to Kingston & there heard the paper boys shouting out about the Presidentâ€™s message, which we bought & devoured in the train. The main points are that he is keeping negotiations going, though the Times came out with a great headline â€œNo parleyâ€ this morning. He discriminates too, between the German people & the Kaiser; he will consider an armistice with the one but only complete surrender with the other. Anyhow, the question is now laid before England & France; & so another step in the tedious business is begun.

Privately our minds are exercised about the question of going to Tidmarsh on Sunday. Lytton wired to beg us to yesterday, saying â€œdesolation extremeâ€. The difficulties are the nuisance of moving; work to be done; Herbert & his Freda dining here on Sunday. Yes, Herbert has been accepted by a certain Miss Freda Majorâ€”who she is or what she is, except that she is reported very active, I do not know.
