### Monday 4 November

Since Iâ€™m back from the Club & waiting for L. (who has gone to see Mr Hawkins of the Temple) I had better assuage my fretfulness with pen & ink. I have a pen of malachite vulcanite(?) which perhaps serves the purpose of a babies coral. Iâ€™ve had no letter from Charleston which makes me feel rather sent to Coventry, though I suppose communications are going on between Clive & Mary; & then I canâ€™t help fancying that Janetâ€™s chill falling upon the last pages of my novel still depresses me. The depression however now takes the wholesome form of feeling perfectly certain that nothing I can do matters, so that one is both content & irresponsibleâ€”Iâ€™m not sure that this isnâ€™t a happier state than the exalted state of the newly praised. At least one has nothing to fear, & the sheer pleasure of writing seems singularly unalloyed. It proves itself so genuine that no amount of Hampstead cold water can impair it. Praise? fame? Janetâ€™s good opinion? How beside the mark they all are!

I keep thinking of different ways to manage my scenes; conceiving endless possibilities; seeing life, as I walk about the streets, an immense opaque block of material to be conveyed by me into its equivalent of language. (Lottieâ€™s fire has to be nursed like a dying kittenâ€”its my fire now, herâ€™s being dead of course, & Iâ€™ve taken 25 minutes to get a trickle of flame between the coals.) In the intervals Iâ€™ve been thinking a good deal about this melancholy state of impending age. From the way Janet took certain remarks of mine about 60 as an age limit (for the Webbs) I felt that she took age to be a shameful disease that one shrank from hearing named. At anyrate, it is obvious that she must think about it privately, not facing it, turning away from it. And then it seems as if she were now always playing for safety. She has a kind of personal resentment against anyone, like Lytton for example, who laughs at what she holds sacred; she falls into the insidious trap of believing that any departure from the great is ephemeral & impertinent; & she argues this with personal feeling as if her own reputation depended on theirs. And all the time sheâ€™s so anxious to be in the front, to share what the young feel. But if I represent the young, my feelings tend to develop on such different lines that I can only wave my hand over leagues of Sea.

To Souhamiâ€™s; Mudies & the Club.
