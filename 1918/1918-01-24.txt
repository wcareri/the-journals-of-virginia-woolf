### Thursday 24 January

The last day of being 35. One trembles to write the years that come after it: all tinged with the shadow of 40. Another spring day; I do without a fire in the morning. The only drawback is the loss of a fire, & that sense of being in a cave of comfort, with wet & dark outside. Outside its a pale grey. I went to the (London) Library to get a handful of stories on the supernatural; met Sir Henry Newbolt, a slim greyheaded weasel, but we didnâ€™t know each other; then I beat up & down Charing Cross Rd. asking for Keatsâ€™ Letters, but they were not to be had anywhere. So to the Club, where I found Lytton by himself, & not feeling inclined for talk we read our papers near together. Fredegond came in; but after laughing a little at her telephone message, I went. She & Alix & Carrington getting together decided that I criticised them, wouldnâ€™t stand it, rang me up, demanded a retraction, which I would only give if they put their complaints in writing: Iâ€™m afraid they wont do this. They say I depress them, & the only explanation is that Iâ€™m a Saddhist. This is the first turn of the worm. Barbara, however, lets all criticism run off her without a trace. L. printed 4 pages off at the printers today, & only got back at 6 an unsatisfactory job, owing to the incompetence of the printer.
