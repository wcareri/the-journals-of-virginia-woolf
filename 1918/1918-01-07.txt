His mild benignancy with the young ladiesâ€”Fredegond, Faith & Alix, very noticeable. I told him he wrote too much after the pattern of Macaulay.

â€œI see you didnâ€™t really like Gordonâ€ he said.

He was quite unmoved, contented, almost sleek. People going in & out all the time make it difficult to talk. Chief topic the approach of peace; save that the evening papers throw doubts upon it.
