### Sunday 3 November

On Friday night I went up to dine with the Arnold Forsters, partly I own, to avoid Mr Seymour Coxâ€™s lecture upon the Secret Treaties, since I thought I knew already what Mr Seymour Cocks would say. Ka & Will live just past the Spectator office in the little semicircle of houses standing off the road, but tolerably noisy nevertheless. Here he lived before his marriage. He looked unusually small, drawn & pallid, like a face seen under a gas lamp, owing to his disease; & no longer young. He reminds me rather of one of those old ladies, who have yellow hair & very pink cheeks, but you can count their years in the way the flesh is drawn tight across the bone, & crinkled with very delicate fine lines. His person & manners are against him. He makes an impression of being very sharp, rather fretful, & acid. I think all this is largely due to his peevish voice, & little angular body, which he jerks about when he gets excited, & very little makes him emphatic. Nor did I like the pale acid decorations of the roomâ€”the lavender walls, & the one white rose drooping against them; nor did I like his niggled & emotional picture of the downs. There seemed a lack of warmth, depth, & substance. Perhaps none of this very much matters. His principles are those of the modern husbandâ€”freedom & independence for the wifeâ€”equal pleasures. Principles matter too. Ka will be happy with him. We talked very briskly. I dont think I should like his taste in books; I donâ€™t like his slang; or his admirations; but I liked his excitement over the war office gazette. I suspect he has an able excitable rather febrile mind, which, on principle, has taken to painting pictures; I could wager my own head full of brains that heâ€™ll never paint a good one.

On Saturday, we had one of our Hampstead afternoons, L. going to Margaret, I to Janet. Iâ€™ve done the same thing so often. Iâ€™ve found her in that green distempered room, with the ugly pictures. How well I know the benevolent look of the late Mr Case as a young man, drawn upon yellow paper & very slightly tinted on the cheeks, larger than life, framed in gold, by the late Mr Richmond. I know the photographs of young soldiers, & the silhouettes, & Janetâ€™s books, which never seem to be read, & the greek dictionary with the piece of paper sticking out of it. Then theres Diana who takes up a lot of attention; but is now a reformed character. Emphie vagulates in & out of the room. Tea is prepared. I am pressed to eat more of everything. Questioned about butter & coal. Yesterday Emphie had a new kind of methylated spirits to show me, which you can only get in Highgate. Mr Marshall rather varied the proceedingsâ€”a well kept middle aged gentleman of Hampstead who proclaimed his wish to rule the world; & his fear lest America should rule it instead. Here was a Times leading article in the flesh. But he was also a chatty old gossip; & he & Emphie had noticed so many houses unlit, newcomers who were almost unknown, trees that wanted lopping, motor cars waiting for Mr Galsworthy, preparations for opening the Y.M.C.A., that it was like Cranford, to listen. And then they went & Janet talked to me about literature, & I fell into a passing gloom. She says that a great many novels are written, & it seems fairly evident that none are â€œimmortalâ€. I suppose I referred this to my own novels; indeed, she urged me to write a biography for Basil Williams. But I fancy that what depressed me was not only the personal question, but the smell of musty morality. None of us came up to the scratchâ€”not Lytton or Forster or anyone; but I felt beyond this fairly safe criticism the depressing effect of talking to some one who seems to want all literature to go into the pulpit; who makes it all infinitely worthy & safe & respectable. I was led into trying to define my own particular searchâ€”not after morality, or beauty or realityâ€”no; but after literature itself; & this made Janet a little anxious & insistent, as if, conceivably, she might have missed something. Where did I find it? How did I explain it? We agreed upon a certain passage in Sophocles; but as she capped this with one in Lear, I think we were talking of different things. And she pressed me to tell her what I meant; & of course I came nowhere near it, & at length she said that she thought she was beginning to find what I meantâ€”after all these years of reading Greek! Yes, I was depressed at her age, at something unstable about her; but I was also depressed at the implied criticism of The Voyage Out, & at the hint that I had better turn to something other than fiction. Now this seems to me foolish, & I wish I could make up a cure for it, to be taken after such encounters, which are bound to happen every month of oneâ€™s life. Its the curse of a writers life to want praise so much, & be so cast down by blame, or indifference. The only sensible course is to remember that writing is after all what one does best; that any other work would seem to me a waste of life; that on the whole I get infinite pleasure from it; that I make one hundred pounds a year; & that some people like what I write. But Janet would only admit that love counted, & said that her friends had succeeded only in â€œcoming offâ€ in life, not in art.
