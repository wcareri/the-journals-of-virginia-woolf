### Saturday 6 April

This morning I had a letter from Barbara telling me that Nick was dangerously wounded on the 30th. The wound is in the back & kidneys, & they have operated. The last news said he was well through the operation. They have heard no more. If he recovers, perhaps he wonâ€™t be sent out againâ€”but who knows? At least she has had the blow soon, & if it were me, I should think that a blessing in itself. But the state of waiting for telegrams & letters, without any certainty when theyâ€™ll come, & this baby in prospect, must be as fair a combination of torture as human beings can invent for each other. However, Saxon is moving house; she helps him; his voice on the telephone sounded as if pleasure of some sort had not entirely deserted him. But when a crisis happens, scarcely anyone meets it naturally; either theyâ€™re too composed & prosaic, or the other extreme. Saxon has a curious cul de sac of his own.

Rain all day till this moment, when it has turned brilliant. Plum in blossom in the garden, & flowers very healthy looking. To turn over books in Hiskokeâ€™s. I bought Collinsâ€™ poems & Colley Cibberâ€™s Autobiographyâ€”1/ both together. L. to Staines. Floraâ€™s husband has just gone abroad.
