### Monday 1 July

Just back from tea at the Club, laden with 2 cloths had on approval from Souhamiâ€™s. L. at the League of Nations. Weâ€™ve talked a great deal since I wrote last. First there was the party at the Club on Friday. I came late & met Lytton first & then little Sanger with his name written & pinned to his buttonhole. All sorts of people one half knew from the papersâ€”men with shaggy hair & great eyebrowsâ€”women cadaverous or flamboyantâ€”Macdonald, Huysmans, Mrs Despard, Thomas & so on. I was pitched strangely enough into the arms of Widow Creighton who remembered me, she said. Age perhaps has toned her dogmatism. I found her easy enough; a sincere fine old thing, her face emerging out of a mist of flesh, & looking infinitely seamed & worn, like an immensely old sun shining through the mists. She said middle age was happier than youth. I was shot on again. We dined with A. & K.: a good dinner downstairs, & then sat by their open window looking on to Parliament Hill. At 9 we went on to Rayâ€™s partyâ€”a dull affair, neither respectable nor bohemian, inundated with Belgians. I talked to Jack (Hills) however; very much like our version of himâ€”emphatic, sententious, & very trusty & kind. I felt him pathetic too; so much seems to have gone wrong for him. On Saturday I went to tea with Janetâ€”but my hand shakes so with carrying parcels that I canâ€™t write.
