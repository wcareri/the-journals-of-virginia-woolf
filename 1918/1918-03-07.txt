### Thursday 7 March

In these 2 days Iâ€™ve â€˜dissedâ€™ 4 pages, in the hope that we may finish 8 pages of the story before we go away again. The raids seem so distant now that this precaution seems excessive. The servants still sleep in the kitchen however, as a shadow of moon remains. Philip came after lunch, & he & L. walked to Kew. I met them on the towing path. He is obviously very wretched; has no future wishes evidently, save to get out to France. He brought some of Cecilâ€™s poems, which we have offered to print at once, in a small book, in our old typeâ€”As giving him occupation it would be a good thing to do. & he offers to come & help. The more one sees of the effects on young men who should be happy the more one detests the whole thing. Philip takes more interest in the military side of it than Nick, I think. He has refused an offer to work in London. A bitter day, & our coal finished tomorrow. The last raid dropped a bomb on the coal merchants.
