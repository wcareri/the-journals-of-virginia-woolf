### Friday 19 April

A day of gigantic effort for L. Eight pages printed it off. He went at 1.30 & is still (6 p.m.) at the printers, standing in the cellar & slipping page after page between the pins, having had only a short time off for tea. By tonight I shall have 8 pages to diss. & then to set up; though the type runs to 9 pages, 3 lines with the new hâ€™s: t being the one to give out at last. Snow, storms of wind, bitter cold, & occasional sunshine.
