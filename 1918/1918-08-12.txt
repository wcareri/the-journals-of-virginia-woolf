### Monday 12 August

(I believe this is near about the anniversary of our wedding day, 6 years ago). Bonwick came; but Marjorie & Mrs Hamilton only sent telegrams. Being a man of business he made the most of his holiday, & came toiling up the hill to find us, where we were picking blackberries. A straight commonplace rigid kind of man; impervious to anything at all different from the usual. Going down the hill he told us that he spent a fifth of his income on Prisoners of War, in order to justify his exemption as a C.O. Our talk was almost wholly about The Nation. It was his only topic. The poor man has a strong Cockney accent; a perservering aspiring selfsatisfied mind, making great play with his literary connections, & pretending to be the most important part of â€œWeâ€ when he speaks, as he always does, of the Nation. To tell the truth, I got my first inkling of the lure of gold through hearing him talk. He gave out that he deals in hundreds & thousands. They are Rowntreeâ€™s hundreds & thousands, but Mr B. has the easy powerful air of one who deals in them. â€œRowntree asked me if the Nation could afford it (1000 a year) & I said yes. So he did itâ€”Yes, we pay our writers increased rates now. Hobson chanced to say that he had never made so little by the Nation, so I told Rowntree the fees ought to be raised.â€ I imagine him sitting at a desk in an ante room & opening the door for people who want to see Massingham. He told us that Mrs Phillimore has been offered Â£500 for a book of her religious sketches. He told us lots of gossip, how Edward Garnett was turned out; & how they got scores of letters against Rogerâ€™s articles; & madmen write to them â€œI am the son of Godâ€. But I was more impressed by his commercial bearing than by his anecdotes. He told them a little as if he were superior to all these literary peopleâ€”(but I confess that the mosquitoes are biting my toes, & a moth is dropping perpetually from the lamp, so that I canâ€™t remember all the things I meant to say about Mr Bonwick. Leonard is staying with him at â€œmy placeâ€ near Croydon tonight, & goes tomorrow to York to see Rowntree. L. declares that the profound psychologist would find B. chiefly remarkable for a complete lack of humour.
