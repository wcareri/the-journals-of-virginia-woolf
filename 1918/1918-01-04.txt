### Friday 4 January

Thereâ€™s no reason after all why one should expect special events for the first page of a new book; still one does: & so I may count three facts of different importance; our first use of the 17 Club; talk of peace; & the breaking of my tortoiseshell spectacles. This talk of peace (after all the most important of the three) comes to the surface with a kind of tremor of hope once in 3 months; then subsides; then swells again. What it now amounts to, one doesnâ€™t even like to guess, having a sort of superstition about guessing; at any rate, one canâ€™t help feeling something moving; one may wake to find the covered murmur proclaimed in every newspaper. The 17 Club is a success, on the basis of one tea. We met Alix, settled in, already an habituÃ© by the fire; together with a knot of very youthful revolutionaries, one officer, & two sallow democratic officials. The rooms are light, bear traces of Omega, & are less formal than usual. Before this, I did my usual round; Partridge & Coopers; walk through Lincolns Inn Fields to Mudies; L. passing his afternoon in Committees. Margaret has just rung up to consult him on certain peace maneuvres in which she figures. Talk with Alix about possible books she might write: â€œOneâ€™s wretched without workâ€â€”â€œOh, perfectly wretchedâ€ she echoed, with a glance in the direction of James, I suppose. â€œNo hope of writing well: I see things as they are.â€
