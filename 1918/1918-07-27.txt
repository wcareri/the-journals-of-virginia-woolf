### Saturday 27 July

As usual, this diary has skipped a day or two. But first one must pause to say that here a new volume starts, the third, & therefore there is every appearance of a long, though intermittent life. If it survives the summer, when the evenings are unfavourable to writing, it should flourish in the winter. Perhaps the lack of coal may kill it. We may have to live entirely at the 17 Club. But to look ahead is disastrous, considering how much has still to be recorded of time past. On Wednesday, I had one of my field days. To London, first to meet James at the Club. He was to tell me about Rupert for my article. His first words however were, â€œHave you heard of Kaâ€™s engagement?â€ â€œTo Hilton?â€ I asked. â€œNo, to Arnold Forster.â€ This annoyed me considerably. I am glad that she should marry, though she bade fair to be a marked spinster, but marriage with W.A.F. will be merely a decorous & sympathetic alliance, making her more of a servant of the state than ever. Then, as James had a medical examination, we couldnâ€™t say much about Rupert, save that he was jealous, moody, ill-balanced, all of which I knew, but can hardly say in writing. Fredegond appeared next; I took her half way to Charing Cross. She had been having confidences from Alix, & was in the flood of affection for her. These emotions are too much in the Fisher spirit for my comfort. Her poems are soon coming out. Then, having spread my rumour about Ka, which only comes through Bob, through a letter from A.F. & thus may not be true, & I hope it isnâ€™t, I went up to Gordon Sqre; where the vans were taking the furniture, Nessa in & out of the room all the time; & of course Clive & Mary appeared; & then everything goes over the same little rapids. We all dined at the Mont Blanc. Clive has never forgiven meâ€”for what? I see that he is carefully following a plan in his relations with meâ€”& resents any attempt to distract him from it. His personal remarks always seem to be founded on some reserve of grievance, which he has decided not to state openly.

â€œYouâ€™ve wrecked one of my best friendshipsâ€ he remarked; â€œby your habit of describing facts from your own standpointâ€”â€  
â€œWhat you call Godâ€™s Truthâ€ said Nessa.  
â€œOne couldnâ€™t have an intimacy with you & anyone else at the same timeâ€”You describe people as I paint pots.â€  
â€œYou put things in curl, & they come out afterwardsâ€ Mary murmured from the shadow of her sympathetic silence.

Clive however had bitterness of some sort in what he said. He meant me to see that somehow I had ended our old relationsâ€”& now all is second best. It was clear also that he lives in dread of some alliance between Mary & me which shall threaten his position with her. He protested that to show her letters of his would be unfair, on my part or on Nessaâ€™s. She is a blank book after our much written, rewritten & scratched out torn out pages. The situation is complicated & delicate enough. He canâ€™t make up his mind to cut adrift from me altogether. But he paid for my dinner, & we wound up good temperedly. The rain pelted down, & I rushed for my train. I wish I had had the patience to write down the more intelligent parts of our talk: criticism of books & life, & not of people & feelings. But I become too critical of badly written criticism, & write so hurriedly that it would certainly be bad.

On Thursday we had a day off; in which we glued some more copies of Prelude; I think only one more order has come in. People complain that though clever & all that, the story isnâ€™t complete.

On Friday, 26th, L. went on his round of League of Nations, & Club. I to Omega for Rogerâ€™s new paper, to Gordon Sqre for pictures, & then, laden intolerably, to the Club for tea. By rights of importance I should remark that today L. was asked to stand for Parliament. I havenâ€™t yet turned my mind that way. A natural disposition to think Parliament ridiculous routs serious thought. But perhaps it isâ€™nt so ridiculous as speeches make one suppose. Journalists were given tea at the Club. I went upstairs, hid behind a door, & saw Mrs Hamilton for the first time, or rather heard her, holding forth like a jolly club man; for I didnâ€™t dare look.

James to dinner. He promises to send us Rupertâ€™s letters to typewrite at Asheham; but some queer Strachey intrigue is at work on the matter.
