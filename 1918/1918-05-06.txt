### Monday 6 May

L. was so uncomfortable this morning that we went out at eleven, for it was sunny & beautiful, the wind being in the East. We meant to sit in Kew Gardens, but they donâ€™t open till 12: & therefore we sat on Kew Green, which has been turned into allotment gardens: ugly patches of raw earth, spotted with white paper stuck into sticks. At twelve we entered. To the general loveliness & freshness was added a sense of being out when we should have been at home; this always turns things into a kind of spectacle. It seems to be going on without you. We sat under a tree, & became a centre for sparrows & robins, & pestered by the attentions of a gigantic aeroplane.

L. went to Harrisonâ€™s, & had his tooth out, for it was very bad & pouring poison into him, sufficient to cause many headaches, so Harrison said. I went to London on my usual round; the one I like best. In my beatific state I forgot the principle thing Iâ€™d gone for; a typewriter ribbon; but never mind; that will be another days treat. Mudieâ€™s I dont altogether like because Iâ€™m kept waiting, but I love Holborn, & the Charing Cross Road, & I rather like turning into the 17 Club, & finding or expecting to find someone I want to talk to. I dont like buying hats though: though Iâ€™ve conquered some part of the horror by learning how to look into the eyes of milliners, & make my demands boldly. Eighteen shillings for a hat seems a great price; but I paid it; & it relieves me so much to have bought it that Iâ€™m happy again in the end. But what womenâ€™s faces in the streets! As senseless as playing cards; with tongues like adders. I found James reading the Antigone in the Club. Presently Leonard came, with Adrian. Adrian looks immensely long, & his little bow tie somehow gives him a frivolous rather than distinguished air, as if a butterfly had settled on him by mistake. He has some job in an office. We gossiped. Blood is a very strong tie; so much can be taken for granted, after the first shyness. Then Barbara came in, in her round black hat with the cherry coloured ribbon, as neat as if sheâ€™d never been in France; but all the same I think she is a little different. Nick is in hospital, & very irritable. She spends her spare time with Saxon. I daresay the seesaw is not working quite smoothly; but one cant honestly deduce this from a shadow round her eyes! We went on to the London Library, & so home.
