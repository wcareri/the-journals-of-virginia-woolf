### Sunday 5 May

But when the wind turns to East, it pours. Such a spring I canâ€™t remember, though for blackness the summer I spent in bed at Twickenham matched it. According to Nessa the country has the same climate. This being so, we walked out in our mackintoshes, up the river & down the Avenue. Scarcely a couple to be seen. I pitied the orange barrows, half covered over, with some wet man sheltering near under a tree, his Sunday sales demolished. The tea gardens, too, look dishevelled, with their daffodils bent & drenched. Outside Dysart House we heard a cuckoo, inside some forlorn week end party was listening to a pianola. Desmond put us off, I confess to our relief; his mother burnt her face lighting a gas stove. L. was rather headachy, perhaps owing to a swollen tooth.
