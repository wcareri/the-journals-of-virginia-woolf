### Friday 26 April

There are five or six days missed outâ€”I donâ€™t remember why, but partly at least because there wasnâ€™t much to say. On Monday (22 April) I remember having tea at the Club & meeting Fredegond, Ermengard, a lady farmer & someone I took to be Bryn, but she answered to the name of Daphne. The Shoves are driven to the land again; had left it to the very last moment of course, & being under compact to have a job by Monday were still in doubt whether to try Cambridge, Hertford, or Hampshire. I talked mainly to Ermengardâ€”a rare visitor, but somehow familiar. As L. remarked these country women get a slow bovine manner, rather refreshing to my taste. She breeds prize bulls, plays a double bass in the evening, & writes improper stories for children. She seems to have settled into a corner absolutely fitted for her, where she exists pleasantly, having a Quaker faith now to round her off. I got the impression of some large garden flower comfortably shoving its roots about & well planted in the soilâ€”say a Stock, or a holly-hock.

On Tuesday (23 April) Wright dined & slept here. I listened with respect to a long conversation, in which both L. & he played their parts with perfect knowledge of the rules of the game. Such was the impression that their deliberate, easy & yet concise manner of speech made upon me. How far W. minded his fate it was difficult to say. The rules of the game require complete urbanity. He was extremely nice to play so well of course. He offered to help as much as he could. His opinion of his own powers as Editor being naturally higher than ours or indeed than the Trustees, this was very nice of him, but I expect thereâ€™s truth in his own saying that heâ€™d rather get what he wants done by others than do it himself. He labours under a variety of diseases, & is very deliberate, taking twice the time to finish a meal that we do, & perhaps 4 times as long to finish a sentence. The question of salaries was discussed. W. thinks this will be referred to him. He suggests from Â£200 to Â£250 for Miss Matthaei; between Â£300 & Â£400 for L. This is more than we expected. However it depends on more people than Wright (Eagle here rings up to say heâ€™s standing for Parliamentâ€”a labour candidateâ€”At that rate the Manx cat has a chance).

On Wednesday (24 April) Lottie spilt half a case of type on the floor, so that I had to spend 4 hours in sorting every compartmentâ€”about the most trying work there is. She had mixed the letters in thoroughly, thinking or hoping that though divided in compartments the letters were all the same.

On Thursday I was recumbent & L. went to do proofs at the office.

On Friday we set up, & took a short walk. The weather varies between fog & sunshine, saving us at least from raids, though the moon is full.
