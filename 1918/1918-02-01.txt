### Friday 1 February

A day of fog in patches. Last night the worst fog they say for 30 years, & old gents, who escaped the raid walked in numbers over the edge of platforms & were crushed. A cook stepped into the Thames; people walked by rapping our railings to keep the road. L. went to London & coming home at 10.30, reported a starry night & clear afternoon, the fog deep once more when night fell here.
