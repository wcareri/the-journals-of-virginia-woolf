### Monday 16 December

Back from a week end with Roger. Lips, therefore, rather sore with talk, though his range is so wide, & we both have such a number of things to say that I, certainly, was neither bored nor satiated. Pamela was there, very rounded, supple, with a likeness to some naked wood creature in an Italian picture; she has the yellow brown complexion too. I suspect that children take the shape of their parents the other way about; a vivacious sociable enthusiastic father produces a quiet, unselfish, rather passive daughter. She is only sixteen, but mature in manner, as the result of living with grown up people. It was polling day on Saturday in Guildford, as in other parts of the world, & Roger very gloomy about the future of the world. No doubt he will soon forget about politics. The war is already almost forgotten. All Sunday, in spite of rain & fog he painted till the sky was black, having been grey through the time of daylight. I feel little hope about his pictures, but had to counterfeit an opinion as to the effect produced on the solidity of a bowl by a mornings work on it. He said that he grudged every hour of daylight spent not painting, since age draws near, & he must say what he wants to say before he dies. Age he proposes to spend alone, working all day long. At last he seems to do what he has always tried to do. We had some melancholy revelations about the treachery of certain friends towards the Omega. Rogerâ€™s great point is that though superficially unbalanced & exaggerated his sense of balance is always right in the end; he is always magnanimous & forgiving, however much weight he may lay upon imaginary or semi-imaginary grievances. The Omega case is that his artists accept commissions independently of the Omega. For that & other reasons the poor shop has been a source of unmitigated disillusion to himâ€”a weariness & grievance. People hate art & him for loving it is now a frequent burden of his talk. Nor did I show myself one of the elect, with regard to painting at least. We visited the National Gallery together this morning; I thought a Rembrandt â€œvery fineâ€ which to him was mere melodrama. A little El Greco conveyed little until he illumined it; showed how it held more real colour than any other picture there. Then the Ingres was repulsive to me; & to him one of the most marvellous of designs. I always feel, too, that to like the wrong thing, or fail in sufficiently liking the right jars on him, like false notes, or sentimentality in writing.
