### Tuesday 10 December

Sunday was memorable to me for another visit to Shelley Houseâ€”where I actually shook hands with Miss Sands, Katie, & Elena Rathbone. All expressed great surprise at seeing me, as if I were a strange bird joining a flock of the same species. I felt strange enough; but oddly familiar with their ways after the first. Elena was almost like an old friendâ€”a very old friend who persists, remembering what went on before I took my dive & she hers. She pressed me, almost affectionately, to come & see them. I shall do it with misgivings. Suppose we have absolutely nothing to say? All her charming frank caressing manner may vanish. And then there is the eternal, & insoluble question of clothes. Katie rather ensanguined & flesh covered, but with a great dignity & amplitude of feature, sitting very up right, eyes half closed, in the front of the room, listening to Ravel & Schumann, which she said she admired equally.

On Monday I paid what has now become my weekly visit to Katherine. Murry was there; which makes it a little stiff, though I like them both, & her better as a wife. He scarcely speaks; makes one feel that most speaking is useless; but as he has a brain of his own I donâ€™t mind this. Besides it is more shyness than purpose. I told such stories as I could think of; Murry then explained that he had a confession to make. It only amounted to the fact that he has bought his brother a hand press, upon which some short poems of his are to be printed, beautifully, like Kelmscott books. Arthur is learning at a Polytechnic, & wishes to do â€˜artâ€™ printing. I rather suspect Arthurâ€™s views of art. But anyhow we are to do what we like with Murryâ€™s long poem. At present to give it McDermott seems the most feasible plan, when the great red posters are all issued, which have begun to paper Richmond during the past few days. â€œPayment, Punishmentâ€¦â€ & some other P. is the policy they advocate. We shall probably vote for no one. A wet day; but we went out having â€œpracticallyâ€ finished Kew Gardens; I mean it is all ready to print save a few lines. Light in my study gives out about 3.30. Now I shall try to do a few lines of Eliot before we go away. There is one of the usual kitchen intrigues to have Liz & children to Asheham for Christmas. Nelly doesnt like to ask me; Lottie makes up a rigmarole about saving us expense & this being the last time that she will be able to leave home. How terrible it is to be in this position to other grown people!
