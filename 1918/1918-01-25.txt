### Friday 25 January

My Birthday. L. slid a fine cowâ€™s horn knife into my hand this morning. Nelly has knitted me a pair of red socks which tie round the ankle, & thus just suit my state in the morning. Another event kept me recumbent. Barbara came, & together we â€œdissedâ€ 4 pages, & L. printed off the second 4 at the printersâ€”altogether a fine days work. At this rate Katherineâ€™s story will be done in 5 weeks. We rather think of doing a little book of woodcuts, either after this book or at the same time, on our small press. Our dinner tonight was a sacrifice to duty on a fine scale; never were we more ready for an evening alone; books to read; a sense of a great deal of talk already discharged this week; but rather before 7.30 came Clara (Woolf) & the Whithams, whom we had asked with a view to killing each other off without more waste than was inevitable. Whithamâ€™s elaborately literary get up is a fair index of his mind. He is what the self-taught working man thinks genius should be; & yet so unassuming & homely that its more amusing than repulsive. His passion for writing is the passion of the amateurâ€”or rather of the person whoâ€™s got it up from a text book. Seeing Cannanâ€™s new novel he said â€œAh, Cannan, yesâ€”heâ€™s very weak in construction isnâ€™t he?â€ And so with all the rest. He told me his books had a way of â€œscreamingâ€, & with great enthusiasm, after asking the fate of my fiction which is a point of honour in professional circles, he ran over all the novels heâ€™s got ready or half ready, or only in want of â€œphrasingâ€â€”which process he applies at the end. He begins with a synopsis, which takes him 3 months: but I didnâ€™t listen to the whole story. They withdraw soon to Devonshire, where directly the war ends (but even the war hasnâ€™t prevented him from adding a new book to the list) he is going to work hard. Writing all the morning, reading & walking the rest of the day. And so we may hope for some 20 Whithams during the next five years or so. When he had told us all this, he went on about spiritualism: their landlord being a fat pale solicitor of 50, who lies on a sofa all day down in Devonshire communing with spirits, & feeding upon bread & margarine. Whitham had dabbled in mysticism, & had made tables walz & heard phantom raps & believed it all, but was too much afraid of the results upon his character to go in for it seriously. I thought this showed weakness, and I expect he hasnâ€™t a good head on his shoulders, as his talk of novel writing makes one perceive. Sylvia sat marking time, & much pleased with the good impression she thought him to make; & in her precise way acknowledged the most revolutionary principles so that they seemed the gossip of a good housekeeper about the price of bacon. Claraâ€™s silence shows I think her subservient position in the family; a person who can never make herself feltâ€”unhappy & comfortless always, I expect. She stayed the night.

Today (Saturday) we went to Kew. Snowdrops, dwarf cyclamen, some miniature rhododendrons out; also the points of some squills or crocuses coming through the grass & dead leaves.
