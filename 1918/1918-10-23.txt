I went up to the concert, & heard the ghosts of lovely things, since the substance somehow escaped me; partly owing to my mood, partly to the usual vulgarity of Wood. Even so the ghosts of two Bach pieces (one for a duet of violins) were exquisitely lovely. Edith Sichel, whose entire soul is now open to me through her letters, makes me determine to write descriptions neither of pictures nor of music. She makes me consider that the gulf which we crossed between Kensington & Bloomsbury was the gulf between respectable mummâ ified humbug & life crude & impertinent perhaps, but living. The breath of South Kensington lives in her pagesâ€”almost entirely, I believe, because they would not mention either copulation or w.c.â€™s. However this brings me to our dinner with the MacCarthyâ€™s, when I borrowed this book. The book has a sort of fascination for me. I see the outside of that world so clearly, & take a kind of ribald pleasure in putting those figures into actionâ€”sending them slumming, to Pops concerts, to the National Gallery, always full of high thoughts, morality, kindliness, & never seeing beyond High St. Kensington. Molly, thanks to Bloomsbury, has escaped the Ritchie touch. Her book is anyhow giving her some exquisite pleasure, & pain too. Her head, so Desmond said, shrank to the size of an apple; it is now swelling to normal again. They were both in the best spiritsâ€”extraordinary if you consider that they were in their own house, & no wine allowed. They gave us an excellent meat dinner; D. has some hopes that if Turkey makes peace he will be discharged, & will then take to wandering & writing more articles.
