### Friday 7 June

One thing Adrian said amused meâ€”how it positively frightened him to see peoplesâ€™ faces on the Heath â€œlike gorillas, like orang-outangsâ€”perfectly inhumanâ€”frightfulâ€ & he poked his mouth out like an ape. He attributes this to the warâ€”though I can remember other pronouncements of the same kind before that. Perhaps the horrible sense of community which the war produces, as if we all sat in a third class railway carriage together, draws oneâ€™s attention to the animal human being more closely. L. was told the other day that the raids are carried out by women. Womenâ€™s bodies were found in the wrecked aeroplanes. They are smaller & lighter, & thus leave more room for bombs. Perhaps its sentimental, but the thought seems to me to add a particular touch of horror.

I went to the Magic Flute, & thought rather better of humanity for having that in them. Goldie was in the same row with me, thinking I daresay much the same thoughts, though the proximity of two youthful men may have coloured them differently. There were Roger & Pippa, & Sheppard & finally Mary Hutch. & Jack & Alix & Jamesâ€”all collecting in the hall for a moment in the twilight, for the sun, at 10 of a hot day, was hardly out of the sky. Mary & Jack in their dress clothes, took me back some 20 years; more accurately they took me back to the New English Art Club, she with her plastered hair, & he with his ruddy face & black riband across his shirt front. Home, & in the carriage I saw Jean Thomas, & remained hidden behind an officer. I dodged her successfully on getting out, & then, hurrying up the main road, distinctly heard myself called, â€œO thereâ€™s Virginia.â€ I hesitated, but judging such rudeness impossible, turned back, saw Jean! was received with the utmost surprise, for she had been talking about a cab, though thinking, so she said, of meâ€”She introduced me to Ann, who used to figure so when I was in bed; the lady with the romance in India, which Jean prayed she might have strength to overcome. I could only see a featureless shape, & strode on again, Jean begging to come & see us, very cordially.

I admit it may be vanity; but people do certainly show themselves very cordial & anxious to come all the way out hereâ€”I think we make a good mixtureâ€”at any rate, here are the Sangers, Kot & Gertler, Pippa all waiting to be fitted in, while Ottoline never ceases to gape wide for a week end. And weâ€™ve promised one to the Waterlows.
