### Thursday 4 July

We had a great bout of people yesterday, as we tend to do nowadays. Mary Hutch. Clive, & Borenius. They had been seeing pictures at Sir Cookâ€™s house, & came in later, elegant, frivolous, all garrulous except Mary who scarcely speaks, wanting tea. L. was printing; so I sat in the midst and we engaged in conversation. Borenius is I fancy a good-natured bore of the foreigner type. They tell long very explicit stories, launching out on them on the least provocation; but for one evening it did very well. They dined here; & again we assembled in the drawing room & talked till we could scarcely see each other. B.â€™s stories filled considerable space; how heâ€™d been made a Count & other stories encroaching upon Asquiths & Cunards. Clive jolly & jovial, cracking his whip & kicking up his heels; & we discussed pictures & jealousy, & derided a good many of our contemporaries. But, as usual, I enjoyed it; L. not quite so much. I took Mary Hutch, over the house; a very shy, or somehow unforthcoming woman; nice I expect, beneath such a fuss & exquisiteness of dress & get up that one has doubts whether she can be nice. She is going to write a story for us, if she can ever leave off scratching it out.

Today, L. printed off the last of Prelude, only the title page & dedication still to do. Today the printers machine is running, rather to our alarm, as he seems ignorant of it. We may have his press for Â£25. Very fine & hot.
