### Wednesday 10 July

We have sent off our first copies this evening, after spending the afternoon in glueing & covering. They surprised us when done by their professional lookâ€”the stiff blue cover pleases us particularly. I must read the book through after dinner, partly to find possible faults, but also to make up my mind how much I like it as literature.

Adrian & Karin dined here last night, & he spoke to the Guild on Peaceâ€”very composed, clear, well spoken, putting on his spectacles & reading in his pleasant intellectual voice from notes. He has traces of the judicial mind & manner. The women were more stirred than usual, though their reasoning isnâ€™t very very strong; & they are of course ignorant. But they would all have peace tomorrow, on any terms, & abuse our government for leading us on after a plan of its own. When asked to join a Peace Meeting in Hyde Park on Sunday, Mrs Langston, as spokeswoman, intimated that on no account could they violate the Sabbath. What a terrible grip Xtianity still hasâ€”she became rigid & bigoted at once, as if God himself had her in his grasp. That I believe is still the chief enemyâ€”the fear of God. But I was tactful enough to keep this view dark. Karin very voluble with her advanced views, though I never see how she comes by them. One canâ€™t trace any passion.

Rain for the first time for weeks today, & a funeral next door; dead of influenza.
