### Monday 18 March

I wrote the date, & then something interrupted meâ€”a letter I think, to Lytton giving reasons for not reviewing his book. Today is Wednesday, & this the first moment Iâ€™ve had for writing after tea. On Saturday the chatter began. Lytton & Carrington came to teaâ€”she apple red & firm in the cheeks, bright green & yellow in the body, & immensely firm & large all over. The talk has run off my mind, so that I donâ€™t suppose there was anything said of great importance. Theyâ€™d been at Barbaraâ€™s party till 5 the next morning. Fredegond & Nessa kept it off the rocks by giving an imitation of Ottoline. Nick & Saxon both gloomy in the background. Carrington going out of the room for a second, Lytton explained that he would like to stay with us without her, could it be managed. He asked me to review his book. I agreed without thinking. On second thoughts I dont much want to write under surveillance, or to ask Bâ (ruce). Râ (ichmond). for what he must know to be the book of a friend. On Sunday the burden of visitors was oppressive. The list speaks for itself. Gerald (Duckworth) & Saxon lunch: Saxon tea; Barbara, Nick, Middleton Murâ (r)â y dinner. Geraldâ€™s likeness to a pampered overfed pug dog has much increased. His hair is white. There is hardly a gleam of life, let alone intelligence in his eye. The feebleness of his hold on life save through the stomach must be fearful. He has no opinions, but merely a seaweeds drift in the prevailing current. His commercial view of every possible subject depressed me, especially when I thought of my novel destined to be pawed & snored over by him. But the odd thing was that he had nothing to say. This took till 3, perhaps; Saxon at his least urbane & most insignificant. Its melancholy that misfortune should be unbecoming, but Iâ€™m afraid in his case it is. His complexion suffers; his mind seems frost bitten. He was beaten at chess, & went, as if not wishing to meet N. & B. Nick was the only cheerful one of us. Poor Murry snarled & scowled with the misery of his lot. He works all day, & writes when he comes home. Worst of all, K.M. has been very ill with haemorrhage from the lungs, out in France, & has to be brought home, wh. is difficult, in order to see how bad she is. But I thought him very much more of a person & a brain than I had thought him before. I think this was partly due to the contrast with Nick. The difference between a good mind & a mediocre one is very sharpâ€”Not that M. is as easy, or as agreeable. But he works his brains, always has worked them, & thus cuts his way through a different atmosphere. I had a good deal of talk about books with him, such as one couldnâ€™t have with Nickâ€”though heâ€™s read Jane Austen, & can keep his end up by natural good sense & taste. B. was almost blotted out; scarcely spoke, I think. They went first; we said goodbye, the modern method of covering all obviously emotional crises with a varnish of prose & common sense makes such partings almost ostentatiously matter of fact. Murry stayed on, for a time, discussing French writers & Thomas Hardy. He will never write another novel, he says. Poetry is a short cut & â€œlife seems to me now very precarious.â€

On Monday (18 March) I stayed here & did my compositors work. L. to London.

On Tuesday we had tea at the Club, meeting all the usual people, save that Brynâ€™s a rarity, went to a general meeting, where L. was elected 5th on the committee; & then on to dine with Ka. Arnold Forster the other guest. Much to my surprise the first person to come in afterwards was Hilton Young. I dont think Iâ€™ve said 6 words to him since 1908â€”when we had that interview. Iâ€™ve always guessed that dark dealings on the part of O.H. intervened; at anyrate we broke completely. This knowledge made me at least uncomfortable. But we are elderly now. He a perfect type of naval officer, cleanshaven, shorn, red faced, all blue cloth & gold braid with a ribbon on his breast. His dark enigmatic ways (the Sphinx without a Secret) are swept away; & yet I liked himâ€”thought him kind & trusty & a little romanticâ€”Iâ€™m afraid no longer romantic about me. But how even begin to guess anotherâ€™s feelings? I found myself pitying him for the very first time. I suppose heâ€™s more than 40, & after all, he wished for something which heâ€™s done without. We talked hard indeed. He findâ (s) no romance in the navy after four years. We wondered about our vision of England. Not knowing his degree of pugnacity, talk was difficult save on general subjects. The Shoves came, & a brisk friend of Kaâ€™s out of an office I think, as we left. Little W.A.F. very humble, very small, very innocent, as he used to be.
