### Friday 16 August

My visit to Charleston & L.â€™s to York are both partly responsible for this skip. But Iâ€™ve skipped too much to give a very full account of one or of the other. Bonwickâ€™s villa precisely expresses Bonwick: & a stuffy smell thrown in; windows curtained in thick white; pictures of Niagara. They spent 17 hours in travelling to York & back; & the result, still to await another meeting of Trustees, though Bonwick is sure they mean to agree. The Labour people are to be dropped. My visit to Charleston was spent mostly in sitting in the drawingâ (room) & talking to N. while she made herself a small brown coat. Duncan wandered in & out; sometimes digging a vegetable bed, sometimes painting a watercolour of bedroom china, pinned to a door. In the evening there was the lumpish Bunny, inclined to be surly; & N. inclined to take him up sharply. What did we discuss? There was Kaâ€™s engagement, concerning which Duncan had a good deal to say; one of his statements being that A.-F. is 45, & always has been. Another is that he lent to certain affections & practised them in an Italian villa. I made out a description of Garsington. The hunger of poor Ottoline for some recognition in Sussex is proved by her offering herself for any day in the summer after July 8th. She was abruptly told that none suitedâ€”which explains her eagerness to insert her foot here. Then we discussed the Aâ drian, Stephenâ€™s: he a dead weight, & she a live one, according to N. who warns me we shall repent of asking them hereâ€”this in front of Duncan too, who said nothing to contradict. So our relationships change, imperceptibly enough. When N. & I were alone, I supposed we discussed the two parrokeets & money, which is not any longer such a distant, speculative sort of commodity as it used to beâ€”at least to her. We discussed the children too; the sort of talk that runs on when one knows all the facts, but wishes to ascertain how theyâ€™ve changed positionâ€”What for instance is Lyttonâ€™s view of Mrs Asquith; & hers of him; & Maynardâ€™s of them both. Gertlerâ€™s notions of painting: his views of their painting; Duncanâ€™s fame: Bunnyâ€™s socialism. Bunny thus defines his position: all capitalists are wrong; therefore for him to live upon Vanessa is good, inasmuch as she enjoys money that she has no right to, & could not possibly spend her interest better than by maintaining him. This evolved from a sentimental declaration by him that he ought to spend his life in giving honey to his friends for nothing. His brain must be a tangle of sentiments & half-realised socialism. I bicycled back on Wednesday & found L. & we were very happy, until it came to the fat baconâ€”when, alasâ€”!
