### Monday 28 October

L. found Lytton with a swollen finger & 2 or 3 spots on his hand sitting over the fire, & only moving when enveloped in a silk tablecloth, & wrapping his hand also in silk handkerchiefs & complaining of the cold, & describing nights of agony when a pain like toothache seizes upon him & develops into frantic agonies only to be allayed by morphia. This has been going on for a month, & Carrington is at her wits end, very naturally. Anything like pain is abhorrent to all Stracheys, but making all allowances for the exaggerations & terrors of the poor creature, he has had a sufficient dose of horror, I imagine, & the doctor privately warns Carrington that shingles may last months. However, Lytton is probably moving in to Mary in a day or two, avoiding London, because of the influenzaâ€”(we are, by the way, in the midst of a plague unmatched since the Black Death, according to the Times, who seem to tremble lest it may seize upon Lord Northcliffe, & thus precipitate us into peace). But I am far from peace. A fortnight ago all Bloomsbury rang with my crimes; M.H. was conveyed about London in a fainting condition in taxicabs; Lytton was appealed to come to her rescue; Duncan Clive Vanessaâ€”all were in agonies & desperations. Why no one charged me with it then, I donâ€™t know; my private theory is that Clive inspired V.â€™s letter as a precaution against further indiscretions, giving strict orders that his name should not be mentioned. I soothed myself by denouncing the spy system, & now am quite unable even to feel irritated. It all comes, so I think, from the indiscreet way in which people like M.H. accept positions which they are unable to fill, & thus flinching & shying constantly, keep everybody in a state of discomfort. I announce my intention to keep clear of that set in future; & as I write this, the post brings a letter from Eliot asking to come & see us.

To my great surprise a voice upon the telephone developed into the voice of Lady Mary Murray; asking us to lunch yesterday. We changed lunch to tea & went off to Moreâ€™s Gardens, a block of flats on the Embankment, where after ringing for some time, a gigantic knock was answered by Lady Mary in person. L. was half inclined to think her an untidy but cordial housemaid. The Fisher Williamsâ€™ were there. A tea party is the least natural of situations, & produces the utmost amount of discomfort I think. Then the F.W.â€™s possessed only the brain of one moderate sized rabbit between them. Still it was the respectability that weighed me down, not the absence of intellect. There are certain dun coloured misty days in autumn which remind me of the Murrayâ€™s atmosphere. The cleanliness of Gilbert was remarkable; a great nurse must rub him smooth with pumice stone every morning; he is so discreet, so sensitive, so low in tone & immaculate in taste that you hardly understand how he has the boldness to beget children. She is a wispy elderly lady, highly nervous, a little off hand & much of an aristocrat in her dashing method, kindly, fussy, refined tooâ€”O yes, they are all refined. I sat & talked to Gilbert first about our love of sweets, then about the Greek love of wine, then about his standing with the Government. He has, he says, refused many honours, but was reprimanded for sending a review of a book on Job to America. Maliciously enough, I felt that his simplicity was maintained in the face of years of worship & adulation, & that the proper thing to say is â€œHow wonderfully simple dear Gilbert Murray is!â€ But his niceness was unmeasured. The Toynbees came in. I had a long rigmarole with Arnold about his office & his learning & so forth; I think I frighten him; or perhaps Iâ€™m not used to the Oxford manner. Its suavity & politeness are strange to me. He is so shortsighted that he has a painful look of pinkness round the eyes, as if he were a grammar school boy exalted by the most assiduous industry to positions above his station. Iâ€™m always surprised to find how well meaning & even outspoken he is in spite of this.

Home to find Freda Major marooned at the station, so that L. had to fetch her. Herbert came after a field day; heâ€™d been out since 6. & took F. home, & caught the last train to Staines. Freda is merely a toy dog enveloped in human flesh, but retaining the pretty, plaintive, rather peevish ways of her canine existence. She has stimulated Herbert to talk with greater fluency & enthusiasm than usual about the policeman strike & Fordâ€™s motor cars.
