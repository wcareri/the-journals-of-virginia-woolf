### Monday 14 January

We had Saxon to dinner on Saturday. He was at his lowest ebb. It was impossible to talk to him, but I guessed that he grieves over the inevitable frailty of mankind: his dream of love & friendship triumphing over jealousy has, I expect, been shattered by the latest developments: & he finds himself in a position odious to so scrupulous & sensitive a man as he is. Still, the effects arenâ€™t enlivening for his friends. Even his gestures are weariful. He has been nowhere seen no one. I remember this fragment:

â€œHave you seen anyone Saxon?â€  
â€œIâ€™ve finished the third volume of the Anthology.â€

He brought me two books of selections from Italian literature. He wrote my name in them with extreme dexterity & neatness. Played chess with Leonard, was beaten which didnâ€™t add to his spirits, & left burdened with the mysteries of this unintelligible world.

On Sunday, Clive came to tea; he hadnâ€™t long settled in when the Shoves arrived; & we spent an hour or two in gossip. When one sees Clive fairly often, his devices for keeping up to the mark in the way of success & brilliance become rather obvious. We were all talking of the 17 Club: upon which he rapped out â€œI was among the haughty people who wouldnâ€™t join when they were asked, now of course I find its the thing to do, & Iâ€™ve had to climb downâ€ the truth being that he wished to join & was blackballed by L. & others. Such would be the truth of many of his stories I daresay, if one knew. But one doesnâ€™t know; the results are quite agreeable, however produced. And as I persuaded him to lend me his typewriter for Asheham, Iâ€™ve no reason to be censorious. His habits are like those of some faded beauty; a touch of rouge, a lock of yellow hair, lips crimsoned. We talked chiefly about the hypnotism exerted by Bloomsbury over the younger generation. Some merriment over Cliveâ€™s picture of â€œthe complete schoolmasterâ€ at Tidmarsh. F. and G. had gone there, & after tea master & pupil withdrew, but in she (Carrington) came to fetch a volume of Lord Macaulay; & later she asked to be enlightened about some anecdote of Rousseau. â€œThat youâ€™ll know when youâ€™re older, my dearâ€ said Lytton paternally. She took F. aside & confided to her some difficulty about Barbara & Nick. â€œNick, she said, is reading hardâ€, as though there might be hope for him in that. Theyâ€™re all â€œreading hardâ€. Saxon asked Maynard the other day whether he thought Petronius suitable reading for a young lady, who liked Apuleius. But the young ladies dont like Apuleiusâ€”when theyâ€™re alone. Its matter for a comedy. Indeed I see the plots of many comedies brewing just now among our friends. Thereâ€™s the comedy of Alix & Bunny; of James & Anonyma; & the tragi-comedy of the two cockatoos. After Clive went, F. & G. stayed to dinner, & were more at their ease. F. told us of A.â€™s wedding night; undertaken by her from a dutiful wish to gain experience, though the experience included so much autobiography on B.â€™s part, & Iâ€™ve no doubt, eulogies of his father, & peans of the lesser literary lights of the day, that I think she bought it dear. But â€œon the whole Iâ€™m feeling better: partly owing to Bunnyâ€. F. has a great turn for mimicry. She mimicked Karin breaking in late at night & asking â€œHave you a bite for Carry?â€ & proceeding to ransack their larder. Karin slapping her thigh & exclaiming â€œWeâ€™ll have a jaunt; weâ€™ll crack a jokeâ€; & also Karin bursting into tears one night from a sense that Maynard &c didnâ€™t want to see her. In fact the dominion that â€œBloomsburyâ€ exercises over the sane & the insane alike seems to be sufficient to turn the brains of the most robust. Happily, Iâ€™m â€œBloomsburyâ€ myself, & thus immune; but Iâ€™m not altogether ignorant of what they mean. & its a hypnotism very difficult to shake off, because thereâ€™s some foundation for it. Oddly, though, Maynard seems to be the chief fount of the magic spirit. Talk about capital with Gerald: he says he means to part with his, but I guess that he always has some scruple to play with as an intellectual exercise.
