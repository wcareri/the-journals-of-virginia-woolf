### Tuesday 28 May

The rush of books was disposed of, & Squire was well drubbed too; at the same time such a rush of people coincided, that I was clogged into complete dumbness, I see; but to take up the pen directly upon coming back from Asheham shows I hope that this book is now a natural growth of mineâ€”a rather dishevelled, rambling plant, running a yard of green stalk for every flower. The metaphor comes from Asheham. But first let me recall Janet, Desmond, Katherine Mansfield & Lilian; there were others,â€”yes, there was Harry Stephen & Clive. Each left with me a page full of comments, but useless now partly I think from my habit of telling these incidents over to people, & once told, I donâ€™t want to retell them, the telling leaves a groove in my mind which gives a hardness to the memory, stereotypes it, makes it a little dull. But I wandered through Richmond Park in the moonlight with Desmond. We jumped a palisade into Miss Hickmanâ€™s funeral grove, & found the dark green mounds pointed with red rosettes. The rhododendron is a lovely flower for the moonlight. And we beheld a china watercloset also lovely in the moonlight, the divinity of a sheltered lodger, wedged in among the ferns & the flowering bushes. Desmond, who has been pestering me with inscrutable persistence, over the telephone in letters in visits to lunch with Prince Bibesco, dropped all that, drank a whole bottle, & bubbled like a tipsy nightingale, amorous, humorous, reminiscent, &, remembering the dead, perhaps melancholy in a happy sort of way. But he spoke rather pointedly of the charm & intelligence of Molly.

â€œYes, Iâ€™ve never feared tragedy in your livesâ€ I said, nor does one, though from what we hear, they strain at the collar now & then. But modern life has the merit of allowing for that. Katherine was marmoreal, as usual, just married to Murry, & liking to pretend it a matter of convenience. She looks ghastly ill. As usual we came to an oddly complete understanding. My theory is that I get down to what is true rock in her, through the numerous vapours & pores which sicken or bewilder most of our friends. Itâ€™s her love of writing I think. But she is off to Cornwall. Harry Stephen told his old stories, wrinkled his nose, & alluded several times to his great age. He is 58. An undoubted failure; but that has a freshening effect upon people; they are more irresponsible than the successes; but yet one canâ€™t call Harry exactly irresponsible either. He is modest; humorous; all his pride for his father & ancestors. He still takes out an enormous pocket knife, & slowly half opens the blade, & shuts it. Janet was decidely more spirited than of late. She discussed Greek with L. She is still puzzling out theories about Plato: very open minded, & ready to understand whatever one may spring on her. I sprang first, Joyceâ€™s novel, then the Murrys; who are to be neighbours. Lilian read a paper to the Guild in a thoroughly co-operative spirit; I think I should take exception to their maternal care of the womenâ€™s souls, if I were connected with the movement. But I see the terrible temptation of thinking oneself in the right, & wishing to guide & influence.

Then Clive was in his best man-of-the-world vein, fresh from Max Beerbohm, & inclined to think himself one of our foremost. He sent me his book, where I find myself with Hardy & Conrad; & Nessa & Duncan bracketed first. He babbled & prattled & hinted at all his friends & parties & interestsâ€”not offensively, to me at least. He gives, or wishes to give the impression that he sits drinking in the CafÃ© Royal with Mary, & the young poets & painters drift up, & he knows them all, & between them they settle the business. His book is stout morality & not very good criticism. He seems to have little natural insight into literature. Roger declares that he doesnâ€™t know about pictures. On the other hand, he has the strong English sense of morality. At Asheham we had Roger, a picnic, & I spent a night at Charleston. That is by way of company. But the important thing was the weather. The heat was such that it was intolerable to walk before tea; we sat in the garden, I indolently reading, L. not sitting but gardening. We had the best display of flowers yet seenâ€”wall flowers in profusion, columbines, phlox, & as we went huge scarlet poppies with purple stains in them. The peonies even about to burst. There was a nest of blackbirds against the wall. Last night at Charleston I lay with my window open listening to a nightingale, which beginning in the distance came very near the garden. Fishes splashed in the pond. May in England is all they sayâ€”so teeming, amorous, & creative. I talked a good deal with Nessaâ€”much about servants & other possibilities. Roger, of course, came up from Bo-Peep, & there was Mrs Bâ rereton, burnt brown, solid, stolid, institutional, & very competent. Roger & I croaked a kind of frogs chorus togetherâ€”how we loved & admired & were only snubbed for our painsâ€”Nessa sitting almost silent, stitching a dress by lamplight. Roger is growing more egoistical, or it is more apparent to me; & his complaints were more genuine than mine. All interesting people are egoists, perhaps; but it is not in itself desirable. There were numbers of Belgian Hares, & equal numbers of children to judge by the sound, though they are kept to their own rooms & hours by Mrs B. & donâ€™t appear at all. Saxon & Barbara arrive at Asheham as we goâ€”this being our compromise, for we didnâ€™t want them as visitors as they, coolly enough, proposed that we should have them.
