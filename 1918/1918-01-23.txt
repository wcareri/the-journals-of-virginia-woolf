### Wednesday 23 January

I see Iâ€™ve forgotten yesterday; but it was uneventful. L. went up to a meeting, Barbara was left in control of the Press, & I took a walk by myself. I went along the river to Marble Hill. I must retract what I said about the Hell of the year. We have glimpses of Heaven. So mild that the landing window is open, & I sat by the river watching a boat launched, & half expected to see buds on the willows. River very high, swift & yellow, testifying to the floods higher up. They say its been raining heavily; I daresay it has, but such is the civilisation of life in London that I really dont know. What with fires, electric light, underground railways & umbrellas, how can one take notice of the weather. But we look out about bed time & notice the moon. Very clear cut & polished & almost full till 9 or so, & then, much as if God did turn over in his sleep & press a button, down comes a curtain of cloud, & we yawn & sleep sound. Last night, after giving B. her tea, which wastes the chief delight of the day, though poor woman she canâ€™t be better behaved, & if she were gifted no doubt one would hate her actively, we dined early & had the Guild. Mr Adams (unidentified) spoke. The level is certainly not a high one. Even when they know their subject, as he did, they dont know it in such a way as to to make it plain to the uneducated. I doubt whether more than 3 people in the room knew that he was talking of the Co-ops. & politics. He began in the middle. He read bald phrases from Congress resolutions. He could just pronounce such a word as â€œautonomousâ€, but I donâ€™t suppose anyone understood it. As usual, L. & I were the only people to speak, save Mrs Langston; as usual it was only when talk drifted near food that one of the women broke silence. She wanted a bread shop. They all got bread late in the day: for a time they all spoke at onceâ€”stories of their own ill treatment & of their neighbours. Oddly phlegmatic these women for the most part; with a passive sort of pleasure in sitting there & watching like so many pale grey sea anemones stuck to their rocks. Still, the children, the houseworkâ€”excuses enough if one troubled to look.

Talking of sea anemones reminds me that weâ€™re in treaty with D. H. Lawrence for his house at Zennor. Its very distant & improbable at present though sufficiently tempting to make me think of that sea & those cliffs several times a day.

Today, Wednesday, B. didnâ€™t come, & we printed. L. did the most of it; & I made two little excursions into Richmond, one to discover the right way of spelling Mynah; the other to buy a new battery, price 1/3. Two of mine have perished during the lifetime of Lâ€™s. methusaleh: the wicked old wretch still burns like a spark from a star. I think its wise to have mine in readiness for the raid, though three tradespeople of Richmond know for a certain that there will never be another. The bakers windows now provide almost nothing but little plates of dull biscuits; sections of plain cake; & little buns without any plums. If you see a plum, it is invariably a decoy plum; there are no others. This transformation scene has been stealing on imperceptibly; last year were we still allowed iced cakes? Its unthinkable!
