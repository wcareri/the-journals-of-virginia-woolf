### Monday 17 June

Another gap of ten days takes me to the conclusion of our Waterlow visit. With the sort of clumsiness one might expect of them, theyâ€™ve pitched upon a house in the village of Oare; taken it for 28 years; in spite of the way it misses all the good qualities one might have had, with such a range to choose from. You have a view of a dull farmyard; only a glimpse of down, & the house stands in the village street, too much in a hollow to be capable of a view. Sydney has mellowed & grown less susceptible to the good & bad opinions of his friends. She is a gnome like figure; but acute as the unattractive women tend to be, depending upon hard work for their wages. She produced excellent food, & manages the two unattractive children without a nurse. â€œAll is black round meâ€ she said, during a discussion on Saturday night, â€œI get no acute sensations; I wonder if its worth while.â€ S. talks of taking to literature again. The defect of the household lies in their relationship. She has no admiration for him; he no romance about her. Clear eyed people could scarcely feel otherwise; but how I hate the average! Strictly speaking, theyâ€™re both above the average. The average is a very queer study though: humble, aspiring, & without illusions.

None of these qualities are common with the people we see for the most part. I must run over the names of those weâ€™ve seen in 10 days, so far as I can remember them. Ray for the night; Molly for dinner & also for the night; the Sangers & Murry;â€”the others are now forgotten. Ray lectured the W.C.G. How strange it is to see oneâ€™s friends taking their fixed shape! How one can foretell middle age for them, & almost see them with the eyes of the younger generation! â€œRather a terrorâ€, I think theyâ€™ll say of Ray. She has the look of conscious morality which is born of perpetual testifying to the right. She has grown heavier, more dogmatic; her attitudes are those of the public speaker & woman used to knocking about the country. She speaks in all the counties of England. She has lost such feminine charm as she had; she seems mature. But she is made of solid stuff; & this comes through & pleases me, & L. likes her better than the cropheads. We discussed the moral eminence of Moore, comparable to that of Christ or Socrates, so R. & L. held. They challenged me to match him in that respect by any of my friends. I claimed for Nessa Duncan Lytton & Desmond something different but of equal value. R. tends to think us a set of gifted but good for nothing wastrels. Her days work gives her some claim to look down upon us; but it would be unfair to say that she condescends or judges. She merely makes one aware of a different ideal. What ideal does Molly live for? A very wandering will oâ€™ the wispâ€”but she chases it, & sticks in the bog, poor woman, & hasnâ€™t the clearest of notions as to what sheâ€™s after. She has Desmondâ€™s Character on her mind. She imagines that he is much talked about, & greatly derided. Its worth noting for my own benefit how very little talk goes on compared with the victims notion of what must go on. She had ready an elaborate defence of D. but finding it unneeded, she confessed to the truthâ€”that she finds him a little spoilt, terribly without a will, & much at the mercy of any fine lady or gentleman with good wine. I couldnâ€™t deny all this. I believe she worries herself acutely. Let alone the worry of money; she has a sense of failure, of decadence, & infulfilment. She means to give up London & live in the country, as an attempt at cure. But thereâ€™s something sordid about it nowâ€”no longer pure fun. She finds his mind vitiated; his views no longer so interesting.

Murry & the Sangers came here to supper last Sunday. Dora becomes increasingly ungainly. She has become so lame that in order to take off her boots, she has to kick out one leg, & then hunch herself round into an attitude where she can crook hold of it again. Indeed, I had to do it for her. Murry was pale as death, with gleaming eyes, & a crouching way at table that seemed to proclaim extreme hunger or despair. Charlie has his wintry brightness still; but weighed down by all this cadaverous company, he scarcely chirped his best. And after dinner such a duet of despair was croaked by Murry & Dora as warmed the cockles of Doraâ€™s heart.

â€œAt Christmas, said Murry, I was near suicide; but I worried out a formula which serves to keep me going. Its the conception of indifferentism. I have hope no longer. I live in 2 layers of conscience. (but I forget what these were.) Dora egged him on, & sounded his praises when we went through the struggle with the boots again.

But to us he seemed less nice, perhaps more anxious for effect, this time than before. Despairing young men who have worked out philosophies & describe them remind me too much of Henry Lamb. But thereâ€™s more than that in Murry. I expect he is used to being an oracle in the underworld.

Then Leonard went to the annual dinner, which was almost a dinner in honour of Lytton; but not very interesting to L. at least; & I went to Don Giovanni, to my infinite delight; & last Friday we went to the League of Nations meeting. The jingoes were defeated by the cranks. It was a splendid sight to see. The chief jingo was H. G. Wells, a slab of a man formidable for his mass, but otherwise the pattern of a professional cricketer. He has the cockney accent in words like â€œdayâ€. He was opposed by Oliver (Strachey), Mrs Swanwick & Adrian. There were also present such gnomes as always creep out on such occasionsâ€”old women in coats & skirts with voluminous red ties, & little buttons & badges attached to themâ€”crippled, stammering men, & old patriarchs with beards, & labour men, & ourselves. Lord Shaw presided, & Sir W. Dickinson. It was comical to see their polite horror at the sight of our party, but Hobson won, by virtue, I expect, of his academic appearance. Wells, when he found himself thwarted lost the sort of effervescent good temper he has, & struck out as wildly as he could, & spat sarcasms at Williams & Hobson; & finally left the room; but we found him caballing in the hall with McCurdie & Spender, & L. is now in London hearing the result at a meeting of the executive.
