### Tuesday 12 March

This page should be wholly devoted to praise of the weather. One curious effect of spring in the suburbs is that it produces an astonishing amount of male & female singing in the evening. We sit with open windows, & a lady warbles out notes in apparent ecstasy. She may be forgiven though, consideringâ€”Here are some facts. I sat by choice on a seat in the shade at Kew; I saw two Heath butterflies; willows, crocuses, squills all in bud & blossom. Black clothes look like dusty palls. As for fur, it makes one laugh. We met at Kew.

I may say that Iâ€™m â€œrejected by the Timesâ€. To rub this sore point sorer, L. has 2 books from the Nation. Its the second week of my rejection; & it has the result of making me write my novel at an astonishing rate. If I continue dismissed, I shall finish within a month or two. It becomes very absorbing. We both notice that lately weâ€™ve written at a terrific pace: L. 40,000 words & as yet hasnâ€™t touched the book itself; Iâ€™m well past 100,000â€”
