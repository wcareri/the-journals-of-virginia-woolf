### Wednesday 1 May

Thereâ€™s a fate in saying that weâ€™re safe from raids; On Friday I went to the Hippodrome, to see life; L. seeing a different variety of it at the 17 Club. The incredible, pathetic stupidity of the music hall, (for surely we could have risen higher, & only politeness made us laugh,) almost made me uncomfortable; but the humour of Harry Tate, though a low grade was still the queer English humour; something natural to the race, which makes us all laugh; why I donâ€™t know; & you canâ€™t help feeling its the real thing, as, in Athens one might have felt that poetry was. Home about 11. At 12 the usual maroons, & even extra whistling. The fine night made this likely; we bundled our bedding into the kitchen & took up our appointed stations; L. and I lying by the grate; N. & Lottie whispering in the cellar. After 20 minutes, I thought I heard bugles. Oneâ€™s ears can imagine so much that I said nothing. Ten minutes later Nelly burst out â€œThe bugles!â€ So they were. We went upstairs, inclined to blame some clerk whose ears played him tricks which the night made into certainties. But Desmond tells us that 3 American aeroplanes crossing the coast without giving the signal caused the false alarm, which woke the whole of London, though ignored by the press.

On Saturday we went to Hampton Court, the first visit for a long time. But this weather (I am unjust though; Saturday was fine). We had a tremendous talk about the Equator. In the middle of a demonstration with two pebbles, Jack Radcliffe passed (or so I thought). This diverted my attention. A serious reprimand had to be administered. It was discovered that I took the Equator to be a circular mark, coloured dull red, upon the end of a football. The ignorance & inattention combined displayed in this remark seemed so crass that for about 20 minutes we couldnâ€™t speak. However, I was forgiven, & told about the tropics of Cancer & Capricorn. The question originally was about the time of moon & sun rise & setting in different months.

On Sunday, Desmond came to dinner; that is after dinner. He has the hard sea worthy look of an old salt, cased in stiff black, with a few gold scrolls about him, & hoots made out of plain leather. But within this shell he is as tender & vague as ever, & very tired after his days work which results, he is alarmed to find & so are we, in practical action upon his evidence. His mind had a factitious spryness about it, as if still working under the official eye; but this wore off, & he yawned, & couldnâ€™t stir himself up, though L.â€™s yawns were partly the cause of his. Late at night he took to reading Joyceâ€™s ms. aloud, & in particular to imitating his modern imitation of a catâ€™s miau, but L. went to bed, & though capable of spending a night in this manner, I had compunction, & decoyed Desmond upstairs, collecting books as we went. Next morning, having observed that breakfast at 8.30 would possibly be early enough, he stayed talking about books till 10, & rambled off quite out of tune for his office. L. dined with the Webbs. At this point it would be useful could I command the pen of some intelligent & well informed diarist, with an eye for the future; someone who could put down what were the really interesting things that Sir Wm Tyrrell, Camile Huysman, & the Sidney Webbs said.

Went to dine at Webbs. Camille Huysmans & Sir William Tyrrell there. The latter is now Head of Commercial Intelligence Dept & is engaged on drawing up complete dossier of our terms for the Peace Conference. A small, round, grey, friendly man, more like a well-mannered literary manâ€”if there be suchâ€”than a diplomatist. Very frankâ€”ostensiblyâ€”& talked incessantly of policies & people. â€œA friend of mine was at Kiel on the day of the murder of the Arch Duke & saw the Kaiser immediately after he had heard the news. The K. said: â€œEs ist ein Verbrechen gegen das Germantumâ€. When I heard that, I knew it meant war.â€ â€œLichnowsky has a poor mind. He is a sort of village idiot. His Polish blood however gives him a kind of intuition so that he sees further sometimes than cleverer menâ€”the intuition of the village idiot.â€ The only hope, he said, was for the Allies definitely to declare themselves for a League of Nations & define its constitution. We should be surprised, if the German offensive fails, at the stiffness of the German terms even then. â€œWilson under certain circumstances will be the most immoveable of Never-endians.â€ â€œThe most impertinent thing ever written was Kuhlmannâ€™s answer to the Pope. A friend of mine met K. & K. told him when he came to England to ask me what I thought of it. I said: â€˜Tell K. I think exactly what he thinks of it!â€ He said he had always thought that the greatest mistake the Allies ever made was to refuse to allow our men to go to the Stockholm Conference.

On Tuesday I went to London. In fact, I went to the printers in Farringdon Street, & got wind of a second hand press; but how far this is the usual talk of shopkeepers I donâ€™t know.

On Wednesday May 1st we were to have printed off; our 8 pages were ready, & a 9th too (w. gave out this time). But the printer has his magazine on the press & wont be free till Saturday. These impediments are inevitable but jarringâ€”We were getting along so well.

On Thursday, we tried printing the title page on the small press. Nothing would make it come right. The disease escaped us. We had to give up in despairâ€”irritation at least. All these days as black as November; & a high cold East wind.
