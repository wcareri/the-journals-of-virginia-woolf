### Monday 4 July

Back from Long Barn. Thank heaven, I never had to change my dress. Such opulence & freedom, flowers all out, butler, silver, dogs, biscuits, wine, hot water, log fires, Italian cabinets, Persian rugs, booksâ€”this was the impression it made: as of stepping into a rolling gay sea, with nicely crested waves: as if the anxious worn life had suddenly been set on springs, & went bounding, springing for the week end. Yet I like this room better perhaps: more effort & life in it, to my mind, unless this is the prejudice one has naturally in favour of the display of oneâ€™s own character. Vita very opulent, in her brown velvet coat with the baggy pockets, pearl necklace, & slightly furred cheeks. (They are like saviours flannel, of which she picked me a great bunch, in texture) Of its kind this is the best, most representative human life I know: I mean, certain gifts & qualities & good fortunes are here miraculously combinedâ€”I liked Harold too. He is a spontaneous childlike man, of no great boring power; has a mind that bounces when he drops it; he opens his eyes as he looks at one; has a little immature moustache; curled hair; an air of immaturity which is welcome. I should judge him very generous & kind hearted; an Englishman overlaid with culture; coming of a sunburnt country stock; & not much fined even by diplomacy. After dinner last night we discussed the Empire. â€œI prefer Sydney to Paris. Australia is more important than France. After all, its our younger sons out there. I feel proud of it. The point is, Raymond, our English genius is for government.â€ â€œThe governed donâ€™t seem to enjoy itâ€ said Raymond. Silly ass, said Harold. â€œWe do our job: disinterestedly; we dont think of ourselves, as the French do, as the Germans do. Take the British oil fields. Thereâ€™s a hospital there where they take any one, employee or not. The natives come from all over the place. Donâ€™t tell me thats not a good thing. And they trust us.â€ So on to the system of bribery; to the great age of England being the age of colonial expansion. â€œI grant Shakespeareâ€™s a nasty snag.â€ â€œBut why not grow, change?â€ I said. Also, I said, recalling the aeroplanes that had flown over us, while the portable wireless played dance music on the terrace, â€œcanâ€™t you see that nationality is over? All divisions are now rubbed out, or about to be.â€ Raymond vehemently assented. Raymond is all for the triumph of mind. What action matters? Actions matter most of all, said Harold. I was sitting on a carved Italian stool over the log fire; he & Raymond bedded in the soft green sofa. Leonardâ€™s injustice to the aristocracy was discussed. Before this, Lord Sackville & Mrs Rubens had come over, partly to protect their respectability, partly to play tennis. (They wonâ€™t stay at Knole alone if possible; & if they must, sanctify the proceeding by calling on Vita). He is a smooth worn man, inheriting noble nose & chin which he has not put much into himself; a straight, young looking man, save that his face has the lack lustre of a weak man whose life has proved too much for him. No longer does he struggle much for happiness, I imagine; accepts resignedly; & goes to Maidstone almost daily, as part of the routine of his nobility. He plays golf; he plays tennis. He thinks Bernard Darwin must be a man of surpassing brain power. We sat together under a vast goat skin coat of Vitaâ€™s, watching them play? & I found him smooth & ambling as a blood horse, but obliterated, obfusc, with his great Sackville eyes drooping, & his face all clouded with red & brown. One figured a screw or other tool whose worms & edges have been rubbed smooth, so that though they shine, plaid silver, they no longer grip.

Vita very free & easy, always giving me great pleasure to watch, & recalling some image of a ship breasting a sea, nobly, magnificently, with all sails spread, & the gold sunlight on them. As for her poetry, or intelligence, save when canalised in the traditional channels, I can say nothing very certain. She never breaks fresh ground. She picks up what the tide rolls to her feet. For example, she follows, with simple instinct, all the inherited tradition of furnishing, so that her house is gracious, glowing, stately, but without novelty or adventure. So with her poetry, I daresay. Raymond & I travelled up & discussed them. She the most noble character he said; both almost defiantly fortunate, so that Harold touches wood when he reflects on his own life, heaves a sigh & says how, if it were dashed down tomorrow, he would have had his day. But it wont be dashed down at all. It will grow freely & fully round them both; their fruit will ripen, & their leaves golden; & the night will be indigo blue, with a soft gold moon. They lack only what we haveâ€”some cutting edge; some invaluable idiosyncracy, intensity, for which I would not have all the sons & all the moons in the world.
