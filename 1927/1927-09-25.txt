On the opposite page I wrote notes for Shelley, I think by mistake for my writing book.

Now let me become the annalist of Rodmell.

Thirty five years ago, there were 160 families living here where there are now no more than 80. It is a decaying village, which loses its boys to the towns. Not a boy of them, said the Rev. Mr Hawkesford, is being taught to plough. Rich people wanting week end cottages buy up the old peasants houses, for fabulous sums. Monks House was offered to Mr H. for Â£400: we gave Â£700. He refused it, saying he didnâ€™t wish to own country cottages. Now Mr Allinson will pay Â£1200 for a couple, & we he said might get Â£2,000 for this.

He is an old decaying man, run to seed. His cynicism, & the pleasant turn it gives his simple worn out sayings, amuses me. He is sinking into old age, very shabby, loose limbed, wearing black wool mittens. His life is receding like a tide, slowly; or one figures him as a dying candle, whose wick will soon sink into the warm grease & be extinct. To look at, he is like some aged bird; a little, small featured face, with heavily lidded smoky bright eyes; his complexion is still ruddy; but his beard is like an unweeded garden. Little hairs grow weakly all over his cheeks, & two strands are drawn, like pencil marks, across his bald head. He tumbles into an armchair; & tells over his stock of old village stories, which always have this slightly mocking flavour, as though, completely unambitious, & by no means successful himself, he recouped himself by laughing slyly at the humours of the more energetic. He has a hit at Allinson for building; drily tells us how Capt Stamper wonâ€™t pay his tithes; how Miss Lucas signs the Captainâ€™s cheques for him. The outlay these flashy newcomers make on their field & farms makes him sardonic. But he wont raise a finger either way; likes his cup of Indian tea, which he prefers to China, & doesnâ€™t much mind what anybody thinks. He smokes endless cigarettes, & his fingers are not very clean. Talking of his well, he said â€œIt would be a different thing if one wanted bathsâ€â€”which for some 70 years, presumably, he has done without. Then he likes a little practical talk about Aladdin lamps, for instance, & how the Rector at Iford has a device by which he makes the globe of the Veritas lamp wh. is cheaper serve. It appears that the Aladdin costs 10d & 2/-. But it blackens suddenly & is useless. Leaning over stiles, it is of lamp mantles that the two rectors talk. Or he will advise about making a garage: how Percy shd. cut a trench, & then old Fears should line the walls with cement. That is what he advises; & I fancy many many hours of his life have passed hobnobbing with Percys & Fears, about cement & trenches. Of his clerical character there is little visible. He would not buy Bowen a riding school he said; her sister did that. He didnâ€™t believe in it. She has a school at Rottingdean, keeps 12 horses, employs grooms, & has to be at it all day, Sundays included. But having expressed his opinion in the family conclave, he would leave it at that. Mrs H. would back Bowen. She would get her way. The Rector would slouch off to his study, where he does, heaven knows what. I asked him if he had work to do: a question which amused him a little. Not work he said; but a young woman to see. And then he settled into the armchair again, & so sat out a visit of over an hour & a half.
