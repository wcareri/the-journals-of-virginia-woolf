### Saturday 23 July

This is very near the end of the London season. I go to Ethelâ€™s at Dieppe (Iâ€™m rather proud of crossing the channel again) on Wednesday, then back to Newhaven, where I may be met by my own car. Since making the last entry I have learnt enough to drive a car in the country alone. On the backs of paper I write down instructions for starting cars. We have a nice light little shut up car in which we can travel thousands of miles. It is very dark blue, with a paler line round it. The world gave me this for writing The Lighthouse, I reflect, a book which has now sold 3,160 (perhaps) copies: will sell 3,500 before it dies, & thus far exceeds any other of mine.

The night I did not go to Stravinsky Desmond came, tender & garrulous & confidential. I remember leaning with him out of the window. He was full of love for everyone. He said he loved the way Melinda cratched her head or put on her gloves. He said he was now in love with his children. When Derraod asks him for a new perspective for his microscope he feels what he used to feel when he was in love with a woman. He resents his gift of money a little, since he was making Â£2,000 a year; but then he had â€˜arrearsâ€™; & has now, evidentlyâ€”Â£200 to the Bank, Â£200 for income tax & so on. We talked of love owing to Clive. For that night after I dined with Clive & went through some rather artificial gambols with Christa (who has always thought of me as Virginia; & canâ€™t quite lose the sense of my being a perfect lady â€œLook at those handsâ€) Clive walked me round, & standing under the lamp expressed his complete disillusion. â€œMy dear Virginia, life is over. Thereâ€™s no good denying it. Weâ€™re 45. Iâ€™m bored, Iâ€™m bored, Iâ€™m unspeakably bored. I know my own reactions. I know what Iâ€™m going to say. Iâ€™m not interested in a thing. Pictures bore me. I take up a book & put it down. No oneâ€™s interested in what I think any more. I go about thinking about suicide. I admire you for having tried to kill yourself.â€ To think that I should be listening to this in the moonlight from Clive! And he spoke with such dreary good sense too. I could scarcely whip up any ardour of denial. It was all true, it seemed to me. Not, indeed, true of me, but true of him. & so I feebly asked him to come & see me; & I would prove that I was interested in him. He agreed half heartedly, waved his hand, & went off, thinking about suicide. Then we met next night at Raymonds. Hardly had I come into the room but he started up boasting & professing, perfunctorily a little, but boldly enough. He had had an adventure. Life was changed; had met the loveliest of women, seemed the nicest too, was an aristocrat; she had been kind to him; would Raymond come on to supper on Monday? All this was blustered out, with many a cuff at me (for he always wishes he says to hurt meâ€”even over a motor car) & it was about Valerie Taylor, an actress, whom he had met lunching at the Maclagans. For my own part, I am once more at the stage of thinking Clive â€˜second rateâ€™. It is all so silly, shallow, & selfish. Granted the charm of his vitality, still one would prefer a finer taste to it. How angry his â€˜secondratenessâ€™ used to make me, in connection with Nessa. Now I think of it much less often, but I suppose the feeling is there. All this summer he has twanged so persistently on the one string that one gets bored. Love love loveâ€”Clive, Clive, Cliveâ€”thatâ€™s the tune of it, thrummed with rather callous persistency; a thick finger & thumb. Now love I dare say nothing against; but it is a feeble passion, I mean a gross dull passion, when it has no part in it of imagination, intellect, poetry. Cliveâ€™s love is three parts vanity. Now that he can say, or lie, Iâ€™ve been to bed with Valerie, his self love is assuaged. He remains Clive the undaunted lover, the Don Juan of Bloomsbury; & whether its true or not, so long as we think it true, scarcely matters. But I own that he pesters me with his jealousy, or whatever it is, does his best to annoy me, & so Iâ€™m not quite the impartial judge I might be. The interesting question remainsâ€”why does he always wish to hurt me?

So Desmond & I discussed all this. And The Lighthouse too; & I felt, susceptible as I am, heâ€™s doing this partly to thank me for having been generous to him. But I am enough mistress of myself now to let these feelings flow & not disturb my pleasure.

All images are now tinged with driving a motor. Here I think of letting my engine work, with my clutch out.

It has been, on the whole, a fresh well ordered summer. I am not so parched with talk as usual. I have dipped into society more easily. My illness in May was a good thing in some ways; for I got control of society at an early stage, & circumvented my headache, without a complete smash. Thus it has been a free quiet summer: I enjoyed the Eclipse; I enjoyed Long Barn; (where I went twice) I enjoyed sitting with Vita at Kew for 3 or 4 hours under a cloudy sky, & dining at the Petit Riche with her; she refreshes me, & solaces me; I have worked very methodically & done my due of articles, so that with luck, I shall have made Â£120 over my proper sum by September. That is I shall have made Â£320 by journalism, & I suppose at least Â£300 by my novel this year. I have thought too much, though on purpose, with my eyes open, of making money; & once we have each a nest egg I should like to let that sink into my sub-consciousness, & earn easily what we need. Bruce Richmond is coming to tea on Monday to discuss an article on Morgan; & I am going to convey to him the fact that I canâ€™t always refuse Â£60 in America for the Timesâ€™ Â£10. If I could make easily Â£350 a year, I would: if I could get some settled job.

At Rodmell I am going, seriously, to begin my book on fiction. With luck I might have this done by January. Then I shall have the Moths full in my brain to pour out. I am keeping it standing a long time, & rather fear that it may lose its freshness. Dadie has involved us (is the word wrong?) with Peter. Dadie dines with Topsy & she pumps him about the Wolves & Peterâ€™s book. Dadie wants to crab it & puts it on to us. Leonard says it doesnâ€™t do; Virginia thinks it â€˜Academicâ€™. The result is a long angry letter from Peter, half vanity, half righteous indignation; but we have explained, & all the burden now rests on Dadie. (& partly on me, for Topsy says I wrote her a rude letter about Jane Austen, but this has been explained).

The Press is going on. Novels are the great bloodsuckers. Maryâ€™s book will cost us Â£100; & we shall lose too on The Marionettes. So in the past two days I have rejected Butts & Daglish & Littell; I fancy that we donâ€™t do as well as we should with novels. And Iâ€™m exposed to the hanging lips & clamorous vanity of Lucy Clifford today: she has an article on George Eliot which she wrote for a special fee (that is where I shall end if I dont take careâ€”talking always of â€˜feesâ€™) for the Nineteenth Century. Gottstalk is finished.
