Vita back; unchanged, though I daresay oneâ€™s relation changes from day to day. Clive & she together. I think Clive is pretty miserable: his stay at Cassis a failure, so far as writing goes. And then the question rises, has he not gone too far in eating, drinking, love making, to stop dead now? He seemed random & unsettled, much as when he left, only now with no absolute hard arm to cling to, as he fancied when he went to Cassis. He talked (always shifting away from himself yet returning, ambiguously to that centre) about going mad: sometimes thought he was going mad; then how oneâ€™s life was over; one was spent, played out; this was clear when one saw Julian & Quentin. After all, its an ignominious position to have made the grand refusal, & gone back on it. Mary was at the opera, on a hot evening like this think of listening to Wagner, he said. Thereâ€™s Saxon upstairs, Mary & Sibyl Colefax below. This was all said half enviously, yet doubtfully; as if not knowing what line to take.

My book. What is the use of saying one is indifferent to reviews when positive praise, though mingled with blame, gives one such a start on, that instead of feeling dried up, one feels, on the contrary, flooded with ideas? I gather from vague hints, through Margery Joad, through Clive, that some people say it is my best book. So far Vita praises; Dotty enthuses; an unknown donkey writes. No one has yet read it to the end, I daresay; & I shall hover about, not anxious but worried for 2 more weeks, when it will be over.
