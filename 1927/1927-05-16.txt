The book. Now on its feet so far as praise is concerned. It has been out 10 daysâ€”Thursday a week ago. Nessa enthusiasticâ€”a sublime, almost upsetting spectacle. She says it is an amazing portrait of mother; a supreme portrait painter; has lived in it; found the rising of the dead almost painful. Then Ottoline, then Vita, then Charlie, then Lord Olivier, then Tommie, then Clive: poor Cliveâ€”he came in, ostensibly to praise this â€˜amazing bookâ€”far the best youâ€™ve ever writtenâ€™ but found Eddie who imposed himself resolutely, sharply; & so sat on, but how wandering & unhappy. I have scarcely seen him in this mood ever beforeâ€”like a person awaked from a sweet dream. But what is it? A disillusionment? A shock? He sees Mary. Has he lost faith? Has the dancing mist of rhapsody failed himâ€”he who was based so solidly on such beef & beer or champagne rather. Suppose one woke & found oneself a fraud? It was part of my madnessâ€”that horror. But then as Clive said, you go mad but you bound up againâ€”the inference being that he was to stay mad.

Sold 1802 of The L.: if it makes 3,000 I shall be as they say more than content. Mervyn deadâ€”did I record; & I haunted for a time by the sight of his prim pinched face, with the nice blue eyes, so suddenly stilled: so unseasonably. The eye plays a large part in these affairs.
