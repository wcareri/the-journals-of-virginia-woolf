### Saturday 22 October

This is a book, I think I have said before, which I write after tea. And my brain was full of ideas, but I have spent them on Mr Ashcroft & Miss Findlater, fervent admirers.

â€œI shall let myself dash this in for a weekâ€â€”I have done nothing, nothing, nothing else for a fortnight; & am launched somewhat furtively but with all the more passion upon Orlando: A Biography. It is to be a small book, & written by Christmas. I thought I could combine it with Fiction, but once the mind gets hot it cant stop; I walk making up phrases; sit contriving scenes; am in short in the thick of the greatest rapture known to me; from which I have kept myself since last February, or earlier. Talk of planning a book, or waiting for an idea! This one came in a rush; I said to pacify myself, being bored & stale with criticism & faced with that intolerable dull Fiction, â€œYou shall write a page of a story for a treat: you shall stop sharp at 11.30 & then go on with the Romanticsâ€. I had very little idea what the story was to be about. But the relief of turning my mind that way about was such that I felt happier than for months; as if put in the sun, or laid on cushions; & after two days entirely gave up my time chart & abandoned myself to the pure delight of this farce: which I enjoy as much as Iâ€™ve ever enjoyed anything; & have written myself into half a headache & had to come to a halt, like a tired horse, & take a little sleeping draught last night: which made our breakfast fiery. I did not finish my egg. I am writing Orlando half in a mock style very clear & plain, so that people will understand every word. But the balance between truth & fantasy must be careful. It is based on Vita, Violet Trefusis, Lord Lascelles, Knole &c.

A great many incidents to record. They come always in a rush together, these bright October days, with every one just back, fresh from solitude, cheerful, busy, sociable. Nessa has initiated, informally, Sunday evenings; & there Old Bloomsbury is to gather, after dinnerâ€”Helen Clive Roger & so on.

Then I asked the time in the Press a week ago.

â€œLeonard can tell youâ€ said Angus very huffily.

â€œAsk Angus. I dont seem to knowâ€ said Leonard very grumpy. And I saw Mrs C. lower her head over her typing & laugh. This was the tail of a terrific quarrel about the time between them. Angus was dismissed; but tells Nessa he wants to stay, could tempers be made compatible. A bad year, this, financially, for the Press: yet prospects seem flourishing, if only Marys & Braithwaites didnâ€™t eat up all profits. Dottie (who comes to tea with great simplicity, but sits a little long afterwards) is investing her Â£200 a year in Stella Gibbons &c. & lends me her own poems, which I promptly throw down the W.C. Vita stalks into the press, all red & black (so is Orlando) says Lizzie has been shot by a farmer, no, a publican (she respects farmers, not publicans): comes up here with me, & Harold drops in to say Good bye. We sit very cosy & intimate for all his man about the worldiness, over the gas: he has just been to the Foreign Office & they have been â€œever so good. Really they spoil oneâ€ he said, being devoted to the Office, which now sends him to Berlin for 3 years. Vita will only go for a short time she says. She likes him. She pets him: wants me to make him a fresh cup of tea.

Then thereâ€™s Clive. He has laid his stairs with the vividest green, 5 inches thick: has every comfort & convenience. I dine there to meet Harold & Tom: Tom, of course, in white waistcoat, much the man of the world; which sets the key, & off they go telling stories about â€˜Jeanâ€™ (Cocteau) about Ada Leverson, Gosse, Valery, &c. &c. & L. & I feel a little Bloomsburyish perhaps; no, I think this sort of talk is hardly up to the scratch. Harold does it best. He was in Petersburg when they blew up Stolypin, or his children; can describe the boom bum bum of a bomb falling from the life: & the Empress with her yellow eye whites; & King George throwing Mr Britling with a violence to the floor. & I â€˜may be lacking in distinction but Iâ€™m damned if Iâ€™m an alienâ€™ was his comment on some phrase of Wellsâ€™.

And that reminds me how we saw the pale dove grey coffin of Mrs Wells slide through the gates at Golders Green. It had tassels like bell pulls on it. Wells sat in bottle blue overcoat by Shaw, sobbing. One saw his white handkerchief going in & out of his pocket. Mr Page a shaggy shabby old scholar, read some typewritten sheets, by Wells, about â€œour friend Caroline.â€ â€œPoor things, poor silly things sheâ€™d say, in their days of ill repute. This colloquialism merged in the burial service; & somehow the whole effect was a little nondescript. The aim was to emphasise life; & generosity & how generous lives continue; one thing touched me. â€œSome are set on a headland & their lives are a beacon to mankind. Others live retired & are hardly known; but their lives are the most preciousâ€ which reminds me of what my father wrote, & meant at the moment, of my mother. Then the coffin slid away â€œinto the furnace of material creationâ€. She had become part of the roses she loved, & of the sun on snow. Poor Jane! It was desperate to see what a dowdy shabby imperfect lot we looked; how feeble; how ugly for the most part. And yet we were doing our best to say something sincere about our great adventure (as Wells almost called it). And he has been adventurous & plunged about in his bath & splashed the waters, to give him his due. Afterwards we stood about congratulating; Lydia sobbed; Shaw said â€œYou mustnt cry. Jane is wellâ€”Jane is splendidâ€ & we went offâ€”I to Fortnum & Masonâ€™s to buy shoes.
