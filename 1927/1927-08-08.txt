I was to have written here such a brilliant account of my 3 days at Dieppe. It was to have sprung, suddenly, in a beautiful fountain, out of the table in the window at (name forgotten) overlooking the Seine. The Seine there is very broad, & round the bend come constantly steamers, Norwegian, with petrol, English French; & Nan kept looking to read their names, showing in all she did a sort of nervous tremulous pride in France (or do I imagine this?) which hints at the fact that she likes their life there, alone at Auppegard, better than Ethel. â€œIâ€™m gregariousâ€ said Ethel a little waspishly, for she is brittle & acid, the spoilt pet of the more dour & upstanding Nan. We were, I think, looking over the cliff with the churchyard on it, the tombstones standing up against the blue sea. But I was to have written this, & now shall not, I suppose.â€”It is a very narrow house, all window, laid with pale bright Samarcand rugs, & painted greens & blues, with lovely â€˜piecesâ€™, & great pots of carefully designed flowers arranged by Loomas. A white bull terrier stalks from room to room, one ear bent over in his fights. Nan, stylishly dressed, sews dusters of an evening, & Ethel craves talk. Nessa & Duncan say that the talk skirts & flits & never settles very long; in fact that the house is built upon the finest silver wood ash: so soft so silver you donâ€™t at first notice how it gets into your throat & makes your skin dry & dusty. We have motored most days.

We opened one little window when we bought the gramophone; now another/ opens with the motorâ€”I was going to say, but stopped.
