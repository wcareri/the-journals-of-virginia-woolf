### Monday 11 July

Waiting for what I do not exactly know. In a mood of random restlessnessâ€”Nelly having for 125th time â€˜given noticeâ€™ this morning. Shall I go to Ashley Gardens & engage Mrs Collins & her daughter? I am sick of the timid spiteful servant mind; yet perhaps Mrs Collins will be of the same feather. Never mind.

A great storm has torn off one wing of my double windows. But I have never mentioned the absorbing subjectâ€”the subject which has filled our thoughts to the exclusion of Clive & Mary & literature & death & lifeâ€”motor cars. Every evening we go round with Pinker for a game in Gordon Sqreâ€”I talk as if the evenings had been fineâ€”no, we sit there in between the sulphur coloured storms; under the shelter of trees with the rain pattering between the leaves. We talk of nothing but cars. Then, sometimes, word is brought that Mrs Bell is at the door in her car. I rush out, & find her, rather nervously in control of a roomy shabby Renault with Fred beside her. Three times I have been for a little tour with her. And yesterday we commissioned Fred to find us & bring instantly to our door, a Singer. We have decided on a Singer. And, the reason why I am distracted now is that Fred is going to ring me up & say if I am to have my first lesson this evening. The sun is shining; the trees dripping. Possibly I may go.

This is a great opening up in our lives. One may go to Bodiam, to Arundel, explore the Chichester downs, expand that curious thing, the map of the world in ones mind. It will I think demolish loneliness, & may of course imperil complete privacy. The Keynesâ€™ have one tooâ€”a cheap one. Nessa thinks it will break down at once. Nessa takes a very sinister view of the Keynesâ€™. She anticipates ruin of every sort for them, with some pleasure too. Hereâ€™s Leonardâ€”So then I tell him about the storm, about the telephones, & about Pinker. Then Sibyl who has cut me these 3 months, suddenly writes to say she has been â€˜unwellâ€™, & will I come to tea. No I wont. And now I must quickly dress for Cliveâ€™s party, where I am to meet Cory & Nessa & Duncan & Christabel: for thereâ€™s a plethora of parties this week, & tomorrow Iâ€™m missing Lydia & Stravinsky; but a kind of philosophy protects me: I shall make out a happy evening somehow; & find a curious pleasure in staying away, imagining. So I must stop & write to Sibyl. With any luck The Lighthouse will reach 3,000 this week.
