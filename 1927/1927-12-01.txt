A rapid note about the lunch party, L. dining at the Cranium.

An art of light talk; about people. Bogey Harris; Maurice Baring. B.H. â€˜knowsâ€™ everyone: that is no one. Freddy Fossle? Oh yes I know him; knows Ly So & So; knows everyone: cant admit to not knowing. A polished, burnished diner out. Roman Catholic. In the middle M. Baring saysâ€”But Lady Beaverbrook died this morning. Sibyl says Say that again. But BM. was lunching with her yesterday, says Bogey. Well its in the papers: sheâ€™s dead says M.B. Sibyl says But she was quite young. Lord Ivor asked me to meet the young man her daughterâ€™s to marry. I know Lord Ivor says, or wd say Bogey. Well its odd, says Sibyl, giving up the attempt to wrestle with the death of the young at a lunch party. So on to wigs: Lady Charlie used to have hers curled by a sailor on deck before she got up says Bogey. Oh Iâ€™ve known her all my life. Went yatchting with them. Lady â€¦ eyebrows fell into the soup. Sir John Cook was so fat they had to hike him up. Once he got out of bed in the middle of the night & fell on the floor where he lay 5 hoursâ€”couldnâ€™t move. BM. sent me a pear by the waiter with a long letter. Talk of houses & periods. All very smooth & surface talk: depends on knowing people: not on saying anything interesting. Bogeyâ€™s cheeks are polished daily.
