### Wednesday 5 October

I write in the sordid doss house atmosphere of approaching departure. Pinker is asleep in one chair; Leonard is signing cheques at the little deal table under the glare of the lamp. The fire is covered with ashes, since we have been burning it all day, & Mrs Bâ . never cleans. Envelopes lie in the grate. I am writing with a pen which is feeble & wispy; & it is a sharp fine evening with a sunset, I daresay.

We went to Amberley yesterday & think of buying a house there. For it is an astonishing forgotten lovely place, between water meadows & downs. So impulsive we both are, in spite of our years.

But we are not as old as Mrs Gray, who came to thank us for our apples. She wonâ€™t send to buy, as it looks like begging, since we never take money. Her face is cut into by wrinkles: they make wheals across her. She is 86, & can never remember such a summer. In her youth it was so hot in April often that they couldnâ€™t bear a sheet on them. Her youth must have been almost the same time as my fathers. She is 9 years younger, I make out: born in 1841. And what did she see of Victorian England I wonder?

I can make up situations, but I cannot make up plots. That is: if I pass the lame girl, I can without knowing I do it, instantly make up a scene: (now I cant think of one). This is the germ of such fictitious gift as I have. And by the way I get letter after letter about my books, & they scarcely please me.

Further, we met Mary & Barbara in Brighton yesterday; grey, tailor made, elegant, with a touch of pink, & pink silk legs. Yet I fancied some wrinkles about Maryâ€™s eyes; & a sharp line or two, made by Clive. We were affable, as people are when they meet after a coolness; we gave them buns. We were extra affable, perhaps; & the shadow of Clive loomed above us. Going to fetch L.â€™s hat from Charleston I chanced on one of those evening autumn emotional hours when people want to be intimate, perhaps to boast. And he told me an absurd romantic storyâ€”of a girl, lovely, desired, half his age; & how she loved him, & he could not believe it; she must think me a cultivated elderly man, he said; & so â€œI try I try to control myselfâ€ but, wondrously, they went off the other day; had 4 days perfect bliss; & now â€œthe drama beginsâ€. That is, it began two days ago, on Monday. Nobody has the least idea who she is. And is it lasting, or genuine, or only a set off against Mary? & will it survive Maryâ€™s attacks, & shall we be dragged in, & so on & so on? Those are the thoughts which agitate us this October, which is the birth of the year.

If my pen allowed, I should now try to make out a work table, having done my last article for the Tribune, & now being free again. And instantly the usual exciting devices enter my mind: a biography beginning in the year 1500 & continuing to the present day, called Orlando: Vita; only with a change about from one sex to another. I think, for a treat, I shall let myself dash this in for a week, while
