Woman haters depress me, & both Tolstoi & Mrs Asquith hate women. I suppose my depression is a form of vanity. But then so are all strong opinions on both sides. I hate Mrs A.â€™s hard, dogmatic empty style. But enough: I shall write about her tomorrow: I write every day about something, & have deliberately set apart a few weeks to money making, so that I may put Â£50 in each of our pockets by September. This will be the first money of my own since I married. I never felt the need of it till lately. And I can get it, if I want it, but shirk writing for money.

Cliveâ€™s father died yesterday. Harold Nicolson & Duncan dined with us, & Nessa came in afterwards, very silent, inscrutable &, perhaps critical. As a family we distrust anyone outside our set, I think. We too definitely decide that so & so has not the necessary virtues. I daresay Harold has not got them; at the same time, there is a good deal in him I like: he is quick & rash & impulsive; not in our sense, very clever; uneasy; seeming young; on the turn from diplomat to intellectual; not Vitaâ€™s match; but honest & cordial. L. says heâ€™s too commonplace. I liked my little duet with him. He wears a green, or blue, shirt & tie; is sunburnt; chubby, pertâ [?]; vivacious. Talked of politics, but was flimsy compared with Leonardâ€”I thought. Said it was with L. & me that he felt completely at his ease. Told stories wh. sound rather empty in the bare Bloomsbury rooms.
