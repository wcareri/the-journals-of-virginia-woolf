### Thursday 5 May

Book out. We have sold (I think) 1690 before publicationâ€”twice Dalloway. I write however in the shadow of the damp cloud of the Times Lit Sup. review, which is an exact copy of the JsR. Mrs Dalloway review, gentlemanly, kindly, timid & praising beauty, doubting character, & leaving me moderately depressed. I am anxious about Time Passes. Think the whole thing may be pronounced soft, shallow, insipid, sentimental. Yet, honestly, donâ€™t much care; want to be let alone to ruminate. Odd how strong this feeling is in me. Now I think we are safe to get our motor car. The next fortnight we shall both be depressed about our books.

Dined with the Wests last night, all solid, shiny, spread & spacious; as if they were settling in; wedding presents; clean covers, carpets, &c. all too handsome for my taste. Iâ€™m reverting to squalor as my milieu. And then why did she marry him? He is the type of any other cleyerish young journalist, common, glib: uneasy last night, lest we should talk of Angus. But we talked of Madge.

I know why I am depressed: a bad habit of making up the review I should like before reading the review I get. I am excited about my article on Poetry & Fiction. Writing for an audience always stirs me. I hope to avoid too many jokes. Then Vita will come tomorrow. But I dont want people: I want solitude; Rome.

Nelly away; Pinker away; Clive coming back; Opera in swing; Francis to see me about writing; fine spring weather.
