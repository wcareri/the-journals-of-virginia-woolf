### Wednesday 10 August

Yes, the motor is turning out the joy of our lives, an additional life, free & mobile & airy to live alongside our usual stationary industry. We spin off to Falmer, ride over the Downs, drop into Rottingdean, then sweep over to Seaford, call, in pouring rain at Charleston, pass the time of day with Cliveâ€”Nessa is at Bodiamâ€”return for tea, all as light & easy as a hawk in the air. Soon we shall look back at our pre-motor days as we do now at our days in the caves. After a week here, Leonard has become perfectly efficient; I am held back by insufficient lessons, but shall be expert before September is half through. Various little improvements in the house keep me on the thrill with hope & despair. Shall I lavish Â£5 that will be mine on a new spare bed?â€”alas, I fear I must; then the great & distasteful operations of furnishing will be over, & next year I shall add ornament & comfort. Perhaps if I make an extra sum we might build a bed sitting room for me in the attic, enlarge L.â€™s study, & so have a desirable, roomy, light house. For if we had Â£300 every year to spend, it is difficult to think of anything, except this, travel, & pocket money, to spend it on. Here at the age of 45 are Nessa & I growing little wings again after our lean years. She may rake in another Â£500; perhaps more. Already she has bought a roll of linoleum & a cupboard. But my state is precarious. With The Lighthouse I may just have climbed to the top of my hill; or again we may wobble back; my journalism may pall on the Americans: no rich father in law will endow me; but Heaven knows, have not much anxiety. We are flexible, adventurous still I hope.

An odd incident, psychologically as the vanished Kot used to say, has been Morganâ€™s serious concern about my article on him. Did I care a straw what he said about me? Was it more laudatory? Yet here is this self-possessed, aloof man taking every word to heart, cast down to the depths, apparently, because I do not give him superlative rank, & writing again & again to ask about it, or suggest about it, anxious that it shall be published in England, & also that more space shall be given to the Passage to India. Had I been asked, I should have said that of all writers he would be the most indifferent & cool under criticism. And he minds a dozen times more than I do, who have the opposite reputation.

This brings me back to those last days in London when I called on Ottoline, had a shabby easy intimate talk with her, & then, inadvertently as if by touching a button brought on me the whole shower bath of Philipâ€™s affection. He came the next day, inconveniently, & the day after when Sibyl was there. Once more I felt the uneasy excitement of â€˜loveâ€™, that is of physical desire making someone restless, too restless & emotional to talk simply. But L. came in; Pinker came in, & the amorous Philip, who has lost most of his good looks & is coarse as an old ram, had to leave. But I found a letter at Rodmell, quoting J.â€™s Roomâ€”â€˜Come back to me Darlingâ€™â€”with which I shall make Vita jealous tomorrow. But what course to take, especially now that he is our neighbour, I do not altogether know; nor whether to answer his letter or not.

This, however, is Nellyâ€™s first evening back, in the flush of good temper, with Gladys, & I am beginning to think of my dinner. Since I dined at Auppegard I cannot be said to have dined at all: ham & eggs; cheese & raspberries; once a baked puddingâ€”so we have fed at the hands of poor emaciated Mrs Bartholomew.
