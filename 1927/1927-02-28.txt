### Monday 28 February

& I have got into another stream of thought, if thought it can be called.  
Let me collect a few logs, drifting in my mind, to represent the past few days.  
Clive, standing at the door.  
She cries for the moon.  
This was said of Mary. With it he went to Cassis for 3 months.  
Again, If Mrs Woolf dont think me worth a penny stamp I saidâ€”this being Rose Bartholomew standing at her cottage door on Friday evening. Phrases suddenly seem to me very significant, & then I forget them. My brain is rather stale. Do I like The Lighthouse? I think I was disappointed. But God knows. I have to read it again.  
A letter from Vita & Dottie just come. She is not an explicit letter writer. But I must be fond of her, genuinely, to start as I did at the sight of Dottieâ€™s hand, thinking she wrote to say V. was ill.

For the rest I think Cowper is a good poet. Iâ€™d like to write about him. Shall we go to Greece, Italy or France? Iâ€™m glad I didnâ€™t dedicate my book to Roger. This I verified in his presence, the other night. He dined here with Raymond. Raymond is intellectually speaking underbred. Roger a pure aristocrat. Philip came in, his little green eyes hazed bunged up with drink. So to Rodmell. And now the wind is making the tin screen over the gas fire rattle. How we protect ourselves from the elements! Coming back last night I thought, owing to civilisation, I, who am now cold, wet, & hungry, can be warm & satisfied & listening to a Mozart 4tet in 15 minutes. And so I was.

That ring may be Tom. No. Tom dont run upstairsâ€”only the lower classes do that.

And I dont think I shall go out in the rain, though I am going to spend this week in long romantic London walks. I have successfully broken the neck of that screaming grey gooseâ€”society. Thereâ€™s nothing to be afraid of in dining with Ethel or Sibylâ€”& Iâ€™m shingled now. One spins round for a moment & then settles on oneâ€™s feet. But about the Soul: the soul has sunk to the bottom. I am empty headed tonight, feeling the lack of Nessa rather, & all the prelude of Springâ€”the vague discomfort & melancholy & a feeling of having come to anchor. But I intend to work harder & harder. If theyâ€”the respectables, my friends, advise me against The Lighthouse, I shall write memoirs; have a plan already to get historical manuscripts & write Lives of the Obscure: but why do I pretend I should take advice? After a holiday the old ideas will come to me as usual; seeming fresher, more important than ever; & I shall be off again, feeling that extraordinary exhilaration, that ardour & lust of creationâ€”which is odd, if what I create is, as it well may be, wholly bad.

Today I bought a new watch. Last night I crept into L.â€™s bed to make up a sham quarrel about paying our fares to Rodmell. Now to finish Passage to India.
