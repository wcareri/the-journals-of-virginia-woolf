### Thursday 3 February

Fate always contrives that I begin the new year in February. I ask, why another volume? (but hereâ€™s an innovation: this is not a book but a blockâ€”so lazy am I about making writing books nowadays). What is the purpose of them? L. taking up a volume the other day said Lord save him if I died first & he had to read through these. My handwriting deteriorates. And do I say anything interesting? I can always waste an idle hour reading them; & then, oh yes, I shall write my memoirs out of them, one of these days.

That reminds me of the Webbs: those 36 strenuous hours at Liphook, in an emphatic lodging house, with blue books in the passages; & those entirely devotedâ€”by which I mean those entirely integrated people. Their secret is that they have by nature no divisions of soul to fritter them away: their impact is solid & entire. Without eyes & ears (but Mrs Webb listens in & prefers Mozart to Handel, if I may guess) one can come down with more of a weight upon bread & butter or whatever the substance is before one. On a steely watery morning we swiftly tramped over a heathy common talking, talking. In their efficiency & glibness one traces perfectly adjusted machinery; but talk by machinery does not charm, or suggest: it cuts the grass of the mind close at the roots. Iâ€™m too hurried to write. Mrs W. is far less ornamental than of old: wispy untidy drab, with a stain on her skirt & a key on her watch chain; as if she had cleared the decks & rolled her sleeves & was waiting for the end, but working.
