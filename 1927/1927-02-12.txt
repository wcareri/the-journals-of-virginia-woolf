### Saturday 12 February

Exactly what has happened in the Clive Mary affair I cannot say. Did he not sheepishly admit in the kitchen the other night that he was putting it off till March? & then, casually & jauntily tell me as if by chance, the other afternoon, here, that he was going after all. But wont Mary mind? What if she does?â€”that was practically his answer.

Vitaâ€™s prose is too fluent. Iâ€™ve been reading it, & it makes my pen run. When Iâ€™ve read a classic, I am curbed &â€”not castrated: no, the opposite; I cant think of the word at the moment.

Had I been writing Pâ assenger to Tâ eheran I should have run off whole pools of this coloured water; & then (I think) found my own method of attack. It is my distinction as a writer I think to get this clear & my expression exact. Were I writing travels I should wait till some angle emerged: & go for that. The method of writing smooth narrative cant be right; things dont happen in oneâ€™s mind like that. But she is very skilful & golden voiced.

This makes me think that I have to read To the L. tomorrow & Monday, straight through in print; straight through, owing to my curious methods, for the first time. I want to read largely & freely once: then to niggle over details.

But I am forgetting, after 3 days, the most important event in my life since marriageâ€”so Clive described it: Bobo shingled me. Mr Cizec has bingled me. I am short haired for life. Having no longer, I think, any claims to beauty, the convenience of this alone makes it desirable. Every morning I go to take up brush & twist that old coil round my finger & fix it with hairpins & then with a start of joy, no I neednâ€™t. In front there is no change; behind Iâ€™m like the rump of a partridge. This robs dining out of half its terrors; in token of which, Iâ€™m â€˜dining outâ€™ (the distinction is clear: Roger & Clive & Bloomsbury aint dining out) with Ethel & with the Hendersons.

For the restâ€”its been a gay tropical kind of autumn, with so much Vita & Knole & staying away: we have launched ourselves a little more freely perhaps from work & the Press. But now with Nessa away, Clive away, Duncan away, Vita away, the strenuous time sets in: Iâ€™m reading & writing at a great pace; mean to â€˜doâ€™ Morgan; have a fling at my book on fiction; & make all the money we want for Greece & a motor car. I may note that the first symptoms of Lighthouse are unfavourable. Roger, it is clear did not like Time Passes. Harpers & the Forum have refused serial rights; Brace writes, I think, a good deal less enthusiastically than of Mrs D. But these opinions refer to the rough copy, unrevised. And anyhow I feel callous: L.â€™s opinion keeps me steady; Iâ€™m neither one thing nor the other.

Yesterday Wells asked us to publish a pamphlet for him. This is a great rise in the world for us; & comes on top of rather a flat talk with Angus. L. says he doesnâ€™t â€œmanageâ€. Angus refuses to budge an inch. He canâ€™t see the point of it. As he says, too, whats he to do if he leaves? He doesnâ€™t want to leave. Though sometimes â€˜fed upâ€™ he likes it better than most work. But Iâ€™m persuaded we need, the press needs, a fanatic at the moment; not this quiet easygoing gentlemanliness. I am annoyed at doing cards, & envelopes; & L. does twice the work I do.
