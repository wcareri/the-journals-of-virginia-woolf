### Tuesday 20 September

A thousand things to be written had I time: had I power. A very little writing uses up my capacity for writing:

Laughton Place & Philip Ritchieâ€™s death

These as it happened, synchronised. When Vita was here 10 days ago we drove over to Laughton, & I broke in, & explored the house. It seemed, that sunny morning, so beautiful, so peaceful; & as if it had endless old rooms. So I came home boiling with the idea of buying it; & so fired L. that we wrote to the farmer, Mr Russell, & waited, all on wires, edgy, excited for an answer. He came himself, after some days; & we were to go & see it. This arranged, & our hopes very high, I opened the Morning Post & read the death of Philip Ritchie. â€œHe cant take houses, poor Philipâ€ I thought. And then the usual procession of images went through my mind. Also, I think for the first time, I felt this death leaves me an elderly laggard; makes me feel I have no right to go on; as if my life were at the expense of his. And I had not been kind; not asked him to dinner & so on. So the two feelingsâ€”about buying the house & his deathâ€”fought each other: & sometimes the house won & sometimes death won; & we went to see the house & it turned out unspeakably dreary; all patched & spoilt; with grained oak & grey paper; a sodden garden & a glaring red cottage at the back. I note the strength & vividness of feelings which suddenly break & foam away. Now I forget to think about Philip Ritchie.

One of these days, though, I shall sketch here, like a grand historical picture, the outlines of all my friends. I was thinking of this in bed last night, & for some reason I thought I would begin with a sketch of Gerald Brenan. There may be something in this idea. It might be a way of writing the memoirs of oneâ€™s own times during peoples lifetimes. It might be a most amusing book. The question is how to do it. Vita should be Orlando, a young nobleman. There should be Lytton. & it should be truthful; but fantastic. Roger. Duncan. Clive. Adrian. Their lives should be related. But I can think of more books than I shall ever be able to write. How many little stories come into my head! For instance: Ethel Sands not looking at her letters. What this implies. One might write a book of short significant separate scenes. She did not open her letters.

We motored to Long Barn & back yesterday, through suburbs for the most part. All Hampstead, red, sanitary, earnest, view gazing, breeze requiring is lodged in the heights of Ashdown Forest. Now & again one comes on something consciously preserved like the Wren house at Groombridge. One stops the motor & looks. So do other motorists. We found Vita & Dotty sitting over a log fire. Dottie is going to spend Â£200 a year on poetry: to edit a series of books of unsaleable poetry. This Â£200 she was giving to the Poetry Bookshop, but deterred by his earnestness & his drunkenness she is crying off: & has laid it at our feet. There will be much comment she says at this. People will say she is buying her way into Bloomsbury. The children were there; Nigel very shabby: Vita dressed him as a Russian boy â€œDont. It makes me look like a little girlâ€ he said. There was the French tutor who never spoke. Dotty byronic in her dress, but much improved over the London Dotty. They do not yet know what is to become of Harold, who has refused to go to Buda Pesth.

And Quentin came, & the Keynesâ€™s came, & Morgan came. All of this I meant, perhaps, to describe: but then how hard I drive my pen through one article after anotherâ€”Hemingway, Morgan, Shelley; & now Biography.

Quentin wont let us play him Wagner: prefers Bach. Nessaâ€™s children are terrifyingly sophisticated: so Morgan said when Angelica, rigged up in a long black shawl, acted Lady Cornflax & Lady Ottoline at Charleston. They have grown up without any opposition: nothing to twist or stunt. Hence they have reached stages at 16 or 17 which I reached only at 26 or 27.

But the summer, has never burnt; & is now ashes. Already at half past five the light out here is greyish; the wind swirling; all children indoors; & I shall write a letter or two & go into the house: sit over a fire & read, I think, biography.

But we are very happyâ€”seldom more so, I think. Perhaps things are doing rather well. Theres the motor; Dottieâ€™s Â£200;â€”& L. said about Laughton Place the other day, â€œThe strange thing is that we always come to the same opinion about thingsâ€â€”which pleased me.
