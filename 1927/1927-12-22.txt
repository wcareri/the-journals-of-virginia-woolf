### Thursday 22 December

I just open this for a moment, being dull of the head, to enter a severe reprimand of myself to myself. The value of society is that it snubs one. I am meretricious, mediocre; a humbug; am getting into the habit of flashy talk. Tinsel it seemed last night at the Keynes. I was out of humour & so could see the transparency of my own sayings. Dadie said a true thing too: when V. lets her style get on top of her, one thinks only of that; when she uses clichÃ©s, one thinks what she means. But, he says, I have no logical power & live & write in an opium dream. And the dream is too often about myself.

Now with middle age drawing on, & age ahead it is important to be severe on such faults. So easily might I become a hare brained egotistic woman, exacting compliments, arrogant, narrow, withered. Nessaâ€™s children (I always measure myself against her, & find her much the largest, most humane of the two of us, think of her now with an admiration that has no envy in it: with some trace of the old childish feeling that we were in league together against the world; & how proud I am of her triumphant winning of all our battles: as she her way so nonchalantly modestly, almost anonymously past the goal, with her children round her; & only a little added tenderness (a moving thing in her) which shows me that she too feels wonder surprise at having passed so many terrors & sorrows safeâ€”

The dream is too often about myself. To correct this, & to forget oneâ€™s own sharp absurd little personality, reputation & the rest of it, one should read; see outsiders; think more; write more logically; above all be full of work; & practise anonymity. Silence in company; or the quietest statement, not the showiest, is also â€˜indicatedâ€™ as the doctors say. It was an empty party, rather, last night. Very nice here, though; & F.B. is I think willing.
