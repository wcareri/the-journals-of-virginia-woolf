### Wednesday 30 November

I have just been upstairs & tried on a hat (18/11) which I have just bought at B&H (so they call it) to wear at Sibylâ€™s lunch party tomorrow. With that money I could have bought a nightgown. Then I heard a man in a bus talk about quality & state of gentlemaness; & you would call me Sir; as I you Madam. This to a working woman, dowdy pasty plush with a baby. â€œHad moreâ€™n 8â€ she said to the conductor; whom she called young man; & he called her Ma. This is Dickens; or Shakespeare; or simple English cockney: whichever it is I adore it; & warm the cockles of my heart at it.

A very happy autumn this, I repeat. Nelly raised Â£5, & for that reason or another in constant spirits & kindness. Offered last night to clear away. She thinks it only fair, as weâ€™ve raised her. No trouble about people coming. After Xmas discontent will set in no doubt; when must write criticism; the light languishes; Nessa Vita Clive are all away, But I will steal a march on that depression. Moreover, arenâ€™t I proud at the moment. Ruth Draper admires me: I am to meet her on Friday at Elena Richmonds. What an incredible concatenation! So tonight I go to the Pit to see Ruth Draper. Lunch with Sibyl; dine with Ethel; & a new dress, made from one 100 years old. These are the little waves that life makes; which keep us tossing & going up & down on top of them.
