### Sunday 20 November

I will now snatch a moment from what Morgan calls â€˜lifeâ€™ to enter a hurried note. My notes have been few; life a cascade, a glissade, a torrent: all together. I think on the whole this is our happiest autumn. So much work; & success now; & life on easy terms: heaven knows what. My morning rushes, pell mell, from 10 to 1. I write so quick I canâ€™t get it typed before lunch. This I suppose is the main backbone of my autumnâ€”Orlando. Never do I feel this, except for a morning or two, writing criticism. Today I began the third chapter. Do I learn anything? Too much of a joke perhaps for that; yet I like these plain sentences; & the externality of it for a change. It is too thin of course; splashed over the canvas; but I shall cover the ground by Jan. 7th (I say) & then re-write.

Vita comes; Dottie comes; Clive incessant; Tom; Roger; we have our Bloomsbury evenings; for the first time I have been spending money, on a bed, on a coat (the coat, at the moment, I regret) & had a delicious sense of affluence the other day when at Long Barn I tipped Loune 5/- for a nights lodging. But the money psychology is odd; & that it doesnâ€™t give me enormous pleasure to spend. I doubt that I want anything enoâ€™; yet worry about spending wrongly; & must buy an evening dress which worries me too. I have refused Sibyl; accepted Ethel. Fame increases; I think. Young men write about me in their absurd random books. Domestic life, Nelly that is, good as gold.

This is a summary; for I have too many letters to write, & cant catch that cloud which was so heavy in my brain when I sat down.

I made Vita cry the other night; quietly, unself-consciously. â€œI hate being boredâ€ I said, of her Campbells & Valery Taylors; & this she thought meant I should be tired of her.
