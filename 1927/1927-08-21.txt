### Sunday 21 August

Some little scenes I meant to write down.

One was on the flats towards Ripe one blazing hot day. We stopped in a bye road about 3 in the afternoon, & heard hymn singing. It was very lonely & desolate. Here were people singing to themselves, in the hot afternoon. I looked & saw a middle class â€˜ladyâ€™ in skirt & coat & ribboned hat, by the cottage door. She was making the daughters of the agricultural labourers sing; it was about three oâ€™clock on a Tuesday perhaps. Later we passed the ladies house; it had a wooden griffin nailed above the doorâ€”presumably her crest.

What I like, or one of the things I like, about motoring is the sense it gives one of lighting accidentally, like a voyager who touches another planet with the tip of his toe, upon scenes which would have gone on, have always gone on, will go on, unrecorded, save for this chance glimpse. Then it seems to me I am allowed to see the heart of the world uncovered for a moment. It strikes me that the hymn singing in the flats went on precisely so in Cromwellâ€™s time.

That was our only hot day, I think. One day the rain splashed down so fast that it rose again in a fountain, up off the road in our faces.
