### Saturday 5 March

Both rather headachy & fatigued. This is the last slope up of the year which is always worst. Finishing, correcting the last proofs that is to say, of a book is always a screw. Then I have written rather incessantly, one thing after another. A holiday, without dinner to order, or telephone to answer, or people to talk to, will be a divine miracle. We go to Cassis on the 30th; then to Sicily; so home by Rome. What could be more to my heart. Often I sit & think of looking at things. The greed of my eye is insatiable. To think of seeing a new place fills me with excitement. I now make up pictures of Sicily. Think of the Campagna grey in the evening.

I have been hard pressed about the Eliot fund, & behind the scenes of ladies diplomacyâ€”Chrissie & Sibyl, that is: so much suavity, so much distrust of each other, & so great a desire for compliments. Molly came to tea; could not get her mind off her troubles, first laughing at themâ€”Desmond all right, & so on: then brushing laughter aside, & becoming more & more openly worried. Sibyl had cross examined her about her debts. To such indignities poverty exposes one. So I told her the truth, or what I hope will be the truth: that friends are subscribing enough to send them abroad, Oh how wonderful! she exclaimed, she never having seen Italy or Spain all these years. â€œIâ€™m afraid Desmond has had rather an unhappy life,â€ she said. â€œBut then think of Lytton â€¦ Of course I was extravagant about doing the house up â€¦ but then we can let it.â€ â€œRachel goes for long walks at night & reads Coleridgeâ€”Oh Desmondâ€™s hopelessâ€”heâ€™s like a dog who runs out if the door is open.â€ So we laid our heads together over the fire; & felt very sisterly & sympathetic. I distrust though the pleasure one gets in helping oneâ€™s friends.
