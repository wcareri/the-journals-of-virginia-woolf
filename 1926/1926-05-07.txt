### Friday 7 May

No change. â€œLondon calling the British Isles. Good morning everyoneâ€. That is how it begins at 10. The only news that the archbishops are conferring, & ask our prayers that they may be guided right. Whether this means action, we know not. We know nothing. Mrs Cartwright walked from Hampstead. She & L. got heated arguing, she being antilabour; because she does not see why they should be supported, & observes men in the street loafing instead of working. Very little work done by either of us today. A cold, wet day, with sunny moments. All arrangements unchanged. Girl came to make chair covers, having walked from Shoreditch, but enjoyed it. Times sent for 25 Violas. Question whether to bring out a skeleton Roneo Nation. Leonard went to the office, I to the Britâ ish Musâ eum; where all was chill serenity, dignity & severity. Written up are the names of great men; & we all cower like mice nibbling crumbs in our most official discreet impersonal mood beneath. I like this dusty bookish atmosphere. Most of the readers seemed to have rubbed their noses off & written their eyes out. Yet they have a life they likeâ€”believe in the necessity of making books, I suppose: verify, collate, make up other books, for ever. It must be 15 years since I read here. I came home & found L. & Hubert Henderson arriving from the officeâ€”Hubert did what is now called â€œtaking a cup of teaâ€, which means an hour & a halfs talk about the Strike. Here is his prediction: if it is not settled, or in process, on Monday, it will last 5 weeks. Today no wages are paid. Leonard said he minded this more than the war & Hubert told us how he had travelled in Germany, & what brutes they were in 1912. He thinks gas & electricity will go next; had been at a journalists meeting where all were against labour (against the general strike that is) & assumed Government victory. L. says if the state wins & smashes Tâ rades. Uâ nions he will devote his life to labour: if the archbishop succeeds, he will be baptised. Now to dine at the Commercio to meet Clive.
