### Monday 2 August

Bank Holiday

Very fat woman, girl & man spend Bank Holidayâ€”a day of complete sun & satisfactionâ€”looking up family graves in the churchyard. 23 youngish men & women spend it tramping along with ugly black boxes on shoulders & arms, taking photographs. Man says to woman â€œSome of these quiet villages donâ€™t seem to know its bank holiday at allâ€ in a tone of superiority & slight contempt.

The Married Relation

Arnold Bennett says that the horror of marriage lies in its â€˜dailinessâ€™. All acuteness of relationship is rubbed away by this. The truth is more like this. Lifeâ€”say 4 days out of 7â€”becomes automatic; but on the 5th day a bead of sensation (between husband & wife) forms, wh. is all the fuller & more sensitive because of the automatic customary unconscious days on either side. That is to say the year is marked by moments of great intensity. Hardyâ€™s â€˜moments of visionâ€™. How can a relationship endure for any length of time except under these conditions?
