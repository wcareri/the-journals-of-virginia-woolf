### Wednesday 3 March

And I did have a bit of a headacheâ€”yes; all this time is rather weathering headaches. Nailing a flag to a mast in a gale, I have just compared writing a novel in London to that, in a letter to Vita. The glow is off my visit to Herbert & Freda at Cookham: a very memorable day. From their windows you look down on the top of old Mr Watkinsâ€™ bald head skulling on the Thames. You look at two twisted stakes in the river which I took for cranes; & across Marlow to some hills. They motored us up into the hills, & it was oddly strangely still & bright & empty & full of unblown flowers. We saw a Queen Anne house calledâ€”I forget; so high & remote, with turf to its door; & broad alleys; capacious windows, a woman. Well; no one gets more pleasure from these sights than I do; only the wave of pleasure leaves some regretâ€”all this beauty goingâ€”goingâ€”going: & I in Tavistock Sqre not seeing it. And spiritually it was very interesting. I thought I had found the real human beingâ€”something so simple & fitted to its surroundings as to be almost irreflective, in Freda. She is nearer humanity than I am: eats her way into the heart of it, as I cannot. Her thighs are thick with honey. But the impression is dying, as they do, under othersâ€”how I lost my little mother of pearl brooch, bought a 16/ hat which I do not like, & must go to tea at Ethelâ€™s tomorrow in what then? My own lack of beauty depresses me today. But how far does the old convention about â€˜beautyâ€™ bear looking into? I think of the people I have known. Are they beautiful? This problem I leave unsolved.

Raymond gave a fancy dress party on Sunday night. I was torpid with a sleeping draught; & was dozing off, as the carriages arrived at no. 6. Still I envied them; & thought, when Raymond telephoned about the copy of Old Kensington which I gave him & said how lovely Nancy had looked, that I had missed the greatest sight of the season. Happily, Lucas comes to tea, & he says he hears it was a terrible sticky dull party, with not room to turn round in, which greatly pleases me. Lucas, Peter, I should call him, came, from friendship; which friendship, as I suppose, was gently stimulated by my praise of his novel. He is a bony rosy little austere priest; so whole, & sane, & simple throughout one canâ€™t help respecting him, though when it comes to books we disagree. He says Tom &c: have thrown intellect to the winds; given up the ghost; he says Houseman & de la Mare are the real poets. I say poetry is defunct; & Tom &c anyhow try to animate it. The Sitwells, he says, advertise. Theyâ€™re aristocrats, I say, thinking criticism upstart impertinence on the part of flunkeys. No merit in their works anyhow, he says. But what about this drawing room singer, de la Mare, I ask. The most charming of men. Granted. Granted, on Peterâ€™s side, that he has no coherency whateverâ€”is always darting after strange monstersâ€”goldfish in bowls, I say. Well, but we cant all be great philosophical poets, he says. Anyhow Tom ainâ€™t a drawing room singer, I say. Tom has been down lecturing, & not creating a good impression at Cambridge, I fancy. He tells the young men, in private, how they cook fish in Paris: his damned selfconsciousness again, I suppose. But Peter is, to my mind, too entire in his judgments; founded on book learning & prettiness into the bargain. He has no ascendency of brain: he is not, & now never will be, a personage: which is the one thing needful in criticism, or writing of any sort, I think; for weâ€™re all as wrong as wrong can be. But character is the thing.
