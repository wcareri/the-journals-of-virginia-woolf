Quarrel with L. settled in studio. Oh, but how incessant the arguments & interruptions are! As I write, L. is telephoning to Hubert. We are getting up a petition. There was a distinct thaw (we thought) last night. The Arch B. & Grey both conciliatory. So we went to bed happy. Today ostensibly the same dead lock; beneath the surface all sorts of currents, of which we get the most contradictory reports. Dear old Frankie has a story (over the fire in the bookshop) of an interview between Asquith & Reading which turned Reading hostile to the men. Later, through Clive, through Desmond, Asquith is proved to be at the Wharfe, 60 miles from Lord Reading. Lady Wimbore gave a partyâ€”brought Thomas & Baldwin together. Meeting mysteriously called off today. Otherwise strike wd. have been settled. I to H of Commons this morning with L.â€™s article to serve as stuffing for Hugh Dalton in the Commons this afternoon. All this humbug of police & marble statues vaguely displeasing. But the Gvt. provided me with buses both ways, & no stones thrown. Silver & crimson guard at Whitehall; the cenotaph, & men bare heading themselves. Home to find Tom Marshall caballing with L.; after lunch to Birrell & Garnettâ€™s bookshop, where the gossip (too secret for the telephone) was imparted; to London Library where Goochâ€”a tall, pale mule, affable & long winded, was seen, & Molly dustily diligently reading the Dublin Review for 1840, walk home; Clive, to refute gossip; James to get St Loe to sign; then Maynard ringing up to command us to print the Nation as the N. Statesman is printed; to wh. I agreed, & L. disagreed; then dinner; a motor car collisionâ€”more telephones ringing at the moment 9.5.
