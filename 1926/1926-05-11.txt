### Tuesday 11 May

I may as well continue to writeâ€”this book is used to scandalous mistreatmentâ€”while I waitâ€”here interruptions began which lasted till the present moment/ when I write from 12.30 to 3 with Gerald Brenan in the study composing with infinite difficulty a letter to Mr Galsworthy. Arguing about the Arâ chbishop of Canterbury with Jack Squire at 12 seems now normal, but notâ€”how often do I repeatâ€”nearly as exciting as writing To the Lighthouse or about de Qâ uincey. I believe it is false psychology to think that in after years these details willl be interesting. The war is now barren sand after all. But one never knows: & waiting about, writing serves to liberate the mind from the fret & itch of these innumerable details. Squire doesnâ€™t want to â€œknuckle underâ€. To kneel is the duty of the Church. The Church has no connection with the nation. Events are that the Roneo workers refuse to set up L.â€™s article in the Nation, in which he says that the Strike is not illegal or unconstitutional. Presumably this is a little clutch of the Government throttle. Mr Baldwin has been visiting the Zoo. In the middle of lunch admirable Miss Bulley arrives, having visited Conway unsuccessfully. St Loe has joined. So Rose Macaulay & Lytton. Tonight the names are to be handed in; & then perhaps silence will descend upon us. Ralph & Gerald are our emissaries. But then everyone rings upâ€”the most unlikely peopleâ€”Donald Brace for instance, Kahan; the woman comes with the new sofa cover. Yesterday Ralph & Frances Marshall were in a railway accident. She had her teeth jangled. One man was killed; another had his leg brokenâ€”the result of driving a train without signals, by the efforts of ardent optimistic undergraduates. Billing has been in to say he will print anything, all his men being back & needing work. So, as poor MacDermott has been dead since January, perhaps the Nation will be done by them. Come to think of it, almost all our type is standing, so our printing was in any case hardly feasible. Must I now ring up James? Dayâ€™s Library boy was set upon by roughs, had his cycle overturned, but kept his books & was unhurt after calling here for 6 Tree. Tree dribbles along. There is an occasional order. Mrs Câ artwright. arrives on Faithâ€™s bicycle which is red with rust.
