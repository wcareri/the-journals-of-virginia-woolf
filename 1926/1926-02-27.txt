### Saturday 27 February

I think I shall initiate a new convention for this bookâ€”beginning each day on a new pageâ€”my habit in writing serious literature. Certainly, I have room to waste a little paper in this yearâ€™s book. As for the soul: why did I say I would leave it out? I forget. And the truth is, one canâ€™t write directly about the soul. Looked at, it vanishes: but look at the ceiling, at Grizzle, at the cheaper beasts in the Zoo which are exposed to walkers in Regents Park, & the soul slips in. It slipped in this afternoon. I will write that I said, staring at the bison: answering L. absentmindedly; but what was I going to write?

Mrs Webbâ€™s book has made me think a little what I could say of my own life. I read some of 1923 this morning, being headachy again, & taking a delicious draught of silence. But then there were causes in her life: prayer; principle. None in mine. Great excitability & search after something. Great contentâ€”almost always enjoying what Iâ€™m at, but with constant change of mood. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m ever bored. Sometimes a little stale; but I have a power of recoveryâ€”which I have tested; & am now testing for the 50th time. I have to husband my head still very carefully: but then, as I said to Leonard today, I enjoy epicurean ways of society; sipping & then shutting my eyes to taste. I enjoy almost everything. Yet I have some restless searcher in me. Why is there not a discovery in life? Something one can lay hands on & say â€œThis is it?â€ My depression is a harassed feelingâ€”Iâ€™m looking; but thatâ€™s not itâ€”thats not it. What is it? And shall I die before I find it? Then (as I was walking through Russell Sqre last night) I see the mountains in the sky: the great clouds; & the moon which is risen over Persia; I have a great & astonishing sense of something there, which is â€˜itâ€™â€”It is not exactly beauty that I mean. It is that the thing is in itself enough: satisfactory; achieved. A sense of my own strangeness, walking on the earth is there too: of the infinite oddity of the human position; trotting along Russell Sqre with the moon up there, & those mountain clouds. Who am I, what am I, & so on: these questions are always floating about in me; & then I bump against some exact factâ€”a letter, a person, & come to them again with a great sense of freshness. And so it goes on. But, on this showing which is true, I think, I do fairly frequently come upon this â€˜itâ€™; & then feel quite at rest.

Is that what I meant to say? Not in the least. I was thinking about my own character; not about the universe. Oh & about society again; dining with Lord Berners at Cliveâ€™s made me think that. How, at a certain moment, I see through what Iâ€™m saying; detest myself; & wish for the other side of the moon; reading alone, that is. How many phases one goes through between the soup & the sweet! I want, partly as a writer, to found my impressions on something firmer. I said to

Lord B. All you must do in writing is to float off the contents of your mind. Clive & Raymond laughed & said Thats exactly what you do anyhow. And I donâ€™t want that to be all. Nor is it. Theres a good deal of shaping & composing in my books. Howeverâ€”the main idea of them is that, then; & I dont like it. Lord B. was stockish, resolute, quick witted: analysed his own instability. His father was a sea captain; wished him not on any account to be a long haired artist; his mother used to say â€œMy little boy plays so nicelyâ€”you should hear him playâ€ but she minded his not hunting & riding. So, he said, he was inhibited as a musician. His talent clung (I think he said) like a creeper to the edge of a cliff. One day he wrote two marches for fun. Stravinsky saw them, thought them good, & they were published. So he was accepted as a serious musician, with only 4 lessons from Tovey in counterpoint. He had an astonishing facility. He could write things that sounded all right. Suddenly, last year, all his pleasure in it went. He met a painter, asked him how you paint; bought â€˜hogsheadsâ€™â€”(meant hogâ€™s bristles) & canvas & copied an Italian picture, brilliantly, consummately, says Clive. Has the same facility there: but it will come to nothing he said, like the other.

What did we talk about? Tom & the Sitwells; Eddie Marsh & Lady Colefax, & I felt one cd. go on saying these things for ever, & they mean nothing. Sure enough, he asked me to dine: & now I say I have a headache & canâ€™t.
