### Thursday 30 September

I wished to add some remarks to this, on the mystical side of this solitude; how it is not oneself but something in the universe that oneâ€™s left with. It is this that is frightening & exciting in the midst of my profound gloom, depression, boredom, whatever it is: One sees a fin passing far out. What image can I reach to convey what I mean? Really there is none I think. The interesting thing is that in all my feeling & thinking I have never come up against this before. Life is, soberly & accurately, the oddest affair; has in it the essence of reality. I used to feel this as a childâ€”couldnâ€™t step across a puddle once I remember, for thinking, how strangeâ€”what am I? &c. But by writing I dont reach anything. All I mean to make is a note of a curious state of mind. I hazard the guess that it may be the impulse behind another book. At present my mind is totally blank & virgin of books* I want to watch & see how the idea at first occurs. I want to trace my own process. I was depressed again today because Vita did not come (yet relieved at the same time); had to hold L.â€™s ladder in the garden, when I wanted to write or to try on Nessaâ€™s dress; & slightly afraid that this dress is not very successful. But I am shelving the dress problem on these principles. I am having cheap day clothes; & a good dress from Brooke; & I am being less pernickety about keeping to limits, as I have only to write & stir myself, to make, I wager, quite Â£50 extra in the year for my own extravagances. No longer shall I let a coat for Â£3 floor me in the middle of the night, or be afraid to lunch out because â€œIâ€™ve no clothes.â€ A broader & bolder grasp is what is wanted. Here I am going into the question of order & so on, like a housekeeper, taking in supplies. Soon, this time next week, I shall have no time for glooming or introspection. It will be â€œWhen may I come & see you?â€ Already Betty Potter has begun.

Now I must scheme a little at my book of criticism.
