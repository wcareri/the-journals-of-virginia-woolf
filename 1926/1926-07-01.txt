These reflections about the hat read rather amusingly I think. What a weathercock of sensibility I am! How I enjoyâ€”or at least how (for I was acutely unhappy & humiliated) these gyrations interest me, conscious as I am of a strong lynch pin controlling themâ€”Leonard in short. Coming out from lunching with Maynard today I ran (in the hat, in the dress) into Clive & Mary, & had to stand their fire: dress praised to the skies, hat passed. So thats over. Indeed the cloud began to lift at 7 last night.

But all this has obscured Garsington; Bridges; & Wells. These great men are so much like the rest of us. Wells remarkable only for a combination of stockishness with acuity: he has a sharp nose, & the cheeks & jowl of a butcher. He likes, I judge, rambling & romancing about the lives of other people; he romanced about the Webbs: said their books were splendid eggs, well & truly laid, but addled. Described Beatrice, as by a gipsy & a Jew: a flashing creature, become Quaker as we all do as we get on. That has nothing to do with (God) Christianity. Are you a Quaker, I asked. Of course I am. One believes that there is a reason for things (I think he said). But he did not rise steadily off the ground for long. Lunch is a hot stodgy hour too. I could see from the plaintive watery look on Mrs Wellsâ€™ face (she has widely spaced teeth & in repose looks very worried, at the same time vacant) that he is arrogant lustful & bullying in private life. The virtues he likes are courage & vitality. I said how ghastly! (That is the story of Dorothy Richardsonâ€™s struggles.) No: nothing is ghastly where there is courage he said. He rambled over her life, amusingly. How she married Odel, a man who makes symbolical drawingsâ€”bubbles coming out of a human mouth & turning into womens legs & so on: which is so like life, Wells said: the heterogeneityâ€”one thing leading to another, & the design so remarkable. But they dont sell. And now Duckworth wonâ€™t publish any more of her books.

As for Bridges: he sprang from a rhododendron bush, a very lean tall old man, with a curly grey hat, & a reddish ravaged face, smoky fierce eyes, with a hazy look in them; very active; rather hoarse, talking incessantly. We sat in his open room & looked past blue spikes of flowers to hills, which were invisible, but when they show, all this goes out he saidâ€”his one poetical saying, or saying that struck me as such. We talked about handwriting, & criticism; how Garrod had written on Keats; & they know a Petrarchan sonnet, but not why one alters it. Because they dont write sonnets, I suggested, & urged him to write criticism. He is direct & spry, very quick in all his movements, racing me down the garden to look at pinks, then into his library, where he showed me the French critics, then said Michelet was his favourite historian; then I asked to see the Hopkins manuscripts; & sat looking at them with that gigantic grasshopper Aldous folded up in a chair close by. Ottoline undulated & vagulated.

He asked me to come again: would read me his poemsâ€”not his early ones which want a beautiful voice, & arenâ€™t interesting he said: but his later ones, his hexameters. He skipped off & held the gate open. I said how much I liked his poemsâ€”true of the short ones: but was mainly pleased & gratified to find him so obliging & easy & interested. Ottoline flattered me on this point. But she had her points too; her dwindling charm reveals them, as we sat by the lake, discussing Mary Clive life, truth, literature. Then dressed, & Aldous & Eddie & Philip Nichols, & Miss Spender Clay, who can have Â£100 a year if she wants it Julian said.
