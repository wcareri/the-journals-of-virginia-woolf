### Sunday 9 May

There is no news of the strike. The broadcaster has just said that we are praying today. And L. & I quarrelled last night. I dislike the tub thumper in him; he the irrational Xtian in me. I will write it all out laterâ€”my feelings about the Strike; but I am now writing to test my theory that there is consolation in expression. Unthinkingly, I refused just now to lunch with the Phil Bakers, who fetched L. in their car. Suddenly, 10 minutes ago, I began to regret this profoundly. How I should love the talk, & seeing the house, & battling my wits against theirs. Now the sensible thing to do is to provide some pleasure to balance this, which I cd. not have had, if I had gone. I can only think of writing this, & going round the Square. Obscurely, I have my clothes complex to deal with. When I am asked out my first thought is, but I have no clothes to go in. Todd has never sent me the address of the shop; & I may have annoyed her by refusing to lunch with her. But the Virginia who refuses is a very instinctive & therefore powerful person. The reflective & sociable only comes to the surface later. Then the conflict.

Baldwin broadcast last night: he rolls his rs; tries to put more than mortal strength into his words. â€œHave faith in me. You elected me 18 months ago. What have I done to forfeit your confidence? Can you not trust me to see justice done between man & man?â€ Impressive as it is to hear the very voice of the Prime Minister, descendant of Pitt & Chatham, still I canâ€™t heat up my reverence to the right pitch. I picture the stalwart oppressed man, bearing the world on his shoulders. And suddenly his self assertiveness becomes a little ridiculous. He becomes megalomaniac. No I dont trust him: I donâ€™t trust any human being, however loud they bellow & roll their rs.
