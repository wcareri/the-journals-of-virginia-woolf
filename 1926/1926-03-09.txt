### Tuesday 9 March

Then I was at two parties: Ethelâ€™s tea; Maryâ€™s dinner.

Ethelâ€™s was a ghastly frizzly frying pan affair. I chattering in front of the footlights.

Well, said Ott. how are you? You look wonderfully well; as if you had never had an illness in your life.

(Now what does she say that for? To get pity for herself, sure enough.)

I canâ€™t say Iâ€™m any better.

But she is all dressed like a girl of 18; tomato coloured Georgette & fur.

Ethel says, tittering What a nice hat. Iâ€™m all windblown in my old felt, come through the snow, with Dadie.

Well, I say to myself, Iâ€™ll see this through anyhow, take my seat as on a throne, & proceed, first to little smug Leigh Ashton: Read wrote that Times Leader this morning (quoting me & Joyce as examples of good prose versus death of Queen Victoria).

I should so much like to know if you think its well writtenâ€”such a charming man.

Then diversion: Ethel; Ottoline: Percy Lubbock.

Are the Russians more passionate than we are?

No; I say; I have all the passions. Asked to define a dramatic scene; how Leonard says â€œI think the worse of you for everâ€ when I accept Ottâ€™s invitation. Suddenly I remember it was Ottâ€™s invitation. If Mr Lubbock had a daughter he would have scenesâ€”this is sheer egotistical cruelty on Ottâ€™s part; so home, holding Dadie by the arm; talking about his fellowship, to be announced on Saturday, (But Peter thinks he wonâ€™t get it) & abusing Chelsea, & Ottoline; & saying how unpopular I made myself.

As for Maryâ€™s party, there, save for the usual shyness about powder & paint, shoes & stockings, I was happy, owing to the supremacy of literature. This keeps us sweet & sane, George Moore & me I mean.

He has a pink foolish face; blue eyes like hard marbles; a crest of snowhite hair; little unmuscular hands; sloping shoulders; a high stomach; neat, purplish well brushed clothes; & perfect manners, as I consider them. That is to say he speaks without fear or dominance; accepting me on my merits; every one on their merits. Still in spite of age uncowed, unbeaten, lively, shrewd. As for Hardy & Henry James though, what shall one say?

â€œI am a fairly modest man; but I admit I think Esther Waters a better book than Tess.â€

But what is there to be said for that man? He cannot write. He cannot tell a story. The whole art of fiction consists in telling a story. Now he makes a woman confess. How does he do it? In the third personâ€”a scene that should be moving, impressive. Think how Tolstoi would have done it!

But, said Jack War & Peace is the greatest novel in the world. I remember the scene where Natasha puts on a moustache, & Rostov sees her for the first time as she is & falls in love with her.

No, my good friend, there is nothing very wonderful in that. That is an ordinary piece of observation. But my good friend (to meâ€”half hesitating to call me this) what have you to say for Hardy? You cannot find anything to say. English fiction is the worst part of English literature. Compare it with the Frenchâ€”with the Russians. Henry James wrote some pretty little stories before he invented his jargon. But they were about rich people. You cannot write stories about rich people; because, I think he said, they have no instincts. But Henry James was enamoured of marble balustrades. There was no passion in any of his people. And Anne BrontÃ« was the greatest of the BrontÃ«s & Conrad could not write, & so on. But this is out of date.
