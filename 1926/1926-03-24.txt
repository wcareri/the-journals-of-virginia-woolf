### Wednesday 24 March

â€œIâ€™m going to hand in my resignation this morningâ€ said L. making the coffee.

To what? I asked.

â€œThe Nationâ€.

And it is done; & we have six months only before us. I feel 10 years younger; the shafts off our shoulders again & the world before us. I canâ€™t pretend to make much of a to-do about this either way. It was a temporary makeshift job, amusing at first, then galling, & last night, after an argument of the usual kind about literary articles & space & so on with Maynard & Hubert L. came to the decision to resign now. There was no quarrel. Oddly enough, having tea with Nessa, she had set me thinking the same thing. Phil Baker had said to her he thought L. the best living writer, & what a pity it was he spent so much time on the Nation & the Press. So there was I beginning, donâ€™t you think we might give them up!â€”when L. came in with his contribution to the question. He was dining with Clive, so the discussion waited till this morning; was decided by 10; in the hands of the Chief by 11â€”& now thank God no more chiefs for either of us so long as we live I hope.

The situation appears to be that L. shall make Â£300; I Â£200â€”& really I donâ€™t suppose we shall find it hard; & then the mercy of having no ties, no proofs, no articles to procure, & all that, is worth a little more exertion elsewhere, should it come to that. Iâ€™m amused at my own sense of liberation. To upset everything every 3 or 4 years is my notion of a happy life. Always to be tacking to get into the eye of the wind. Now a prudent life is, as L. pointed out in the Square the opposite of this. One ought to stick in the same place. But with Â£400 assured & no children, why imitate a limpet in order to enjoy a limpets safety? The next question will be, I see, the Press. Shall we give that up too, & so be quit of everything? Its not such an easy question, or so pressing. I sometimes wish it. For, speaking selfishly, it has served my turn: given me a chance of writing off my own bat, & now I doubt if Heinemann or Cape would much intimidate me. But then thereâ€™s the funâ€”which is considerable. The time will come, at this rate, when we have nothing in the world to resign: then, to get the effect of change, one will have to accept. We say we will travel & see the world. Anyhow I make my usual predictionâ€”we shall be richer this time next year without the Nation than with it.

I rather like feeling that I have to earn money. I intensely dislike being in office, in any post of authority. I dislike being in peopleâ€™s pay. This of course is part of the reason why I like writing for the Press. But I suppose freedom becomes a fetish like any other. These disjointed reflections I scribble on a divine, if gusty, day; being about, after reading Anna Karenina, to dine at a pot-house with Rose Macaulayâ€”not a cheerful entertainment; but an experience perhaps.

Lydia came into the room when L. was talking to Maynard this morning to show him her Zebra shoes, which cost Â£5.8.6. & they were really lizard, L. says. Also it is curious how a change like this destroys formalityâ â€”dissipates the elements.
