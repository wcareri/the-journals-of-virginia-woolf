Strike settled, (ring at bell)

The Strike was settled about 1.15â€”or it was then broadcast. I was in Tottenham Court Rd. at 1 & heard Bartholomew & Fletcherâ€™s megaphone declaim that the T.U.C. leaders were at Downing Street; came home to find that neither L. or Nelly had heard this: 5 minutes later, the wireless. They told us to stand by & await important news. Then a piano played a tune. Then the solemn broadcaster assuming incredible pomp & gloom & speaking one word to the minute read out: Message from 10 Downing Street. The T.U.C. leaders have agreed that Strike shall be withdrawn. Instantly L. dashed off to telephone to the office, Nelly to tell Pritchardâ€™s clerk, & I to Mrs C. (But Nâ elly. was beforehand) then we finished lunch; then I rang up Cliveâ€”who proposes that we should have a drink tonight. I saw this morning 5 or 6 armoured cars slowly going along Oxford Street; on each two soldiers sat in tin helmets, & one stood with his hand at the gun which was pointed straight ahead ready to fire. But I also noticed on one a policeman smoking a cigarette. Such sights I dare say I shall never see again; & dont in the least wish to. Already (it is now 10 past 2) men have appeared at the hotel with drainpipes. Also Grizzle has won her case against the Square.
