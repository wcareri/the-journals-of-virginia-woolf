### Sunday 5 September

So it will be done, written over that is, in 3 weeks, I forecast, from today. What emerges? At this moment Iâ€™m casting about for an end. The problem is how to bring Lily & Mr Râ amsay. together & make a combination of interest at the end. I am feathering about with various ideas. The last chapter which I begin tomorrow is In the Boat: I had meant to end with R. climbing on to the rock. If so, what becomes of Lily & her picture? Should there be a final page about her & Carmichael looking at the picture & summing up R.â€™s character? In that case I lose the intensity of the moment. If this intervenes, between R. & the lighthouse, thereâ€™s too much chop & change, I think. Could I do it in a parenthesis? so that one had the sense of reading the two things at the same time?

I shall solve it somehow, I suppose. Then I must go in to the question of quality. I think it may run too fast & free, & so be rather thin. On the other hand, I think it is subtler & more human than Jâ acobâ€™s Room & Mrs Dâ alloway. And I am encouraged by my own abundance as I write. It is proved, I think, that what I have to say is to be said in this manner. As usual, side stories are sprouting in great variety as I wind this up: a book of characters; the whole string being pulled out from some simple sentence, like Clara Paterâ€™s, â€œDonâ€™t you find that Barkerâ€™s pins have no points to them?â€ I think I can spin out all their entrails this way; but it is hopelessly undramatic. It is all in oratio obliqua. Not quite all; for I have a few direct sentences. The lyric portions of To the L. are collected in the 10 year lapse, & dont interfere with the text so much as usual. I feel as if it fetched its circle pretty completely this time: & I dont feel sure what the stock criticism will be. Sentimental? Victorian?

Then I must begin to plan out my book on literature for the Press. Six chapters. Why not groups of ideas, under some single headingâ€”for example. Symbolism. God. Nature. Plot. Dialogue. Take a novel & see what the component parts are. Separate this, & bring under them instances of all the books which display them biggest. Probably this would pan out historically. One could spin a theory which wd bring the chapters together. I donâ€™t feel that I can read seriouslyâ [?] & exactly for it. Rather I want to sort out all the ideas that have accumulated in me.

Then I want to write a bunch of â€˜Outlinesâ€™ to make money (for under a new arrangement, weâ€™re to share any money over Â£200 that I make): this I must leave rather to chance, according to what books come my way. I am frightfully contented these last few days, by the way. I dont quite understand it. Perhaps reason has something to do with it. Charleston & Tilton knocked me off my perch for a moment: Nessa & her children: Maynard & his carpets. My own gifts & shares seemed so moderate in comparison; my own fault tooâ€”a little more self control on my part, & we might have had a boy of 12, a girl of 10: This always rakes me wretched in the early hours. So I said, I am spoiling what I have. And thereupon settled to exploit my own possessions to the full; I can make money & buy carpets; I can increase the pleasure of life enormously by living it carefully. No doubt, this is a rationalisation of a state which is not really of that nature. Probably I am very lucky. Mrs Allinson says she would like to look like me. Mary says Iâ€™m the only woman she loves. Nelly cooks admirably. Then, I am extremely happy walking on the downs. I dont want to be talking to Eddy at Charleston. I like to have space to spread my mind out in. Whatever I think, I can rap out, suddenly to L. We are somehow very detached, free, harmonious. I donâ€™t in the least want to hurry up & finish the time here. I want to go to Seaford & walk back over the downs; to go & see the house at East Chiltington; to breathe in more light & air; to see more grey hollows & gold cornfields & the first ploughed land shining white, with the gulls flickering. No: I dont want anyone to come here & interrupt. I am immensely busy. Hence I come to my moral, which is simply to enjoy what one does enjoy, without teasing oneself oh but Nessa has children, Maynard carpets. I might go & stay with Ethel. For my own wishes are always definite enough to give me a lead, one way or another; & the chief joy in life is to follow these lights; I am now almost entirely surrounded by sheep. God knows, I wish we could buy the terrace, & have a garden all round the lodgeâ€”but this is not a serious diminution of joy.

Clive & Mary came over yesterday in brilliant sun. We sat on the millstones, (one sheep has a tail like a bell-ropeâ€”the others are all bit short.) Wells. Hardy. Maynard. Richardson. Christabelâ€”going to Greece for a month with Lesley Jowitt. Maupassantâ€™s metaphorsâ€”The Questionnaire. Lyttonâ€™s haremâ€”Their dulnessâ€”Carrington a cook who doesnâ€™t go out on Sundays. Whether Eddy is clever or not. Tonks & Steer & Mooreâ€”Tonks in love with Mary, Clive insists; she is modest. So we talked. Then I drove with them to the Laye, walked up the down behind Asheham & let all that wind & sun blow through the crazy sails of my old windmill, which gives me so much pleasure still. I forget what I thought about: did not think, I suppose; was all in a thrill of emotion at my being liked by Mary & being a success, &c. Home to music, my new 15/- table, talk with L.: a sense of great happiness & ease. Went & looked at the stars, but could not get quite the right sense of amazement (I can get this really well at times) because L. said

â€œNow come in. Its too cold to be outâ€
