The blessed thing is coming to an end I say to myself with a groan. Its like some prolonged rather painful & yet exciting process of nature, which one desires inexpressibly to have over. Oh the relief of waking & thinking its doneâ€”the relief, & the disappointment, I suppose. I am talking of To the Lighthouse. I am exacerbated by the fact that I spent 4 days last week hammering out de Quincey, which has been lying about since June; so refused Â£30 to write on Willa Cather; & now shall be quit in a week I hope of this unprofitable fiction, & could have wedged in Willa before going back. So I should have had Â£70 of my years 200 ready made by October: (my greed is immense: I want to have Â£50 of my own in the Bank to buy Persian carpets, pots, chairs &c.) Curse Richmond, Curse The Times, Curse my own procrastinations & nerves. I shall do Cobden Sanderson & Mrs Hemans & make something by them however. As for the bookâ€”Morgan said he felt â€˜This is a failureâ€™ as he finished The passage to India. I feelâ€”what? A little stale this last week or two from steady writing. But also a little triumphant. If my feeling is correct, this is the greatest stretch Iâ€™ve put my method to, & I think it holds. By this I mean that I have been dredging up more feelings & character, I imagine. But Lord knows, until I look at my haul. This is only my own feeling in process. Odd how Iâ€™m haunted by that damned criticism of Janet Caseâ€™s â€œits all dressing â€¦ technique. (Mrs Dalloway). The C.R. has substanceâ€. But then in ones strained state any fly has liberty to settle, & its always the gadflies. Muir praising me intelligently has comparatively little power to encourageâ€”when Iâ€™m working that isâ€”when the ideas halt. And this last lap, in the boat, is hard, because the material is not so rich as it is with Lily on the lawn: I am forced to be more direct & more intense. I am making some use of symbolism, I observe; & I go in dread of â€˜sentimentalityâ€™. Is the whole theme open to that charge? But I doubt that any theme is in itself good or bad. It gives a chance to ones peculiar qualitiesâ€”thats all. Then Iâ€™m concerned whether to stay with Ethel Sands or not: whether to buy a dress or not. Then Iâ€™m astonishingly happy in the countryâ€”a state of mind which, if I did not dislike hyphens, I should hyphen, to show that it is a state by itself.

We took Angus over the downs towards Falmer yesterday. After all these years, we have discovered some of the loveliest, loneliest, most surprising downland in these parts: lovelier I think than our rival the Seaford-Tilton down over which we walked in broiling sun last Thursday. How it beat on our heads, made poor puppy pant. Lydia & Maynard came to tea.
