### Sunday 11 April

Cannot read Mrs Webb because at any moment S. Tomlin may ring the bell. Also I wanted to go on about the Leafs. I have almost forgotten the impression they made on me. I have wrapped myself round in my own personality again. How does it come aboutâ€”these sudden intense changes of view? Perhaps my life, writing imagining, is unusually conscious: very vivid to me: & then, going to tea with the Leafs destroys it more completely than other peopleâ€™s lives because my life is saying to itself â€œThis is lifeâ€”the only lifeâ€. But when I enter a complete world of its own; where Walter cracks a joke, I realise that this is existing whether I exist or not; & so get bowled over. Violent as they are, these impressions go quickly; leaving a sediment of ideas which I shall discuss with L. perhaps when we go to Iwerne Minster. About natural happiness: how it is destroyed by our way of life.

Mrs Webbâ€™s Life makes me compare it with mine. The difference is that she is trying to relate all her experiences to history. She is very rational & coherent. She has always thought about her life & the meaning of the world: indeed, she begins this at the age of 4. She has studied herself as a phenomenon. Thus her autobiography is part of the history of the 19th Century. She is the product of science, & the lack of faith in God; she was secreted by the Time Spirit. Anyhow she believes this to be so; & makes herself fit in very persuasively & to my mind very interestingly. She taps a great stream of thought. Unlike that self-conscious poseur Walter Raleigh she is much more interested in facts & truth than in what will shock people & what a professor ought not to say. Tomlin does not seem to be coming, & L. is at Staines, so I will try a little reading.
