### Thursday 20 May

Waiting for L. to come back from chess with Roger: 11.25. I think nothing need be said of the Strike. As tends to happen, oneâ€™s mind slips after the crisis, & what the settlement is, or will be, I know not.

We must now fan the books up again. Viola & Phil Baker were both struck on the wing. Viola comes, very tactfully, as a friend, she says, to consult after dinner. She is a flamboyant creatureâ€”much of an actressâ€”much abused by the Waleys & Marjories; but rather taking to me. She has the great egotism, the magnification of self, which any bodily display, I think, produces. She values women by their hips & ankles, like horses. Easily reverts to the topic of her own charms: how she shd. have married the D. of Rutland. â€œLord â€”â€” (his uncle) told me I was the woman John really loved. The duchess said to me â€˜Do make love to John & get him away from â€”â€”. At any rate youâ€™re tall & beautifulâ€”â€™ And I sometimes think if Iâ€™d married himâ€”but he never asked meâ€”Daddy wouldnâ€™t have died. Iâ€™d have prevented that operation: Then how heâ€™d have loved a duke for a son in law! All his life was dressing upâ€”that sort of thing you know.â€ So she runs on, in the best of clothes, easy & familiar, but reserved too; with the wiles & warinesses of a woman of the world, half sordid half splendid, not quite at her ease with us, yet glad of a room where she can tell her stories, of listeners to whom she is new & strange. She will run on by the hourâ€”yet is very watchful not to bore; a good business woman, & floating over considerable acuteness on her charm. All this however, is not making her book move, as they say.

Eddy came in to tea. I like himâ€”his flattery? his nobility? I dont knowâ€”I find him easy & eager. And Vita comes to lunch tomorrow, which will be a great amusement & pleasure. I am amused at my relations with her: left so ardent in Januaryâ€”& now what? Also I like her presence & her beauty. Am I in love with her? But what is love? Her being â€˜in loveâ€™ (it must be commaâ€™d thus) with me, excites & flatters; & interests. What is this â€˜loveâ€™? Oh & then she gratifies my eternal curiosity: whoâ€™s she seen, whats she doneâ€”for I have no enormous opinion of her poetry. How could Iâ€”I who have such delight in mitigating the works even of my greatest friends. I should have been reading her poem tonight: instead finished Sharon Turnerâ€”a prosy, simple, old man; the very spit & image of Saxon, a boundless bore, I daresay, with the most intense zeal for â€œimproving myselfâ€, & the holiest affections, & 13 children, & no character or impetusâ€”a love of long walks, of music; modest, yet conceited in an ant like way. I mean he has the industry & persistency in recounting compliments of an ant, but so little character that one hardly calls him vain!
