### Sunday 25 July

At first I thought it was Hardy, & it was the parlourmaid, a small thin girl, wearing a proper cap. She came in with silver cake stands & so on. Mrs Hardy talked to us about her dog. How long ought we to stay? Can Mr Hardy walk much &c I asked, making conversation, as I knew one would have to. She has the large sad lack lustre eyes of a childless woman; great docility & readiness, as if she had learnt her part; not great alacrity, but resignation, in welcoming more visitors; wears a sprigged voile dress, black shoes, & a necklace. We cant go far now, she said, though we do walk every day, because our dog isnâ€™t able to walk far. He bites, she told us. She became more natural & animated about the dog, who is evidently the real centre of her thoughtsâ€”then the maid came in. Then again the door opened, more sprucely, & in trotted a little puffy cheeked cheerful old man, with an atmosphere cheerful & businesslike in addressing us, rather like an old doctors or solicitors, saying â€œWell nowâ€”â€ or words like that as he shook hands. He was dressed in rough grey with a striped tie. His nose has a joint in it, & the end curves down. A round whitish face, the eyes now faded & rather watery, but the whole aspect cheerful & vigorous. He sat on a three cornered chair (I am too jaded with all this coming & going to do more than gather facts) at a round table, where there were the cake stands & so on; a chocolate roll; what is called a good tea; but he only drank one cup, sitting on his three cornered chair. He was extremely affable & aware of his duties. He did not let the talk stop or disdain making talk. He talked of fatherâ€”said he had seen me, or it might have been my sister but he thought it was me, in my cradle. He had been to Hyde Park Placeâ€”oh Gate was it. A very quiet street. That was why my father liked it. Odd to think that in all these years he had never been down there again. He went there often. Your father took my novelâ€”Far From the Madding Crowd. We stood shoulder to shoulder against the British public about certain matters dealt with in that novelâ€”You may have heard. Then he said how some other novel had fallen through that was to appearâ€”the parcel had been lost coming from Franceâ€”not a very likely thing to happen, as your father saidâ€”a big parcel of manuscript; & he asked me to send my story. I think he broke all the Cornhill lawsâ€”not to see the whole book; so I sent it in chapter by chapter, & was never late. Wonderful what youth is! I had it in my head doubtless, but I never thought twice about itâ€”It came out every month. They were nervous, because of Miss Thackeray I think. She said she became paralysed & could not write a word directly she heard the press begin. I daresay it was bad for a novel to appear like that. One begins to think what is good for the magazine, not what is good for the novel.

You think what makes a strong curtain, put in Mrs Hardy jocularly. She was leaning upon the tea table, not eating gazing out.

Then we talked about manuscripts. Mrs Smith had found the MS of F. from the M.C. in a drawer during the war, & sold it for the Red Cross. Now he has his MSS back, & the printer rubs out all the marks. But he wishes they would leave them, as they prove it genuine.

He puts his head down like some old pouter pigeon. He has a very long head; & quizzical bright eyes, for in talk they grow bright. He said when he was in the Strand 6 years ago he scarcely knew where he was, & he used to know it all intimately. He told us that he used to buy 2nd hand booksâ€”nothing valuableâ€”in Wyck Street. Then he wondered why Great James Street should be so narrow & Bedford Row so broad. He had often wondered about that. At this rate, London would soon be unrecognisable. But I shall never go there again. Mrs Hardy tried to persuade him that it was an easy driveâ€”only 6 hours or so. I asked if she liked it, & she said Granville Barker had told her that when she was in the nursing home she had â€˜the time of her lifeâ€™. She knew everyone in Dorchester, but she thought there were more interesting people in London. Had I often been to Siegfriedâ€™s flat? I said no. Then she asked about him & Morgan, said he was elusive, as if they enjoyed visits from him. I said I heard from Wells that Mr Hardy had been up to London to see an air raid. â€œWhat things they say!â€ he said. It was my wife. There was an air raid one night when we stayed with Barrie. We just heard a little pop in the distanceâ€”The searchlights were beautiful. I thought if a bomb now were to fall on this flat how many writers would be lost. And he smiled in his queer way, which is fresh & yet sarcastic a little: anyhow shrewd. Indeed, there was no trace to my thinking of the simple peasant. He seemed perfectly aware of everything; in no doubt or hesitation; having made up his mind; & being delivered of all his work; so that he was in no doubt about that either. He was not interested much in his novels, or in anybodies novels; took it all easily & naturally. â€œI never took long with themâ€ he said. The longest was the Dinnasts. (so pronounced). â€œBut that was really 3 booksâ€ said Mrs Hardy. Yes: & that took me 6 years; but not working all the time. Can you write poetry regularly? I asked (being beset with the desire to hear him say something about his books); but the dog kept cropping up. How he bit; how the inspector came out; how he was ill; & they could do nothing for him. Would you mind if I let him in? asked Mrs Hardy, & in came Weâ sâ sex, a very tousled, rough brown & white mongrel, got to guard the house, so naturally he bites people, said Mrs H.; Well, I dont know about that, said Hardy, perfectly natural, & not setting much stock by his poems either it seemed. Did you write poems at the same time as your novels? I asked. No. he said. I wrote a great many poems. I used to send them about, but they were always returned, he chuckled. And in those days I believed in editors. Many were lostâ€”all the fair copies were lost. But I found the notes, & I wrote them from those. I was always finding them. I found one the other day; but I donâ€™t think I shall find any more.

Siegfried took rooms near here, & said he was going to work very hard, but he left soon.

E.Â M. Forster takes a long time to produce anythingâ€”7 years, he chuckled. All this made a great impression of the ease with which he did things. â€œI daresay F. from the M.Â C. would have been a great deal better if I had written it differentlyâ€, he said. But as if it could not be helped, & did not matter.

He used to go to the Lushingtons in Kensington Sqre & saw my mother there. She used to come in & out when I was talking to your father.

I wanted him to say one word about his writing before we left & cd only ask wh. of his books he wd. have chosen, if like me, he had had to choose one to read in the train. I had taken the Mâ ayor of Câ asterbridge. Thatâ€™s being dramatised, put in Mrs H. & then brought Lâ oveâ€™s Lâ ittle Ironies.

And did it hold your interest? he asked.

I stammered that I could not stop reading it, which was true, but sounded wrong. Anyhow, he was not going to be drawn, & went off about giving a young lady a wedding present. None of my books are fitted to be wedding presents, he said. You must give Mrs Woolf one of your books, said Mrs Hardy, inevitably. Yes I will. But Iâ€™m afraid only in the little thin paper edition, he said. I protested that it would be enough if he wrote his name (then was vaguely uncomfortable).

Then there was de la Mare. His last book of stories seemed to them such a pity. Hardy had liked some of his poems very much. People said he must be a sinister man to write such stories. But he is a very nice manâ€”a very nice man indeed.

He said to a friend who begged him not to give up poetry, â€œIâ€™m afraid poetry is giving up me.â€ The truth is he is a very kind man, & sees anyone who wants to see him. He has 16 people for the day sometimes.

Do you think one canâ€™t write poetry if one sees people? I asked. â€œOne might be able toâ€”I dont see why not. Its a question of physical strengthâ€ said Hardy. But clearly he preferred solitude himself. Always however he said something sensible & sincere; & thus made the obvious business of compliment giving rather unpleasant. He seemed to be free of it all; very active minded; liking to describe people; not to talk in an abstract way: for example Col. Lawrence, bicycling with a broken arm â€œheld like thatâ€ from Lincoln to Hardy listened at the door; to hear if there was anyone there.

I hope he wonâ€™t commit suicide, said Mrs Hardy pensively, still leaning over the tea cups, gazing despondently. He often says things like it, though he has never said quite that perhaps. But he has blue lines round his eyes. He calls himself Shaw in the army. No one is to know where he is. But it got into the papers.

He promised me (to give up flyâ€”) not to go into the air, said Hardy.

My husband doesnâ€™t like anything to do with the air, said Mrs Hardy. Now we began to look at the grandfather clock in the corner. We said we must goâ€”tried to confess we were only down for the day. I forgot to say that he offered L. whisky & water, wh. struck me that he was competent as a host, & in every way.

So we got up & signed Mrs Hâ€™s visitors books; & Hardy took my L. Little Ironies off, & trotted back with it signed, & Woolf spelt Wolff, wh. I daresay had given him some anxiety. Then Weâ ssex came in again. I asked if Hardy could stroke him. So he bent down & stroked him, like the master of the house. Weâ sâ sex went on wheezing away.

There was not a trace anywhere of deference to editors, or respect for rank, an extreme simplicity: What impressed me was his freedom, ease, & vitality. He seemed very â€œGreat Victorianâ€ doing the whole thing with a sweep of his hand (they are ordinary smallish, curled up hands) & setting no great stock by literature; but immensely interested in facts; incidents; & somehow, one could imagine, naturally swept off into imagining & creating without a thought of its being difficult or remarkable; becoming obsessed; & living in imagination. Mrs Hardy thrust his old grey hat into his hand & he trotted us out on to the road. Where is that? I asked him, pointing to a clump of trees on the down opposite, for his house is outside the town, with open country (rolling, massive downs, crowned with little tree coronets before & behind) & he said, with interest, â€œThat is Weymouth. We see the lights at nightâ€”not the lights themselves, but the reflection of them.â€ And so we left, & he trotted in again.

Also I asked him if I might see the picture of Tess which Morgan had described, an old picture: whereupon he led me to an awful engraving of Tess coming into a room from a picture by Herkomer, â€œThat was rather my idea of herâ€ he said. But I said I had been told he had an old picture. â€œThats fictionâ€ he said. â€œI used to see people now & then with a look of her.â€

â€”â€”â€”

Also Mrs Hardy said to me, do you know Aldous Huxley? I said I did. They had been reading his book, which she thought â€˜very cleverâ€™. But Hardy could not remember it. Said his wife had to read to himâ€”his eyes were now so bad. (â€œWas that the book where the) â€œTheyve changed everything now he said. We used to think there was a beginning & a middle & an end. We believed in the Aristotelian theory. Now one of those stories came to an end with a woman going out of the room.â€ He chuckled. But he no longer reads novels.

The whole thingâ€”literature, novels &câ€”all seemed to him an amusement, far away, too, scarcely to be taken seriously. Yet he had sympathy & pity for those still engaged in it. But what his secret interests & activities areâ€”to what occupation he trotted off when we left himâ€”I do not know.

Small boys write to him from New Zealand, & have to be answered. They bring out a â€œHardy numberâ€ of a Japanese paper, which he produced. Talked too about Blunden. I think Mrs H. keeps him posted in the doings of the younger poets.

Rodmell. 1926

As I am not going to milk my brains for a week, I shall here write the first pages of the greatest book in the world. This is what the book would be that was made entirely solely & with integrity of oneâ€™s thoughts. Suppose one could catch them before they became â€œworks of art.â€? Catch them hot & sudden as they rise in the mindâ€”walking up Asheham hill for instance. Of course one cannot; for the process of language is slow & deluding. One must stop to find a word; then, there is the form of the sentence, soliciting one to fill it.

Art & Thought

What I thought was this: if art is based on thought, what is the transmuting process? I was telling myself the story of our visit to the Hardys. & I began to compose it: that is to say to dwell on Mrs Hardy leaning on the table, looking out, apathetically, vaguely; & so would soon bring everything into harmony with that as the dominant theme. But the actual event was different.

Next,

Writing by living people

I scarcely ever read it. but, owing to his giving me the books, am now reading C by M. Baring. I am surprised to find it as good as it is. But how good is it? Easy to say it is not a great book. But what qualities does it lack? That it adds nothing to oneâ€™s vision of life, perhaps. Yet it is hard to find a serious flaw. My wonder is that entirely second rate work like this, poured out in profusion by at least 20 people yearly, I suppose, has so much merit. Never reading it, I get into the way of thinking it non-existent. So it is, speaking with the utmost strictness. That is, it will not exist in 2026; but it has some existence now; which puzzles me a little. Now Clarence bores me; yet I feel this is important. And why?
