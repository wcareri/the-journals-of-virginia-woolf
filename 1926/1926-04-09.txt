### Friday 9 April

Life has been very good to the Leafs. I should say it has been perfect. Why then all this pother about life? It can produce old Walter, bubbling & chubby; & old Lotta, stately & content; & little Kitty, as good & nice as can be; & handsome Charles, as loving & affectionate. Plunge deep into Walterâ€™s life & it is all sound & satisfactory. His son kisses him & says â€œBless you fatherâ€. He sinks back chuckling on his cushions. He chooses a maccaroon. He tells a story. Lotta purrsâ , in her black velvet dress. Only I am exiled from this profound natural happiness. That is what I always feel; or often feel nowâ€”natural happiness is what I lack, in profusion. I have intense happinessâ€”not that. It is therefore what I most envy; geniality & family love & being on the rails of human life. Indeed, exaggeration apart, this is a very satisfactory form of existence. And it exists for thousands of people all the time. Why have we none of us got it, in that measure? Old & young agreeing to live together: & being normal; & clever enough of course; yet not stinted or self-conscious in emotion. Much of this may be the generalised & harmonious view which one gets of unknown people as a whole. I might not think it if I saw more of them. Writers do not live like that perhaps. But it is useless frittering away the impression which is so strong. Also I keep thinking â€œThey pity me. They wonder what I find in life.â€ Then I sink a little silent, & rouse myself to talk to Kitty. Also I know that nothing Leonard or I have doneâ€”not our books or the Press or anything means anything to Lotta & Walter & Charles & very little to Kitty. Charles has his motor at the door. They are perfectly happy, motoring off to Berkhamstead, which will take an hour, so they are among the lanes even now. A spring night & so on.
