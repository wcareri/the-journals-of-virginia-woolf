### Wednesday 9 June

Then I got the flue, last Saturday; sat shivering at Lords, in the hot sunshine; so have seen no one, except basement dwellers, & put off Don Giovanni, Dadie & Hope tonight, & Osbertâ€™s dinner tomorrow. All my bubbling up faculty at once leaves me. I grind out a little of that eternal How to read, lecture, as the Yale Review has bought it, & cannot conceive what The Lighthouse is all about. I hope to whip my brains up either at Vitaâ€™s or Rodmell this weekend.

Yes, Rodmell is a perfect triumph, I considerâ€”but L. advises me not to say so. In particular, our large combined drawing eating room, with its 5 windows, its beams down the middle, & flowers & leaves nodding in all round us. The bath boils quickly; the water closets gush & surge (not quite sufficiently though). The weather again failed us, & we had a queer journey home, via Newhaven, Peacehaven & Brighton. Trains slow & scarce. The Strike, I should say, continues. We then went to a party at Edith Sitwellâ€™s (I in my new dress) â€˜to meet Miss Steinâ€™, a lady much like Joan Fry, but more massive; in blue-sprinkled brocade, rather formidable. There was Morgan, Siegfried, Toddâ€”to whom I proposed, wildly, fantastically, a bookâ€”which she accepts!â€”(& Viola so much criticised in the austere heights of Ham Spray) & Edith distraught; & cherries in handfulls, & barley waterâ€”as L. described it very brilliantly to Sybil the next day. She came: no one else; we sat & laughedâ€”& wheres the harm in this stupidish, kindly, rather amusing woman, I asked? Then she expressed a wish to dine with us. L. is lunching with Wells today.
