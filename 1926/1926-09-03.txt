### Friday 3 September

Women in tea garden at Bramberâ€”a sweltering hot day: rose trellises; white washed tables; lower middle classes; motor omnibuses constantly passing; bits of grey stone scattered on a paper strewn green sward all thats left of the Castle.

Woman leaning over the table, taking command of the treat, attended by two elder women, whom she pays for, to girl waitress (a marmalade coloured fat girl, with a body like the softest lard, destined soon to marry, but as yet only 16 or so)  
Woman â€œWhat can we have for tea?â€  
Girl (very bored, arms akimbo) Cake, bread & butter, tea: Jam?  
Woman Have the wasps been troublesome? They get into the jamâ€”as if she suspected the jam would not be worth having.  
Girl agrees.  
Woman: Ah, wasps have been very prominent this year.  
Girl Thats right.  
So she doesnâ€™t have jam.  
This amused me, I suppose.

For the rest, Charleston, Tilton, To the Lighthouse, Vita, expeditions: the summer dominated by a feeling of washing in boundless warm fresh airâ€”such an August not come my way for years: bicycling; no settled work done, but advantage taken of air for going to the river, or over the downs. The novel is now easily within sight of the end, but this, mysteriously, comes no nearer. I am doing Lily on the lawn: but whether its her last lap, I donâ€™t know. Nor am I sure of the quality; the only certainty seems to be that after tapping my antennae in the air vaguely for an hour every morning I generally write with heat & ease till 12.30: & thus do my two pages.
