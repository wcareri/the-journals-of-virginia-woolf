~~This is written~~

This is not written very seriously.â€”obviously notâ€”to try a pen, I think. And it is now April 30th, the last of a wet windy month, excepting the sudden opening of all the doors at Easter, & the summer displayed blazing, as it always is, I suppose; only cloud hidden. I have not said anything about Iwerne Minster. Now it would amuse me to see what I remember it by. Cranbourne Chase: the stunted aboriginal forest trees, scattered, not grouped in cultivations; anemones, bluebells, violets, all pale, sprinkled about, without colour, livid, for the sun hardly shone. Then Blackmore Vale; a vast air dome & the fields dropped to the bottom; the sun striking, there, there; a drench of rain falling, like a veil streaming from the sky, there & there; & the downs rising, very strongly scarped (if that is the word) so that they were ridged & ledged; then an inscription in a church â€œsought peace & ensured itâ€, & the question, who wrote these sonorous stylistic epitaphs?â€”& all the cleanliness of Iwerne village, its happiness & well being, making me ask, as we tended to sneer. Still this is the right method, surely; & then tea & creamâ€”these I remember: the hot baths; my new leather coat; Shaftesbury, so much lower & less commanding than my imagination, & the drive to Bournemouth, & the dog & the lady behind the rock, & the view of Swanage, & coming home.

And then it was horror: Nelly; faced her going; was firm yet desolate; on Tuesday she stopped me on the landing said â€œPlease maâ€™am may I apologise?â€ & this time we had been so resolute & implicitly believed her that I had written 6 letters. No cooks however came; & I had enough look into the â€˜servant questionâ€™ to be glad to be safe again with Nelly. Now I vow come what may, never never to believe her again. â€œI am too fond of you ever to be happy with anyone elseâ€ she said. Talking of compliments, this is perhaps the greatest I could have. But my mind is wandering. It is a question of clothes. This is what humiliates meâ€”talking of complimentsâ€”to walk in Regent St, Bond Str &c: & be notably less well dressed than other people.

Yesterday I finished the first part of To the Lighthouse, & today began the second. I cannot make it outâ€”here is the most difficult abstract piece of writingâ€”I have to give an empty house, no peopleâ€™s characters, the passage of time, all eyeless & featureless with nothing to cling to: well, I rush at it, & at once scatter out two pages. Is it nonsense, is it brilliance? Why am I so flown with words, & apparently free to do exactly what I like? When I read a bit it seems spirited too; needs compressing, but not much else. Compare this dashing fluency with the excruciating hard wrung battles I had with Mrs Dalloway (save the end). This is not made up: it is the literal fact. Yes, & I am rather famous. For the rest, we dally about the Nation. Maynard, dressed in a light overcoat, is back; hums & haws about standing for the Provost of Kingâ€™s. We tell him Lydia would like it. He says it means middle age & respectability. I feel some sympathy for him. This is because he is going grey, I tell Clive. Cliveâ€™s back; Nessa departing, & I worrying about my clothes, & how Roger last night upset me by saying that Nessa finds fault with my temper behind my back. Then (at Ralphâ€™s new left handed establishment) Inez, rather like Vivien to look at, searches into my eyes with her greenish pink-rimmed ones, & says, I must tell you two things: then she tells me that she admires me. That swallowed (doubtfully) she says, Did you ever have an affair with Oliver? The connection is this: she disliked me, from jealousy. I protest I never kissed him, & he never looked at me. She refuses to believe. So she has been refusing to believe for yearsâ€”A queer little interview, stage managed by Oliver* & she: at last brought off. I called in Leonard, & I think convinced her.

** Oliver denied all knowledge of this; & said she invented it in order to have an excuse for an intimate conversation. â€œSo many women are like thatâ€ said Rose Macaulay sitting spruce lean, like a mummified cat, in her chair (this is written Aug. 12th)
