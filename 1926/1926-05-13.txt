### Thursday 13 May

I suppose all pages devoted to the Strike will be skipped, when I read over this book. Oh that dull old chapter, I shall say. Excitements about what are called real things are always unutterably transitory. Yet it is gloomyâ€”& L. is gloomy, & so am I unintelligiblyâ€”today because the Strike continuesâ€”no railwaymen back: vindictiveness has now seized our masters. Government shillyshallies. Apparently, the T.U.C. agreed to terms wh. the miners now reject. Anyhow it will take a week to get the machinery of England to run again. Trains are dotted about all over England. Labour, it seems clear, will be effectively diddled again, & perhaps rid of its power to make strikes in future. Printers still out at the Nation. In short, the strain removed, we all fall out & bicker & backbite. Such is human natureâ€”& really I dont like human nature unless all candied over with art. We dined with a strike party last night & went back to Cliveâ€™s. A good deal was said about art there. Good dull Janet Vaughan, reminding me of Emma, joined us. I went to my dressmaker, Miss Brooke, & found it the most quiet & friendly & even enjoyable of proceedings. I have a great lust for lovely stuffs, & shapes; wh. I have not gratified since Sally Young died. A bold move this, but now Iâ€™m free of the fret of clothes, which is worth paying for, & need not parade Oxford Street.
