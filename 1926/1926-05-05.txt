An exact diary of the Strike would be interesting. For instance, it is now a Â¼ to 2: there is a brown fog; nobody is building; it is drizzling. The first thing in the morning we stand at the window & watch the traffic in Southampton Row. This is incessant. Everyone is bicycling; motor cars are huddled up with extra people. There are no buses. No placards, no newspapers. The men are at work in the road; water, gas & electricity are allowed; but at 11 the light was turned off. I sat in the press in the brown fog, while L. wrote an article for the Herald. A very revolutionary looking young man on a cycle arrived with the British Gazette. L. is to answer an article in this. All was military stem a little secret. Then Clive dropped in, the door being left open. He is offering himself to the Government. Maynard excited, wants the Hogarth Press to bring out a skeleton number of the Nation. It is all tedious & depressing, rather like waiting in a train outside a station. Rumours are passed roundâ€”that the gas wd. be cut off at 1â€”false of course. One does not know what to do. And nature has laid it on thick todayâ€”fog, rain, cold. A voice, rather commonplace & official, yet the only common voice left, wishes us good morning at 10. This is the voice of Britain, to wh. we can make no reply. The voice is very trivial, & only tells us that the Prince of Wales is coming back (from Biarritz), that the London streets present an unprecedented spectacle.
