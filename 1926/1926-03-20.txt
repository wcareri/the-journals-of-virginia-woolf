But what is to become of all these diaries, I asked myself yesterday. If I died, what would Leo make of them? He would be disinclined to burn them; he could not publish them. Well, he should make up a book from them, I think; & then burn the body. I daresay there is a little book in them: if the scraps & scratches were straightened out a little. God knows.

This is dictated by a slight melancholia, which comes upon me sometimes now, & makes me think I am old: I am ugly. I am repeating things. Yet, as far as I know, as a writer I am only now writing out my mind.

Dining with Clive last night to meet Lord Ivor Spencer Churchillâ€”an elegant attenuated gnat like youth; very smooth, very supple, with the semi-transparent face of a flower, & the legs of a gazelle, & the white waistcoat & diamond buttons of a dandy, & all an Americans desire to understand psycho-analysisâ€”I thought of my own age. I made a horrid gaffe early on: said I liked a picture, which I did not like, & found I was wrong. Now if I had followed my instinct, as one should do, I should have been right. For some extraordinary reason, this poisoned my evening, slightly. The Lord analysed everything very ingeniously: he is a clever boy. I was greatly impressed by masculine cleverness, & their ability to toss balls swiftly & surely to & fro: no butter fingers; all clean catches. Adrian Bishop came in; a ruddy bull frog; & then I went, & Clive, with a discrimination which was affectionate, but not just, apologised, thinking I had not talked enough for my pleasure; whereas I had said the wrong thing, & been depressed over that. Otherwise the evening amused me, & I wanted, like a child, to stay & argue. True, the argument was passing my limitsâ€”how if Einstein is true, we shall be able to foretell our own lives. Fortune tellers can now read oneâ€™s mind exactly according to Lord Ivor, who, by the bye, had read neither Henry James nor V.W., is about 23, & came to the Press this morning, obediently, to buy my complete works. No intellectual would have done that. They are excessively anxious to save their soulsâ€”these aristocrats; witness Lord Berners the other night, sending out for Peacockâ€”on my recommendation.

Otherwise, we had Bea Howe to dinner; & went to Philipâ€™s one hot still day of the usual loveliness, & saw the place, & the horses, & the pepper box towers of Waddesdon, & I liked the immense directness & uncloudedness of Babs; but says Eddy who came to tea on Sunday, this is â€œI assure youâ€ all my imagination. She would be very dull if you knew her. He knows dozens of her. Who is not dull? Only Bâ loomsbury according to Eddy.

Then there was Sybil Colefax: she comes to heel promptly: no, I wonâ€™t go there; she may have a little cheap tea here, which she does, gratefully. She has done America with the usual dashing, joyless efficiency; could not analyse, merely report. Charlie Chaplin such a mixture of subtlety & commonâ ness: but why? No instances available, so I infer that she picked this up second hand, perhaps from Esme Howard; perhaps from Coolidge, or from Douglas Fairbanks or from the Italian boy who drove the car. Like a good housewife, which she is, she is making Peter begin life hard, cooking his breakfast, down on Wall Street by 9. There is a strain of hard, serious, professionalism in her, quite unmitigated by all the splendours of Argyll House.
