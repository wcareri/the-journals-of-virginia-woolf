### Saturday 12 December

I have never been able to afford 2/ for a good piece of washleather, yet I buy a dozen boxes of matches for 1/6.  
I am giving up the hope of being well dressed.  
Violet Dickinson has just had a third serious operation & I went to an old Curiosity shop instead of going to see her.  
Leonard is lunching with Maynard & a great registered parcel has just been delivered containing Dadieâ€™s dissertation.  
It is now close on 3.30.  
Some superstition prevents me from reading Yeatsâ€™ autobiography as I should like.  
I am very happy at the moment: having arranged my week on the whole well.  
But I have been rather unscupulous. I have put off the Stephens, at Thorpe: & shall probably stay at Knole.  
A few thoughts to fill up time waiting for dinner.  
An article all about London:  
How Vitaâ€™s inkpot flowered on her table.  
Loganâ€™s vanity: I write everything 8 timesâ€”  
(So thats how its done I thought: he thought thats the only way to produce writing like mine)  
But all my thoughts perish instantly. I make them up so vast. How to blunt the sting of an unpleasant remark: to say it over & over & over again. Walked to Violetâ€™s; took her a red carnation & a white one. My feelings quickened as I drew near. I visualised the operation as I stood on the doorstep.  
I also have made up a passage for The Lighthouse: on people going away & the effect on oneâ€™s feeling for them.  
But reading Yeats turns my sentences one way: reading Sterne turns them another.
