### Wednesday 24 February

To continue, the second day running which is a rarity, they came last night, Francis & Rose Macaulayâ€”I daresay I shall be calling her Rose one of these days. Francis didnâ€™t much relish meeting her: my gnats of worries gave me little peace: Gwen ringing up; I not cordial; she shying off: I repentant; ringing up again. Then Roseâ€”too chattery chittery at first go off; lean as a rake, wispy, & frittered. Some flimsy smartness & taint of the flimsy glittery literary about her: but this was partly nerves, I think; & she felt us alien & observant doubtless. Anyhow in the middle of dinner the lights went out: only a few candles in saucers to be had, & I left her & Francis alone in the dark to talk. After all, she has no humbug about her; is exactly on a par as far as conventions go, I imagine; only frosted & rather cheaply gilt superficially with all that being asked to speak at dinners, to give opinions to newspapers, & so on; lunching at the League of Nations; dining with Iolo Williams, meeting Jack Squire who has grown whiskers & looks like a verger.

Let me see, thereâ€™s some failure of sympathy between Chiswick & Bloomsbury, I think, she said. So we defined Bloomsbury. Her part is to stick up for common sense she said. I elaborated her being Cambridge. She is writing an article for an American paper on London after the War. It is this sort of thing that one distrusts in her. Why should she take the field so unnecessarily? But I fancy our â€˜leading lady novelistsâ€™ all do as they are asked about this, & I am not quite one of them. I saw my own position, a good deal lowered & diminished; & this is part of the value of seeing new peopleâ€”still more of going to peopleâ€™s houses. One is, if anything, minimised: here in the eternal Bloomsbury, one is apt, without realising it, to expand. Then Gwen came. I like Francis. I like his laughter; & his random energy. He is a Victorian. Indeed we talked a lot, when L. was in the basement with the electrician, of father, who, said Francis, dominates the 20th Century. â€œHe made it possible for me to have a decent lifeâ€ he said. â€œHe pulled down the whole edifice, & never knew what he was doing. He never realised that if God went, morality must follow. A remarkable man; for though he would not believe in God, he was stricter than those who did.â€

â€œHe loved lamentationâ€ said L. coming up. R.M. said her parents called him always â€œpoor Leslie Stephenâ€ because he had lost his faith. Also they said he was very gentle & charming. Gwen said her father & uncles had a great respect for him. They had a very romantic feeling for my mother.

Because she was so beautiful, I said, proud that R.M. should know this; & felt rather queer, to think how much of this there is in To the Lighthouse, & how all these people will read it & recognise poor Leslie Stephen & beautiful Mrs Stephen in it. Then we talked of knowing people. R.M. said she always knew why she liked people. Gwen being perhaps tired, was a little mystical; or perhaps she has acquired views which are yet hardly articulate. Anyhow Leonard thought her â€˜almost imbecileâ€™. They got talking about whether one knew more about pictures or books. R.M. showed up rather well in argument, & maintained that a book is a subjective thing; she attacks authority in literature. But people know about painting as it is a more technical art. Then she said (this makes me think she will wish to be called Rose) how she had dreamt she was staying with us in a cottage in Surrey, a 15th century house, full of old beams & candle lit. In some lights she has the beautiful eyes of all us distinguished women writers; the refinement; the clearness of cut; the patience; & humbleness. It is her voice & manner that make one edgy.
