### Thursday 22 July

The summer hourglass is running out rapidly & rather sandily. Many nights I wake in a shudder thinking of some atrocity of mine. I bring home minute pinpricks which magnify in the middle of the night into gaping wounds. However, I drive my pen through de Quincey of a morning, having put The Lighthouse aside till Rodmell. There all virtue, all good, is in retreat. Here nothing but odds & endsâ€”going to the dentist, buying combs; having Maynard & Bob to tea, & then Ralph & Frances to dinner, followed by Eddie & Kitchen. But we are both jaded, & get no clear impression any more from the human faceâ€”must dine with Osbert Sitwell tonight though, & go to Hardy tomorrow. This is human life: this is the infinitely precious stuff issued in a narrow roll to us now, & then withdrawn for ever; & we spend it thus. Days without definite sensation are the worst of all. Days when one compells oneself to undergo this or that for some reasonâ€”but what reason?

There is nothing important at the moment to record: or if so, & oneâ€™s state of mind is overwhelmingly important, I leave that, too for Rodmell. There I shall come to grips with the last part of that python, my book; it is a tug & a struggle, & I wonder now & then, why I let myself in for it. Rose Macaulay said â€œWhat else would one do with oneâ€™s thoughts?â€ I have not seen her again nor Gwen, nor written to Violet; nor learnt French, nor finished Clarissa.

Desmond came in; talked about Shakespeare. Now to settle my mind to Suspiria.
