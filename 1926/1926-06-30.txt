### Wednesday 30 June

This is the last day of June & finds me in black despair because Clive laughed at my new hat, Vita pitied me, & I sank to the depths of gloom. This happened at Cliveâ€™s last night after going to the Sitwells with Vita. Oh dear I was wearing the hat without thinking whether it was good or bad; & it was all very flashing & easy; & there I saw a man with braided hair, another with long red tongues in his button hole; & sat by Vita & laughed & clubbed. When we got out it was only 10.30â€”a soft starry night: I had refused to go to Colefax: it was still too early for her to go. So she said â€œShall we go to Cliveâ€™s & pick him up?â€ & I was then again so lighthearted, driving through the park, & seeing people scud before us. Also we saw all the Mayfair houses, & finally came to Gordon Sqre & there was Nessa tripping along in the dark, in her quiet black hat. So we had some lively talk. She said Duncan was having a sandwich at the public house: then he came, carrying an egg. Come on all of us to Cliveâ€™s, I said; & they agreed. Well, it was after they had come & we were all sitting round talking that Clive suddenly said, or bawled rather, what an astonishing hat youâ€™re wearing! Then he asked where I got it. I pretended a mystery, tried to change the talk, was not allowed, & they pulled me down between them, like a hare; I never felt more humiliated. Clive said did Mary choose it? No. Todd said Vita. And the dress? Todd of course: after that I was forced to go on as if nothing terrible had happened; but it was very forced & queer & humiliating. So I talked & laughed too much. Duncan prim & acid as ever told me it was utterly impossible to do anything with a hat like that. And I joked about the Squiresâ€™ party. & Leonard got silent, & I came away deeply chagrined, as unhappy as I have been these ten years; & revolved it in sleep & dreams all night; & today has been ruined.
