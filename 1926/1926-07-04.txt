### Sunday 4 July

Then Wells came again; & stayed till 4, when he had to meet an American. He is getting to the drowsy stage: the 60s. Seems well wishing but not so spry as he used to be. He talked about his new book, the thoughts one has at 60. He brings in everythingâ€”a man called Lubin, for instance, who invented intn agriculture (I think) a man who died in poverty & was shuffled out of the way to his grave in Rome the day that Wilson made his entryâ€”â€œthat shallow, pretentious empty headed professorâ€â€”Lubin was the real thinker for peace. What other ideas had he? Desmond asked. Well, to do away with Sunday. There should be a holiday once in 10 days. That was his own stint. 10 days work, then 4 or 5 days off. The present system is wasteful. The shadow of the week end begins on Friday, is not over till Monday afternoon. He said sometimes he wrote all day for days; sometimes not at all. He struck me again as an odd mixture of bubble & solidityâ€”likes to blow a phrase now & then. We got him on to Hardyâ€”a very simple, subtle old peasant man much impressed by clever people who writeâ [;] very humble, delighted when Wells took Rebecca West to call on him, walked half way into Dorchester with themâ€”â€œan impudent young journalistâ€ Wells called her. Hardy had heard of her. Came to stay with Barrie to see an air raidâ€”wrote his early books in chapters as the printers wanted them. Then he got up to go: we asked him to stay & tell us about Henry James. So he sat down. Oh I should be delighted to stay & talk the whole afternoon, he said. Henry James was a formalist. He always thought of clothes. He was never intimate with anyoneâ€”not with his brother even: had never been in love. Once his brother wanted to see Chesterton, & climbed a ladder & looked over a wall. This angered Henry; who called in Wells & asked him for an opinionâ€”as if I had one! Wells has learnt nothing from Proustâ€”his book like the British Museum. One knows there are delightful interesting things in it, but one does not go there. One day it may be wetâ€”I shall say God, what am I to do this afternoon? & I shall read Proust as I might go to the British Museum. Would not read Richardsonâ€”a man who knows all about feminine psychology (with some contempt) nobody ought to know that. I said on the contrary he knew very little: was conventional. Honour, chastity & so on. Wells said we had changed our ideas completely. That idea of chastity had vanished. Women were even more suggestible than men. Now they dont think about itâ€”a chaste little couple (he talks of little couples) mixing with a promiscuous little couple. He said we are happier perhapsâ€”children are certainly more at ease with their parents. But he thought they were beginning to miss restraints. They were wondering what things were for. They were very restless; discussing Henry James & Eliot, & how formal they are & overdone with mannerâ€”(he described H.J. pushing under a letter he was writing to talk to Wells â€œat the Reformâ€)â€”I said it was American. They were alien to our civilisation. He said he had been that himself. His father was a gardener, his mother a ladies maid. He found it very strange to meet people who went to parties & wore dress clothes. Henry James could not describe loveâ€”there comes the ahhâ€”laying on of hands. This Wells could do himself. I am a journalist. I pride myself upon being a journalist he said. Well I have a sort of feeling that all writing should be journalismâ€”(done with an object)â€”One knows nothing of what posterity will wantâ€”may be a guide book. I tell Arnold they will read him for his topography.

In all this he showed himself, as Desmond said afterwards, perfectly content to be himself, aware of his powers,â€”aware that he need not take any trouble, since his powers were big enough.
