### Tuesday 28 September

Every day I have meant to record a state of mind. But it has always disappeared (characteristically) yet recurred often enough to make it one of some importance. It is raining hard this evening; we have entered the calm period of Nellyâ€™s departure. So I will try, before my fingers chill & my mind wanders to the fire, to write here what I can remember.

Intense depression: I have to confess that this has overcome me several times since September 6th (I think that, or thereabouts was the date.) It is so strange to me that I cannot get it rightâ€”the depression, I mean, which does not come from something definite, but from nothing. â€œWhere there is nothingâ€ the phrase came (back) to me, as I sat at the table in the drawing room. Of course I was interested; & discovered that, for the first time for many years, I had been idle without being ill. We had been walking, expeditioning, in the hot fine weather. I was writing the last pages of To the Lighthouse (finished, provisionally, Sept 16th). Somehow, my reading had lapsed. I was hunting no hares. One night I got hold of Geoffrey Scottâ€™s book on Architecture, & a little spark of motive power awoke in me. This is a warning then; never to cease the use of the brain. So I used my brain. Then, owing to mismanagement, no one came to stay, & I got very few letters; & the high pure hot days went on & on; & this blankness persisted, & I began to suspect my book of the same thing; & there was Nessa humming & booming & flourishing over the hill; & one night we had a long long argument. Vita started it, by coming over with Plank, & L. (I say) spoilt the visit by glooming because I said he had been angry. He shut up, & was caustic. He denied this, but admitted that my habits of describing him, & others, had this effect often. I saw myself, my brilliancy, genius, charm, beauty (&c. Seethe attendants who float me through so many years) diminish & disappear. One is in truth rather an elderly dowdy fussy ugly incompetent woman vain, chattering & futile. I saw this vividly, impressively. Then he said our relations had not been so good lately. On analysing my state of mind I admitted that I had been irritated, first by the prevalency of the dogs (Grizzle on heat too.) Secondly by his assumption that we can afford to saddle ourselves with a whole time gardener, build or buy him a cottage, & take in the terrace to be garden. Then, I said, we shall be tying ourselves to come here; shall never travel; & it will be assumed that Monks House is the hub of the world. This it certainly is not, I said, to me; nor do I wish to spend such a measure of our money on gardens, when we cannot buy rugs, beds or good arm chairs. L. was, I think, hurt at this, & I was annoyed at saying it, yet did it, not angrily, but in the interests of freedom. Too many women give way on this point, & secretly grudge their unselfishness in silenceâ€”a bad atmosphere. Our atmosphere decidedly cleared, after this, Tommie came for the week end, & I am once more full of work, at high pressure, interested, & quite unable, I see, to make plain even to my own eyes, my season of profound despondency.

If I wish to avoid this in future, I recommend, first, incessant brain activity; reading, & planning; second, a methodical system of inviting people here (which is possible, with Nelly obedient & gay); third, increased mobility. For next year, I shall arrange perhaps to go definitely to Ethel Sands. With my motor I shall be more mobile.

But it is always a question whether I wish to avoid these glooms. In part they are the result of getting away by oneself, & have a psychological interest which the usual state of working & enjoying lacks. These 9 weeks give one a plunge into deep waters; which is a little alarming, but full of interest. All the rest of the year oneâ€™s (I daresay rightly) curbing & controlling this odd immeasurable soul. When it expands, though one is frightened & bored & gloomy, it is as I say to myself, awfully queer. There is an edge to it which I feel of great importance, once in a way. One goes down into the well & nothing protects one from the assault of truth. Down there I cant write or read; I exist however. I am. Then I ask myself what I am? & get a closer though less flattering answer than I should on the surfaceâ€”where, to tell the truth, I get more praise than is right. But the praise will go; one will be left alone with this queer being in old age. I am glad to find it on the whole so interesting, though so acutely unpleasant. Also, I can, by taking pains, be much more considerate of L.â€™s feelings; & so keep more steadily at our ordinary level of intimacy & ease: a level, I think, no other couple so long married, reaches, & keeps so constantly.
