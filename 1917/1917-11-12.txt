### Monday 12 November

Today weâ€™ve been to London, as usually happens on Monday. We went to the Omega, & as we were looking round us, in came Roger, which embarrassed me a little, partly because of his own pictures, & also because I donâ€™t like talking of art in front of him. He was in process of painting a table though, & disappeared. Then we went to Gordon Sqre to fetch my umbrella, 2 pictures, & a hair binder, all left there, & who should open the door but Clive? He asked us in, & there was M.H. in one of the big armchairs, a piteous half moon of a woman, to my thinking. She seems so crushed & submissive always. I half smoked a gold-tipped cigarette, & listened to some Garsington gossip. K.M. has broken with Ott. in a letter which says â€œYou shanâ€™t play the Countess to my cook any moreâ€ or words to that effect. We left however, & I went to Mudies, & got The Leading Note, in order to examine into R.T. more closely, & L. went on to meet Edgar for a mysterious interview; & I came home with my book, which does not seem a very masterly performance after Turgenev, I suppose; but if you dont get your touches in the right place the method is apt to be sketchy & empty. L. is at the Suffrage; & I watch 3 fireballs glowing red hot.
