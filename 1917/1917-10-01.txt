### Monday 1 October

Bicycled in to Lewes - there & back. Passed a drunk man being driven into Lewes on his fruit cart by a policeman. Met another shouting held by 2 policemen in Lewes. Market presumably. Shopped. Met Roger. Anxious about raids. Another last night between 7 & 8: we listened but saw & heard nothing. The weather still perfectly fine warm without wind. Men came & fetched fallen trees, dragging them with horses.
