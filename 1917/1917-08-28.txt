### Tuesday 28 August

Another most appalling day. Leaves & swallows blown about in the field; garden dishevelled. Branches down across the road; corn cocks tumbled over; rain drenching. Servants had meant to go to Brighton, but gave up. Had forgotten to order meat, so had to walk to Firle. Wind behind us going. A tree down at corner by the pond, made a frightful noise as one went beneath them. But it stopped raining, & there was some blue sky over the downs. Early closing in Firle. Grocer doing stamps in lamplight. Telephone broken by gale. Home against the wind, but dry. German prisoners now working for Hoper: work very well, if given tea at 4:30, wh. they insist upon, & will then work an extra hour. Impossible to carry corn in this weather. Gunn comes very seldom. Harvest wh. was good, now said to be ruined. Rain started again in the evening. Had to have a candle to end dinner with. Fires before dinner.
