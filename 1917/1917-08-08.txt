### Wednesday 8 August

Mist again. Went to post at Southease. L.â€™s foot very bad. Saw wooded pews put into traction engine at Rodmell Church; a man without a hand, a hook instead. Met Mrs Attfield with dead chicken in a parcel, found dead in the nettles, head wrung off, perhaps by a person. Home over downs. Fair haul of mushrooms again, best in hollow. Alix came; rain storm after tea, then fine.
