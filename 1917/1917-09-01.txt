### Saturday 1 September

In spite of a perfect moonlit night, mist rain & wind, black all over the downs this morning. As bad as ever. However it blew so hard that it stopped raining in the afternoon. We went into the hollow, started a great hare, & then saw a man shooting. In fact they had shot at pigeons very near us. We went round & over the top. Seems now mid-autumn or even early winter from the look of things. Trees an ugly leaden colour outside, as if shrivelled, flowers beaten down & brown; butterflies scarcely flying.

L. to Lewes to meet Mrs W(oolf). & B. who came here about 7. Lovely night again. A great white owl, looking like a sea gull, sat on the rail, & flew about. Mushrooms started on my patch. L. took wasps.
