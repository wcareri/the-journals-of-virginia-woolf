### Saturday 22 September

Another very fair day, though well in autumn now. The rooks settling on the trees, & making a great noise in the early morning. A few walnuts ripe. Dahlia fully out in the bed. Trees now so thin that I can see the postman through them at the top of the hill. Clover in field opposite has been cut, & lies on the field. Still some corn standing across on the downs. Sat on the terrace after lunch: L. did garden. D. went to Glynde after tea; we sat over fire.
