### Thursday 22 November

I boasted so much about this book & the charm of filling it from a never exhausted fount at Garsington that Iâ€™m ashamed to miss days; & yet as I point out, the only chance it has is to wait oneâ€™s mood. Ottoline keeps one by the way, devoted however to her â€œinner lifeâ€; which made me reflect that I havenâ€™t an inner life. She read me a passage in my praise though, so the realities do come in sometimes. On Tuesday L. went to Williams & Norgate, who offer terms for a 2/6 bookâ€”which must be considered. Evidently they want him very much; & canâ€™t altogether conceal this in spite of their wish to drive a hard bargain. I rather think I finished taking down a page. Anyhow on Wednesday Barbara came to make a start, & the machine thereupon completely struck work, one of the rollers being cut, & jibbing, & as our stock of Kâ€™s ran out, she could only set 4 lines. This she did however, quickly & without fault, so that she promises well. She bicycled from Wimbledon, her small crop head, bright cheeks, brilliant waistcoat give her a likeness to some vivacious bird; but I donâ€™t know that I think this very emphatic appearance particularly interesting. It always seems to say â€œNow all the decks are cleared for actionâ€ & action there is none.

I dined with Roger & met Clive. We sat at the low square table covered with a bandanna, & eat out of dishes each holding a different bean or lettuce: delicious food for a change. We drank wine, & finished with soft white cheese, eaten with sugar. Then, taking a splendid flight above personalities, we discussed literature & aesthetics.

â€œDâ€™you know, Clive, Iâ€™ve made out a little more about the thing which is essential to all art: you see, all art is representative. You say the word tree, & you see a tree. Very well. Now every word has an aura. Poetry combines the different auraâ€™s in a sequenceâ€”â€ That was something like it. I said one could, & certainly did, write with phrases, not only words; but that didnâ€™t help things on much. Roger asked me if I founded my writing upon texture or upon structure; I connected structure with plot, & therefore said â€œtextureâ€. Then we discussed the meaning of structure & texture in painting & in writing. Then we discussed Shakespeare, & Roger said Giotto excited him just as much. This went on till I made myself go precisely at 10. And we discussed also Chinese poetry; Clive said the whole thing was too distant to be comprehensible. Roger compared the poetry with the painting. I liked it all very much (the talk I mean). Much no doubt is perfectly vague, not to be taken seriously, but the atmosphere puts ideas into oneâ€™s head, & instead of having to curtail them, or expatiate, one can speak them straight out & be understoodâ€”indeed disagreed with. Old Roger takes a gloomy view, not of our life, but of the worldâ€™s future; but I think I detected the influence of Trotter & the herd, & so I distrusted him. Still, stepping out into Charlotte Street, where the Bloomsbury murder took place a week or two ago, & seeing a crowd swarming in the road & hearing women abuse each other & at the noise others come running with delightâ€”all this sordidity made me think him rather likely to be right.

Today has been a perfectly warm, very still day, & we just had time after printing off a page to reach the river & see everything reflected perfectly straightly in the water. The red roof of a house had its own little cloud of red in the riverâ€”lights lit on the bridge made long streaks of yellowâ€”very peaceful, & as if the heart of winter.
