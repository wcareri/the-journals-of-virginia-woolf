### Thursday 30 August

Not actually raining, though dark so the servants went to Brighton. I went over the Down; L. cut the grass in the garden. Trees have suddenly turned brown & shrivelled on their exposed sides, though still green in shelter; as if dried up by very hot sun. No autumn tints. Blue butterflies ragged & washed out. L. was stung on the ankle by a wasp. He cut into their nest. Barbara & Nick Bagenal came over to tea & dinner, which we had to scratch up for them, servants being out. Rain came on after dinner again; but wind much fallen.
