### Monday 3 September

Perfect day; completely blue without cloud or wind, as if settled for ever. Watched dog herding sheep. Rooks beginning to fly over the trees, both morning & evening, sometimes with starlings. Mrs W. & B. went after lunch. Took us to Lewes with them. Asked about watch; but can't get it done for 3 months. Boots gone up to 40/- but found an old 15/ pair in a small shop, wh. I bought; & then found a good pair in the cupboard at home. Back by train; L. bicycled. Made a straight line across fields from Glynde, a very good way. Met Nelly bringing back Co-op. box, so walked with her. Evening so fine we went out again into the hollow. Saw a shining spot, which we could not find when we came up to it. Painted Lady (Vanessa cardui) seen near Glynde.
