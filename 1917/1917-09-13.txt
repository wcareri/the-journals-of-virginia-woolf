### Thursday 13 September

A windy day. I went onto the down, after going to Southease. They have taken a slice out of the church tower; you can see a wooden frame inside. Blew up a storm of rain, had a fire after tea; servants to Charleston, home in storm over the downs. Had tea in kitchen, & saw old man who is thatching the ricks raking apples off the tree into a bucket. L. called out ''When you've done!'' & he ran away.
