### Monday 24 September

Desmond left at 9 in the fly. An absolutely perfect autumn day. Lewes half under mist, gradually lifting. No wind. To Lewes. I to Glynde, L. bicycling all the way in order to buy plants. I met Duncan at Glynde, going on his holidays. Had 2 pears. Great crowd for the London train. Apparently my letter to Nessa lost. Shopped in Lewes. Back to Glynde & bicycled home, through a herd of Alderneys; goat got in front & ran some way. Superb sunset. Men working very late carting the clover. A threshing machine at work behind the wood.
