### Wednesday 26 September

A rather cold day, though fine. L. picked apples, having borrowed the shepherd's ladder. I went to post at Southease. Passed 2 troops of cadets, each headed by officer & chaplain. Home over the down - a stray horse running along the road the only other incident. Our sunflowers out now. A shooting party walking about, firing a good deal.
