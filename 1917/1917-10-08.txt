### Monday 8 October

This attempt at a diary is begun on the impulse given by the discovery in a wooden box in my cupboard of an old volume, kept in 1915, & still able to make us laugh at Walter Lamb. This therefore will follow that plan - written after tea, written indiscreetly, & by the way I note here that L. has promised to add his page when he has something to say. His modesty is to be overcome. We planned today to get him an autumn outfit in clothes, & to stock me with paper & pens. This is the happiest day that exists for me. It rained steadily of course. London seems unchanged, making me think of the change there used to be when one was a child. There was a man buying boots who had such a taste in boots that he knew different cuts & rows of nails; & was very cross when told his pair was ''nice & strong''. ''I hate nice, strong boots'' he growled. Evidently there is a taste in boots. We walked through Gough Sqre; Dr Johnson's house a fine, very well kept place, not so shabby as I expected. A little square, folded in behind Chancery Lane, & given over to printing presses. This is the best part of London to look at - not I now think to live in. Carrying my manuscript to the Times I felt like a hack much in keeping.' We left it with a porter, & ran into Bruce Richmond, shining out a perfect gentleman in white gloves on the Ludgate Hill platform. He flourished his hat & disappeared. Liz has a son; therefore our fears as to paternity are set at rest.
