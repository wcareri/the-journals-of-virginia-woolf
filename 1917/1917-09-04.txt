### Tuesday 4 September

Woke to find the house in a mist. We have seen this on the meadows at night. It cleared, & was a perfect day, almost without wind. In the afternoon we began to pick our apples; I did the lower ones & L. the higher ones, on a farm ladder. In the middle, Clive & Mary H. appeared, so I had to stop. They stayed for tea & dinner, & walked back over the downs.
