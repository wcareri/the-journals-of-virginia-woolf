### Wednesday 3 October

Not such a fine day. Wind rose, & grew cloudy. However, the raids will be stopped. Did the garden path all the afternoon. Planted some wall flowers, daisies, foxgloves. Into the hollow after tea, when almost dark. Had to send Will in for book to Lewes. Got windier. He only came back at 10; knocked, & could not make us hear (so he says).
