### Sunday 16 September

An almost sunless, but fine day. Clouds too high for rain. Walked to Firle & had picnic. L. went on with Kodak to Charleston. I waited for him by the trees. After a time, Robin Mayor & Bobo M. came, to my surprise: at Talland (wh. they still have) for week end: had let it to Belgians. L. came back; N(essa). thought the Kodak wd. cause great Jealousy, so kept it. Silver Queen over sea; a bar of red across the sea, like last Sunday. Will brought his ferrets & caught a rabbit for the servants.
