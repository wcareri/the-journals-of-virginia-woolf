### Tuesday 18 September

A furious wet day; rain lashing across, sea mist when not pouring. Nevertheless we started for Lewes; but were driven back at the turning by the water mill. Spent afternoon indoors, a treat. Settled down after dinner to print photographs, deciding that D(esmond) wouldn't come; but he arrived at 8; had driven out in a fly; had to find some dinner for him.
