### Thursday 16 August

L. & G.L.D. played chess all the afternoon. I went to post at Southease; the church now surrounded by scaffolding poles, & old wood panels leaning against the wall; bricklayers sitting by the gate. Woman asked me to find her children pad[d]ling in river: they did not want to go home. L.S. arrived. went into the hollow.
