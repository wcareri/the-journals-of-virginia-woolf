### Wednesday 14 November

L. gave his lecture; I presided over my guild. It always puzzles me to know why the women come, unless they like sitting in a room not their own, gas & light free, other women on other chairs. They donâ€™t pay much attention apparently; save Mrs Langston no one has a word to offer. Tonight Mrs Allanâ€”a rosy, bright eyed, shrewd, but not very enlightened woman spoke for an hour upon Congress. It might have been a report; & had little more interest. When sheâ€™d done, & Iâ€™d done, no questions were asked, & she started off upon foodâ€”not the food of the country, but the individual dinner & tea provided at Torquay. Upon this subject she spoke fluently & even passionately for 15 minutes. The vices of outside traders & the virtues of self control were both illustrated at length. L. was back about 10.30, after a more profitable evening at the U.D.C. where soldiers & an Indian were among the audience. Today the servants went to see Bert in hospital at Epsom; L. went to the Dogs Home, with no result; & finally we walked towards Kew, & noticed how the great chestnut trees (were) as black and bare as iron. A dozen men stand fishing in the quiet water beneath the lockâ€”a cheerful sign of undiminished stability. We looked in, & spent half an hour, talking to the little printer, who has 2 machines & 1 press for sale. The difficulty is to decide; but probably we shall buy one, & leave the refinements of perfection for the present, which Riddell thinks necessary, but presumably canâ€™t provide. Besides, these machines are running & only cost Â£14 or Â£15.

Again a day of no letters.
