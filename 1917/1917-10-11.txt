### Thursday 11 October

The dinner last night went off: the delicate things were discussed. We could both wish that ones first impression of K.M. was not that she stinks like aâ€”well civet cat that had taken to street walking. In truth, Iâ€™m a little shocked by her commonness at first sight; lines so hard & cheap. However, when this diminishes, she is so intelligent & inscrutable that she repays friendship. My sayingâ€”Chaste & the Unchasteâ€”was exaggerated by Murry for reasons of his own; reasons that make him wish all of a sudden to break with Garsington. We discussed Henry James, & K.M. was illuminating I thought. A munition worker called Leslie Moor came to fetch herâ€”another of these females on the border land of propriety, & naturally inhabiting the underworldâ€”rather vivacious, sallow skinned, without any attachment to one place rather than another. Today poor L. had to go the round of Drs & committees, with a visit to Squire thrown in. His certifications are repeated. He weighs only 9.6. I bought my winter store of gloves, got a reference in the London Library, & met L. at Spikings for tea. Heaven blessed us by sending a quick train, & we came home, very glad to be home, over our fire, though we had to light it, & cook up our dinner, owing to the servants off day.
