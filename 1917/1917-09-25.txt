### Tuesday 25 September

The day looked so fine that we planned a picnic at Telscombe. However it turned windy with a strange black haze over the sun-like a sea mist gone black, & only in parts, for it was very fine over Lewes. But it seemed too cold to picnic far away, so we went into the valley by the deserted farm. Saw a woman painting, & asked her to keep an eye on my bicycle. Went into the valley, up a little on the other side. Had tea there. Found a field of corn flowers & poppies, apparently sewn in rows. Picked a bunch, also some roots wh. L. has planted in the front garden.
