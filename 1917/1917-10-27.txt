### Saturday 27 October

We were just setting off for Kingston Barracks this afternoon to get L.â€™s exemption card, when the telephone rang, & I heard Cliveâ€™s now unfamiliar & apparently rather nervous voice asking whether he might dine with us. So the breach is to be repaired very rapidly. We walked through the Park to Kingston, failed to get the card, & then had tea in Kingston, ending by buying me a 15/ watch for my wristâ€”a round bright, serviceable turnip, which I look at constantly, & really find it a saver of time. We were back late; & Clive came & was I thought, very pleasant, easy garrulous; starting a great many hares & chasing them smartly, & letting off his little tributes to himself quite inoffensively. He is so brisk & well kept mentally that I like an evening of him. L. immensely good tempered & urbane into the bargain. We gossiped; spun swiftly from thing to thingâ€”Characters, French books, the Mansfield intrigue, & so on. He wears his chestnut suit; combs his hair back to hide the bald spot, but didnâ€™t hitch his trousers so much as usualâ€”in short, he was at his best. Adrian has a drs. order not to work on the land any longer.
