Its odd how fate crams money into our mouths when weâ€™ve got enough, & starves us when weâ€™re empty. Here weâ€™ve made 270 (I think) in Bah Lias, & this morning they write to say that Mitchells is paying 4/ in Â£. so that brings us another Â£120. Two years ago we had awkward debts, & had to sell out to pay them. We both make big or fairly big cheques monthly by reviewing. We started printing in earnest after lunch, & Alix came punctually; was instructed, & left on her high stool while we took the air with Tinkler, who jumped from a parapet into a boat covered with tarpaulin, crashed through, & out again, unhurt though surprised. We came back to find Perera, wearing his slip & diamond initial in his tie as usual; in fact, the poor little mahogany coloured wretch has no variety of subjects. The character of the Governor, & the sins of the Colonial Office, these are his topics; always the same stories, the same point of view, the same likeness to a caged monkey, suave on the surface, inscrutable beyond. He made me uncomfortable by producing an eâ (n)â velope of laceâ€”â€œa souvenir from Ceylon Mrs Woolfâ€â€”more correctly a bribe, but there was no choice but to take it. He being gone upstairs, Alix solemnly & slowly explained that she was bored, & also worried by her 2 hours composing, & wished to give it up. A sort of morbid scrutiny of values & of motives, joined with crass laziness, leads her to this decision; as I expect it will lead her to many more. She has a good brain, but not enough vitality to keep it working. The idea weighed upon her, & I assured her there was no need for it to weigh.
