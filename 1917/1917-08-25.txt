### Saturday 25 August

I went to post at Southeast. L. gardened. Another windy day. Seeing the church surrounded by scaffolding, I went in, found floor up, pews taken away, ladders all about. A notice to say that restoration will cost Â£227. The church there in 966 A.D. Holes in the tower & roof visible. Men at work carting corn in the field by the road.
