### Tuesday 2 October

Another fine day. Started the path in the walled garden this afternoon, & the flower bed by it. We make the path with cobbles from the wall, & work the old cement in. Great fun to do, & looks very nice from the drawing room already. Children came to tea. Looked about the house; we gave them 2 of L's heads of deer which they liked very much. Walked a little way back, & onto the down for mushrooms, which have begun again. Had to lie down to escape Henry who ran over the top. Clouded after tea. Heard firing.
