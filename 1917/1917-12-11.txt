### Tuesday 11 December

The infliction of our apprentice. Things on the whole went better; & L. & I slipped out for half an hour before tea, into the brownish red light of the wintry afternoon. The green gives a very good sample of the sky & bare trees, one or two old rooks nests in the upper twigs. Back to tea; & Perera came for private talk. I own that I sounded the very depths of boredom with Barbara. She gives out facts precisely as she received themâ€”minute facts about governesses & houses. And no doubt of her own adequacy crosses her mind; all so nice, honest, sensible, how can there be a flaw? Indeed, one figures her nature as a flawless marble, impervious, unatmospheric. And the time passed; she missed her train; waited on for anotherâ€”waited until 6.10; & we were to dine at 7â€”& my evening fretted away without sensation, save of one standing under the drip of a water spout. My excuse for such extravagance is that I had to go in to the Guild today. No speaker came, & we were clearing the table at 9 after a lot of letter reading & intermittent discussion when a private omen came true. The speaker arrived. A Mrs Moore from Kensal Rise: middle class; dressed in velvet; vulgar, fluent. Spoke on propaganda for 20 minutes; more words than brain, & indeed she couldnâ€™t explain her sayings to the satisfaction of Mrs Langston, & was perturbed when I showed how much I knew. But I admired the way in which she got her steam up when we were all anxious to go. The women said it was a splendid speech; sentences that melt into each other impress them.
