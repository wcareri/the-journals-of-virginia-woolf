### Wednesday 10 October

No air raid; no further disturbance by our countryâ€™s needs; in fact L. made out in his bath that he deserved some good fortune, & opening his letters found a cheque for Â£12 from a Swedish paper which never was born & yet pays its debts. And I had 4/ for myself. Late last night, I was told to have my Henry James done if possible on Friday, so that I had to make way with it this morning, & as I rather grudge time spent on articles, & yet cant help spending it if I have it, I am rather glad that this is now out of my power. And another article upon the country in Hardy & E. BrontÃ« is suggested. We walked down the river, through the park, & back to an early tea. At this moment L. is bringing the 17 Club into existence. I am sitting over the fire, & we have the prospect of K. Mansfield to dinner, when many delicate things fall to be discussed. We notice how backward the leaves are in falling & yellowing here compared with Asheham. It might still be August, save for the acorns scattered on the pathâ€”suggesting to us the mysterious dispensation which causes them to perish, or we should be a forest of oaks.
