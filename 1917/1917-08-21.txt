### Tuesday 21 August

L. to London for second conference. Very hot. L.S. went to Charleston after tea. K.M. & I walked on M.'s walk. The thistledown beginning to blow. Saw the Silver Queen over the down, going towards Brighton & coming back again. A great many aeroplanes passed over the house. Most of the butterflies have red spots on their necks some parasite. Planted a red flower with bulb given by Mrs Wooler to Nelly - some sort of lily.
