### Sunday 11 November

Sunday, I see, is becoming for us much what it was to our fathers, the day on which social life becomes swept; & as itâ€™s by the nature of things a dull solemn day, the plan isnâ€™t so bad. Still, I hardly see on what principle one can approve of our luncheon at the Webbs. L. has known them;

(In LWâ€™s hand) I rashly said that I would occasionally write a page here & now V. calls on me to redeem my word, & as it will take me from reading Joseph Chamberlainâ€™s speeches, I dont see why I shouldnâ€™t. We went to the Webbs for luncheon & there too were Mr & Mrs Tawny. I had met her but not him. Before they came, the Webbs told us that he was an idealist. Now that Iâ€™ve met him the only thing which I can add with certainty is that he is an idealist with black teeth. One of the worst Webb meals to which we have been. V. between Webb & Tawny & I between Mrs W. Mrs T. Mrs W. began to talk almost at once about the Reconstruction Committee which she is on. She talked incessantly & every tenth word was â€œcommitteeâ€. She has apparently succeeded in inventing a committee for babies, a committee for lunatics, a committee for the sick, a committee for the disabled, & a committee for the dead; but the scheme or the Cosmos is not complete because she has so far failed to invent a Committee for the Able-bodied & unemployed. However she still has hopes. Meanwhile V. at one corner, & I at another sunk in silence, while Mrs T. vacuously asked W. about the case of a woman with a broken hip in an infirmary in a Union in Walthamstow. Immediately after luncheon we fled. Took a bus from Westminster to Hammersmith, very cold but refreshing after the discourse on committees.

& when we got back here we found the room full of peopleâ€”Rosalind Toynbee Arnold T. & Ka. I liked her, small, pale, with dark eyes, a wisp of hair, still, & decided in her manner. Iâ€™m not sure that I did much like him. He seemed rather more commonplace & conventional than the young man oneâ€™s used to. But we talked away briskly about art & literature; & I observed R.T. thinking, when spoken toâ€”a good sign. As far as one can see, she is so trained in culture that she is almost a specialist; if one got to know her, I mean, one would find some carefully arranged theory netting in all her feelings about literature. For example, she doesnâ€™t like King Lear. But, or perhaps therefore, I thought her rather distinguished, more so, at any rate than the crop-heads of Bloomsbury. As we sat, with great rolls of fur, in the shadow, I cant verify my guess as to the crop-head in her case. It struck me now & then that her half-aristocratic parentage had produced a kind of old fashioned decorum in her. Her views upon the proper relation of cooks & governesses were certainly decorous. Something I think may be due to the difference between Oxford & Cambridge. Itâ€™s strange to think how much oneâ€™s mind has been affected by this differenceâ€”even mine has, I suppose, though I was never there, & am by nature critical of them. But Arnold seemed to me not very easy to talk directly to.
