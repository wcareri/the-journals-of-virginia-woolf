### Tuesday 7 August

Queer misty day. Sun not strong enough to come through. Went to Brighton after lunch. German prisoners working in the field by Dod's Hill. laughing with the soldier, & woman passing. Went to Pier; tea at Booth's; horrible men at our table; staged at Lewes on way back. Bicycled back from Glynde. N. & L. went to get mushrooms, & found several also blackberries getting ripe, only have no sugar for jam.
