### Wednesday 17 October

I went up to the show of pictures at Healâ€™s this afternoon, L. having spent the morning at a Coop. conference. First I stood at Mudies counter while a stout widow chose 10 novels; taking them from the hand of Mudies man, like a lapdog, only stipulating that she wanted no vulgarity, not much description, but plenty of incident. Her companion recommended South Windâ€”much praised by the reviewsâ€”all clever conversation, Italy; â€œbut I canâ€™t bear conversationâ€”I like sensationâ€ said the widow & gulped down another mass of sweet sensation warranted not about the war, nor about drunkards. â€œI must really reduce my subscription to 8 I thinkâ€ she observed; & waddled off with her ten volumes to Woking, so I guessed.

Ottoline was not at her ease; closely buttoned up in black velvet, hat like a parasol, satin collar, pearls, tinted eyelids, & red gold hair. Needless to say one saw nothing of the pictures. Aldous Huxley was thereâ€”infinitely long & lean, with one opaque white eye. A nice youth. We walked up & down a gallery discussing his Aunt, Mrs Humphry Ward. The mystery of her character deepens; her charm & wit & character all marked as a woman, full of knowledge & humourâ€”& then her novels. These are partly explained by Arnold, who brought them near bankruptcy 4 years ago, & she rescued the whole lot by driving her pen day & night. We had tea with Roger. I was very much conscious of strainâ€”Ott. languid, & taking refuge in her great ladyhood, which is always depressing. They both seemed to have their quarrel before their eyes. I walked with her in the downpour to Oxford Street, she buying me crimson carnations, without cordiality.
