### Thursday 18 October

L. out until 5 at his conference: & the telephone rang constantly (so I thought, as I tried to pin Mrs Meynell down in a review). A dull life without him! Even Tinklerâ€™s restless mind did not make up. Oneâ€™s right hand becomes quite cramped holding his chain. Let loose he is very random, but on the whole obedient.* I had my tea in the kitchen, & L. came as I finished it; we sit surrounded by kittens & dogs, who now verge upon a suspicious relationship of some sort. We now expect Ka.

* This, I must say, applies to Tinker, not to L.
