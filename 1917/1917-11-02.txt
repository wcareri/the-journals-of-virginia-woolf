### Friday 2 November

It almost is â€œthis time next weekâ€; though not quiteâ€”in fact not nearly, since L. is giving a lecture at Birkenhead at this precise moment, & will then I suppose travel all night across England before reaching me. I find it impossible to read after a railway journey; I cant open Dante or think of him without a shudderâ€”the cause being I think partly the enormous numbers of newspapers Iâ€™ve been reading in. Lottie brought me all the Timesâ€™s which have accumulated. I feel as if Iâ€™d moved about a great deal; kept moving to keep myself warm. I mean Asheham & Charleston were rather in the nature of distractions, so as not to think how strange & solitary I was. Not solitary in the literal sense of course. First I spent 2 days with Saxon; much detail, rather heightened by his greater warmth of intimacy. He is still surprised by his own sensations; takes them out, sees how they fit in; very anxious to be sure of their quality. Of course the quality is very high. The worst one can say is that his lack of virility tends to prettify & belittle to some extent. But I daresay this is the effect of Bâ€™s not very marked or magnificent nature. And of course, too, heâ€™s exquisite in his own way; so pure, wise, good, & sensitive. Most curiously unable to cope with anything needing decision; his instinct is obviously always to avoid risk by remaining motionless. When forced to order coal or a cab his indecision is that of a spinster of 70. And yet intellectually he is definite enough; definite, but meticulous. Heâ€™s in love, & yet content that B. should marry Nick.

There was the new governess, Miss Edwards at Charleston; a very pretty, rather sharp, not very well bred or well educated young woman who has I should imagine lived on the capital of her large eyes, flaxen hair, straight dark eyebrows so much that she is a little out of it in an element where these attractions are discounted. There is no one to make eyes atâ€”save Bunny, who remains impervious. But she controls Julian; talks French evidently rather more naturally than English. I meant to ask her what she thinks in. Yesterday it rained all day, so I sat in; writing about Aksakoff in the morning; sitting in the Studio after luncheon. Duncan painted a table, & Nessa copied a Giotto. I unpacked all my bits of gossip. They are very large in effect, these painters; very little self-conscious; they have smooth broad spaces in their minds where I am all prickles & promontories. Nevertheless to my thinking few people have a more vigorous grasp or a more direct pounce than Nessa. Two little boys with very active minds keep her in exercise. I like the feeling that she gives of a whole nature in use. In working order I mean; living practically, not an amateur, as Duncan & Bunny both to some extent are of course. I suppose this is the effect of children & of responsibility, but I always remember it in her. A love of the actual fact, is strong in her. Julian came with his letter into my room this morning; & at once curled up on my bed, & went on reading a book with a picture of a Bird of Paradise in it. He told me he had read Gardinerâ€™s history perhaps 50 times. He disliked Kings because they were so dull; but liked Newcastle. Irish history bored him because it was shapeless, as far as I could make out; he couldnâ€™t see that either side was in the right about the American war, which annoyed him; & he thought if we had given way about the taxes we should have got our way without their knowing it, as we have done with our other colonies. Quentin called him to lessons, or he would have gone on at length. I was a good deal impressed. Suddenly to find a child reasoning & inheriting these old puzzles gives one rather a shock. It seems a pity there canâ€™t be a new history for each new generation; & yet its queer to hand over the old things to the new brains. I daresay heâ€™ll do a lot of work one of these days; is it a sign of age that oneâ€™s interested & inclined to see great virtue in the youngest generation?

But I was glad to come home, & feel my real life coming back againâ€”I mean life here with L. Solitary is not quite the right word; oneâ€™s personality seems to echo out across space, when heâ€™s not there to enclose all oneâ€™s vibrations. This is not very intelligibly written; but the feeling itself is a strange oneâ€”as if marriage were a completing of the instrument, & the sound of one alone penetrates as if it were a violin robbed of its orchestra or piano. A dull wet night, so I shall sleep. The raid happened of course, with us away.
