### Friday 19 October

The sweetness of Kaâ€™s nature, so we thought, is triumphing over the bureaucracy which threatened to straitwaistcoat all her charm. Not but what office life isnâ€™t a pool past which one has to lead her. She complains of falling hair; but looked to me softer & rosier, & more of the smoothness of cream than for a long while. She spent the night, was down with her leather case in hand to catch an early train. I had a letter from Nessa, about servants, & so went up to Mrs Hunts this afternoonâ€”a mysterious building, all glass compartments, leading to a space given up to the ironing & washing of pink & blue pinafores, or so it looked. Not a parlourmaid to be had. With some skilful manipulation of trains, I reached the Aeolian Hall, paid my shilling & heard a very long & very lovely Schubert octet. Coming out, I saw a grey, shockheaded woman without a hatâ€”Alix; & we had tea at Spikings. She has a kind of independence & lack of concern for appearances which I admire. But as we walked up & down Dover Street she seemed on the verge of rolling up the usual veil of laughter & gossip & revealing her sepulchral despairâ€”poor woman.

Where are you going now Alix?  
I really dont know.  
Well that sounds dismal! Dont you look forward to say eleven tomorrow morning?  
I merely wish it didnâ€™t exist thatâ€™s all!  
So I left her, hatless, aimless, unattached, wandering in Piccadilly.
