### Monday 13 August

Went into Lewes with Alix: she left us in the High St. L. had his leg looked at; probably a strain. Market in Lewes. Calves wrapped in sacking lying on platform. Walked back from Glynde. To get mushrooms before dinner; every grass almost had blues asleep on it. Found very few mushrooms, having seen the shepherd bring a bag down in the morning. Warned by Lottie that Will was going to blow up wasps nest after dinner, so we watched: much smell, explosion, wasps swarmed. This was done twice in nest near the hole in the wall.
