### Wednesday 15 August

Nessa, Mabel, & children came to tea. Our pink flower she says is phlox: not stocks. Went into hollow without success; but Nelly found more mushrooms on the top. The Co-ops will allow more sugar, so we can now make jam. Gunn charges 4d quart for milk. Duncan over for dinner. They walked home at 10 over the downs. Quentin ate till he was nearly sick at tea.
