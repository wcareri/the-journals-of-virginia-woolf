### Sunday 5 August

Dull morning, getting steadily finer, until it became a very hot & sunny afternoon. Walked on M.'s walk. Saw 3 perfect peacock butterflies, 1 silver washed frit[illary]; besides innumerable blues feeding on dung. All freshly out & swarming on the hill. Small flowers out in great quantities. Found mushrooms, mostly in the hollow, enough for a dish. Barbara & Bunny after dinner stayed for tea & dinner.
