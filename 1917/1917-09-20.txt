### Thursday 20 September

Another grey windy day, though not so much rain. Brilliant sun & blue sky for about 10 minutes in the afternoon. L. had to get whiskey in Rodmell. Picked apples, he on the table. Then to get milk at cottage, & round into hollow, where we found 3 mushrooms; & the spine & red legs of a bird, just devoured by a hawk either pigeon or partridge. Very windy, but a starry night.
