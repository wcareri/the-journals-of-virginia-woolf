### Wednesday 24 October

L. to some confounded meeting; but also to take our selected sample of paper to Mr Byles, whom he met coming out of the New Statesman office. I did a little printing, & then up to Janet. With time one would naturally welcome wet & wind; already the worst chill of them is over, because one thinks of them as safety against the raid. So today I hardly grumbled, though it was heavy rain, cold, dark, inhuman, primeval weather. The Case mÃ©nage is extremely cheerful to step into; such a welcome, such anxiety about China tea or Indian, an egg, fresh bread & butterâ€”clothes dried with a duster. Emphie spirited, discursive, inconsecutive as usual, about her day & her Ecko (? a hearing aid), & servants, & sugar & honey, all fresh & sensible, & evidently the fruit of experience, which has not embittered or aged her, though it has not given her much power of concentration. She went to write her notes, after tea (this is her great occupation) Janet & I talked, getting on well as usual. But I was packed off to wait 15 minutes at Finchley Road, lest I should miss my train; & travelled with a mother & three boys who made all the elderly gentlemen shy & yet cordial to watch their kisses & antics from behind their newspapers.
