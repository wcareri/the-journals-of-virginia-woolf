### Wednesday 19 September

Telegram to put off picnic. Day looked very bad, rained & blew all the afternoon. Walked with D. to Rodmell to ask about whiskey. Public House shut up; man came & cd. sell us none till 6. Stayed talking about the war ''Whats it for?'' & how soldiers wd. break the windows if they came home & found no beer. Met German prisoners on the road. D. said Guten Tag, & they all answered. Sentry said nothing. Real winter now.
