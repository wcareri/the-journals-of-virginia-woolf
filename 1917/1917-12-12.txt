### Wednesday 12 December

This morning ruined by the tears & plaints of Lottie, who thinks her work too hard, & finally demanded higher wages, which she could easily get, & so could Nell. I lost my temper, & told her to get them then. Up came Nelly in a conciliatory mood regretting Lottieâ€™s outburst; though pointing out the hardships of our printing-room, so untidyâ€”work endless; had meant to ask a rise in Februaryâ€”everyoneâ€™s wages raisedâ€”Of course we had to pay extra for food, but then weâ€™d got toâ€”We were very amicable; no difficulty about money; but L.â€™s taunts seemed to me unpleasantâ€”I charged her to find out the truthâ€”if there is such a thing in the midst of that blusterâ€”At last she went. Walked by the river having done a little printing.
