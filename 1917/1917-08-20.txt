### Monday 20 August

To Firle after tea over the down. The thistledown has been blowing about these last few days. Shepherd says mushrooms come from a fortnight & go for a fortnight. Very fine still, always S.E. wind, rather high. Home by the fields. A great deal of the corn has to be cut by hand. Men still working & women too at 7.
