### Saturday 15 September

A perfect day for our treat. We went to Eastbourne. Sat in Devonshire park & watched tennis & heard band. Saw an aeroplane in field near Glynde. It looked like a toy. Children round it: man working propeller round. Had tea & ice; bought Kodak; home to Lewes, where we bought stuff &c. Lord Hugh Cecil got out of the train at Glynde, with a guardsman &c; very amusing to watch: he had 3 leather bags; dressed as flying officer; quite white haired.
