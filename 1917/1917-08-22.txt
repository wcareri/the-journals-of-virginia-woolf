### Wednesday 22 August

L. up to London again to see man from the foreign office. Very hot & windy again. Thistledown blowing across the house & over the field very thick. K.M. went after lunch, in the fly from the Ram, which took Lyttonâ€™s bag also. Two moving machines, with 3 horses each, cutting the corn in the field across the road. Cutting round & round: finished last path about 5. Corn already cut & standing on the fields across the river. Eating potatoes from the garden. There was a raid today. Ramsgate.
