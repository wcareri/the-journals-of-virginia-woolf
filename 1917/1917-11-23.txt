### Friday 23 November

L. went up to London with the rollers, & I meant to go to Kew. On the way it struck me that one ought to decide things definitely. One ought to make up oneâ€™s mind. To begin then, I settled that if it was the 6d day at Kew I wouldnâ€™t hesitate but decide not to go in. It was the 6d day; I turned without pausing & had therefore to walk back. Certainly this decision brings a feeling of peace, though I rather think I was wrong. It was a warm, windless day, the sky genuinely blue. I counted my lumps of sugar, 31: but Saxon came in, & took one; hadnâ€™t slept, & so was cutting his office. I meant to read Brookeâ€™s sermons, & couldnâ€™t; & Saxon hadnâ€™t much to say. We discussed the jealousy of vanity & the jealousy of affection. He is immune from both. I have the one & not the otherâ€”perhaps from lack of cause. L. came in after seeing Squire, whose insignificance takes the lustre from reviewing rather. Then came Barbara, who wanted a bath; & Saxon followed her; & then Clive came in, & we chattered awayâ€”he & I in duet for the most partâ€”till 10.30; when he went dressed like a Newmarket gent in an immensely thick coat. I find his sprightliness a rest. No hunt for subjects needed. He is after another before the first is disposed of. He abused Ott., but frankly. He discussed Lady Mary Montagu: his reviewsâ€”a publisher has offered him Â£40 for a book of them. He has become rather a raconteur; but there is, I think, something intellectual about him; something of the Cambridge standard, perhaps, surviving. Heâ€™s no fool, though his manners suggest overwhelming reasons for thinking him one now & thenâ€”this perpetual effort to shine, to be â€˜in the knowâ€™â€”this vanity. A long talk with M.H. on the telephone interrupted him. He has become a great writer of intimate letters He makes a business of knowing everyone, or at any rate their affairs; but I like this.
