### Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, & Wednesday;  
Wednesday being the 12th of December

A melancholy recordâ€”The truth is, when weâ€™re not printing & therefore donâ€™t have Barbara here, we do jobs in London, & get back late & Iâ€™m disinclined to get out pen & ink. On Sunday Lytton came to tea. I was alone, for L. went to Margaret. I enjoyed it very much. He is one of the most supple of our friends; I donâ€™t mean passionate or masterful or original, but the person whose mind seems softest to impressions, least starched by any formality or impediment. There is his great gift of expression of course, never (to me) at its best in writing; but making him in some respects the most sympathetic & understanding friend to talk to. Moreover, he has become, or now shows it more fully, curiously gentle, sweet tempered, considerate; & if one adds his peculiar flavour of mind, his wit & infinite intelligenceâ€”not brain but intelligenceâ€”he is a figure not to be replaced by any other combination. Intimacy seems to me possible with him as with scarcely any one; for, besides tastes in common, I like & think I understand his feelingsâ€”even in their more capricious developments; for example in the matter of Carrington. He spoke of her, by the way, with a candour not flattering, though not at all malicious.

â€œThat woman will dog meâ€â€”he remarked. â€œShe wonâ€™t let me write, I daresay.â€  
â€œOttoline was saying you would end by marrying her.â€  
â€œGod! the mere notion is enoughâ€”One thing I knowâ€”Iâ€™ll never marry anyoneâ€”â€  
â€œBut if sheâ€™s in love with you?â€  
â€œWell, then she must take her chance.â€  
â€œI believe Iâ€™m sometimes jealousâ€”â€  
â€œOf her? thats inconceivableâ€”â€  
â€œYou like me better, dont you?â€

He said he did; we laughed; remarked on our wish for an intimate correspondent; but how to overcome the difficulties? Should we attempt it? Perhaps.

He brought us his Gordon. Next day he was to take the book to Chatto & Windus.
