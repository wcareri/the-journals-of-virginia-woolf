### Friday 14 December

Today we went to see Philip at Fishmongers Hall. Rather a strange place a few feet from London Bridge. A pompous hall, with a porter, a gigantic fire for that porter, a German gun; & within banisters draped with crimson folds of stuff, as if for a royal visit; Nelsonâ€™s flag in a glass case; Dick Whittington in plaster standing in an alcove; a branching staircase taking one to a great gallery now divided into cubicles. Two or three nurses sat sewing outside. We found Philip up; his chair by the open window, looking into the street, which was noisy, & just catching sight of the river. I saw a notice warning patients not to throw cigarette ends out, or they might catch inflammable bales upon the wharf. To me, Philip looked well; though there was that absentmindedness which one sees in Nick. I suppose to Philip these days pass in a dream from which he finds himself detached. I can imagine that he is puzzled why he doesnâ€™t feel more. He still talks of â€œweâ€ & â€œourâ€ things. I thought he must look to going back again with something like hope. But he talked very easily & cheerfullyâ€”about horses & books & so onâ€”Another manâ€”a great burly cavalry officer was reading his book in a far corner; unused to reading books, I should think. Nurses seemed very kindly. A feeling of the uselessness of it all, breaking these people & mending them again, was in the air, I thought. We asked Philip to Asheham, when he can move.

Home to find Sidney (Waterlow) already in the chair by the fire. He was in very good feather, & rolled out the word â€œIâ€ with a sort of tremor of pride; he has indeed negotiated treaties in Paris since we met. Being self conscious & diffident his triumphs give him enormous pleasure; there is the same tremor of half incredulous self approbation in his tone when he talks of his children. I laughed at him about our quarrel. He had thought it all over, so he saidâ€”as if it mattered; & was highly pleased by the removal of the cloud. Saxon came, very late, to dinner. I gave it him, & he told me how selfish Alix wasâ€”canâ€™t pack her own boxes; waits for Carrington. Saxon attributes this to love; I believe its in imitation of the beloved. She has picked it up from James, sees it in him & thinks it stands for the consciousness of superiority, I believe. Sydney stayed the night; & Saxon stayed till eleven; & he only spoke 3 times; & then rather pedantically, in his old way, which he has rather dropped lately.
