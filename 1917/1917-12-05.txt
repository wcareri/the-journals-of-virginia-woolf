### Wednesday 5 December

Our apprentice weighs rather heavily upon us. For one thing, though Iâ€™m always ashamed in her presence to feel this, her presence is rather in the way of our complete comfort. It may be her youth; something highly polished so as to reflect without depth about herâ€”On the other hand, sheâ€™s nice, considerate; one can be open with her. The real drawback is her work. Today has been spent by L. in the futile misery of trying to print from one of her pages which wont lock up. As the other page had to be entirely taken down & re-set, her work amounts to nil; less than nil, considering L.â€™s time wasted. A bitter cold day too. Our only outing after dark to the printers to borrow inverted commaâ€™s. Yesterday L. saw Philip at Fishmongerâ€™s Hall. I set up in one room, Barbara in the other. These days indoors donâ€™t provide much in the way of incident, & pass with the swiftest rush, so that at 9 oâ€™clock, the present hour, one seems only starting on the days workâ€”perhaps the result of passing without question straight from one occupation to another. L. reading Life of Dilke; worried by a flea up his back; Iâ€™m past the middle of Purgatorio, but find it stiff, the meaning more than the language, I think. We got Hardyâ€™s new poems, but lent them to Philip.
