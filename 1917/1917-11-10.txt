### Saturday 10 November

Another melancholy fact is that Iâ€™ve let all these days passâ€”two of them, Wednesday & Thursday because I was out late, the third Friday because I was too gloomy, & we were both too argumentative, to make writing possible. However, to deal with the dissipations first, though I dont admit they were the cause of the gloom. Nessa was up, & I had a Bloomsbury afternoon. First I took my watch to a man in Poland Street, who says it needs cleaning only, then I went to the Omega where in the semidark Roger was convoying three chattering Frenchwomen round the show, & giving the impression as usual that French manners & language have a peculiar relish for him. The pictures glimmered through the dusk; & I was chiefly impressed by the Gertlers; Vanessa, too, very good: Duncan, I thought, a little pretty or tending to be. Faith vacillated about, endeavouring to make me see her show of dresses, this being private view day. We had tea in the sewing roomâ€”walking up & down munching dry cake, while Mabel stitched lining in a corner, & Roger wrote letters on his knee. Nessa came on top of this & we left, I buying an apricot coloured coat on my way. I had tea in Gordon Square, which always puzzles me under the new arrangement, there being no sitting room. She is brooding some new educational schemeâ€”6 boys, a tutor & a governess; has planned it all for next summer. Miss Edwards has taken to meeting soldiers on the downs, & her capacity wonâ€™t last long. This was the prelude to a party (at 46 Gordon Square) on Thursday, to which I went, through the wet & the dirt, a very long expedition for 2 hours of life, though I enjoyed it. The usual people were there, the usual sensation of being in a familiar but stimulating atmosphere, in which all the people oneâ€™s in the habit of thinking of, were there in the body. A great many mop headed young women in amber & emerald sitting on the floor. Molly, Vanessa & I represented mature matronhood. Oliver seemed to be the friendly & amorous Uncle. Ray one might call the grandmother; very commanding, immensely well nourished, & competent. I spent most of my time with Oliver, & as the clock struck 10 I got up and wentâ€”an example of virtue if ever there was one. And now we see how the gloom came about. L. was testy, dispiriting, & tepid. We slept. I woke to a sense of failure & hard treatment. This persisted, one wave breaking after another, all day long. We walked on the river bank in a cold wind, under a grey sky. Both agreed that life seen without illusion is a ghastly affair. Illusions wouldnâ€™t come back. However they returned about 8.30, in front of the fire, & were going merrily till bedtime, when some antics ended the day.

Today has been very cheerful, in spite of the worst assortment of elements to be had; bitter cold, stormy sky, rain. L. went to the Lost Dogs Home, but without success; we have put up notices, but hope runs low. Iâ€™ve been without letters for 2 days.
