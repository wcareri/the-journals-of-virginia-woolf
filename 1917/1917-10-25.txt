### Thursday 25 October

Owing to the usual circumstances, I had to spend the day recumbent. However this is much mitigated by printing, which I do from my bed on the sloping table. We took off a proof of 2 pages, on paper of the right size & liked the looks of it immensely. Our paper will be soft & yellow tinted. A melancholy letter from Ott. this morning, complaining of age & ugliness, the weariness of London & the sadness of not being wantedâ€”all so true, I suppose, that we have accepted an invitation, on my part rather out of pity; though also a feeling of liking for her persists. Saxon & Barbara dined with us; we are lending Asheham to the whole of that curious constellationâ€”Nick & Saxon will revolve round Barbara; who twinkles rosily but modestly in the light of their admiration; very neat, nice, motherly. Saxon as usual when with herâ€”gentle & giving off a sound as of a boiling, but not over boiling, kettle; speechless of course. As she has only simple direct things to say, L. & I were a little sleepy; but we have arranged that she is to take up printing when Nick goes back (to France). I am going to Asheham on Monday with Saxon.
