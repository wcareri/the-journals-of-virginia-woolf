### Sunday 28 October

Still no raids, presumably the haze at evening keeps them off, though it is still, & the moon perfectly clear. The numbers who have gone out of London this week must feel a little foolish. A perfect cold October day; sun red through the leaves which are still hanging. In order to keep as much in L.â€™s company as I could, I determined to go to Staines with him. We walked from Shepperton through Laleham, & so to Staines by the river. Flat very quiet country, or country just turning into town. Pink arm chairs were drawn up round a crowded but not luxurious tea table; a multiplicity of little plates, minute knives, people told to help themselves. Mr Lock, with some impediment was there, & soon Alice, Flora, Clara & Sylvia all appearedâ€”malice suggested the whole of Kensington High Street poured into a room. The normality of it all impressed me. Nothing beautiful; nothing definite; most strange why nature has produced this type in such abundance. Then, the servant said â€œMr Sturgeonâ€; Flora cried â€œI will goâ€ dashed from the room; everyone said Oh! Ah! How Splendid!, as if on the stage, which indeed the whole scene might have been. We went, after the 2nd act; Tinker dashed off; but was recovered, & so home, very cold, & Herbert looked in, & here we sit over the fire, & I wish it were this time next week.
