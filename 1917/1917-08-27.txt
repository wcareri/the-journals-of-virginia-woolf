### Monday 27 August

We had meant to go to Eastbourne, to get my watch mended, among other things, but about 12 it not only blew very hard but rained. The field full of swallows, & leaves broken off in bunches, so that the trees already look thin. L. thinks that the swallows are driven into the hollow by the gale, in hopes that fly's may be out in the shelter. Swallows & leaves whirling about look much the same. L. took ms. to catch London train at Glynde: then we walked by M.'s walk on to the down; got some blackberries: the bushes laden with them; & a few mushrooms. Such wind & rain however that we were wet through & had to come home. Lit wood fire after tea. We have had them after dinner, but not yet after tea. Rained steadily; water came through the garden door.
