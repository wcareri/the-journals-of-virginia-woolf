### Wednesday 12Â September

I bicycled to Charleston, getting there at 12:30 A long & rather dull bit of road between Glynde & Charleston - but going slowly it is easy to do it in under the hour. L. came after tea & we bicycled back the other way by Beanstalk lane, discovered a probable short cut. Gigantic sun; colder, & windier than before. Corn in field opposite carried about now.
