### Sunday 21 October

Lytton came to luncheon, & Goldie to dinnerâ€”so we must have talked for 6 or 7 hours. We walked down the river & through the Park. Lytton in good spirits, having finished a book of 100,000 words, though now pretending that it canâ€™t be published. He means to leave London, & live â€œfor everâ€ in the country. At this moment Saxon & Oliver are inspecting houses in Berkshire. It seems a good thing that oneâ€™s friends should try experiments. Poor old Goldie is evidently beyond that stage. If I were malicious I should say he had reached the stage of the complete conversationalist. A long story at dinner, very skillfully told; suited to keep the High Table amused; then facts with Leonard after dinner. One finds less power of detachment in the elderly. This war seems to possess him, to leave little over. In fact he looked shrunk & worn: infinitely good, charming, devoted, every ounce of vitality rightly appliedâ€”no time for experiments, not enough curiosity perhaps, though extreme kindliness & sympathy, which in the case of young men, becomes amorous. He has been asked to go to Russia for The Manchester Guardian; but doubts if he will get a passport.
