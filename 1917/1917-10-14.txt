### Sunday 14 October

That is an awful confession, & seems to show the signs of death already spreading in this book. I have excuses though. We were rung up & asked to dine with the Bells in Soho, & this, I regret to say, led to much argument; we put off going to Kingston; the night was wet, & L. didnâ€™t wantâ€”old arguments in short were brought out, with an edge to them. So we went dolefully enough, found the place, behind the palace, dined with Roger, Nina Hamnet, Saxon & Barbara & a party such as might figure in a Wells novel: I enjoyed it though, & L. was a model of self-control. Cliveâ€™s remarks tended to prove that he is at the centre of everything, but not so aggressive as usual. Nessa has found her governessâ€”sent, apparently by the hand of God. Then on Saturdayâ€”what happened? Saturday was entirely given over to the military. We are safe again, &, so they say for ever. Our appearance smoothed every obstacle; & by walking across Kingston we got to the doctor about 12, & all was over by half past. I waited in a great square, surrounded by barrack buildings, & was reminded of a Cambridge collegeâ€”soldiers crossing, coming out of staircases, & going into others; but gravel & no grass. A disagreeable impression of control & senseless determination. A great boarhound, emblem of military dignity I suppose, strolled across by himself. L. was a good deal insulted: the drs. referred to him as â€œthe chap with senile tremorâ€, through a curtain. Mercifully the impression slowly vanished as we went about Richmond. Herbert came to tea, bringing the dog, Tinker, a stout, active, bold brute, brown & white, with large luminous eyes, reminding me a little of Dominic Spring-Rice. We have taken him for a walk, but directly he is loosed, he leaps walls, dashes into open doors, & behaves like a spirit in quest of something not to be found. We doubt rather if we can cope with him. Have I put down our Manx cat, also presented to us, one day this week? L. is up at Hampstead. We are to have Alix & Lilian (Harris) to dinner.
