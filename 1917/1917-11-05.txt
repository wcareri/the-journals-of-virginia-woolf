### Saturday 3, Sunday 4, Monday 5 November

The raid didnâ€™t actually happen but with our nerves in the state they are (I should say Lottieâ€™s & Nellyâ€™s nerves) the dipping down of the electric lights was taken as a sign of warning: finally the lights went out, & standing on the kitchen stairs I was deluged with certain knowledge that the extinction of light is in future our warning. I looked out of the hall door, however, heard the usual patter & voices of suburbans coming home; & then, to bear out my assurance, the lights suddenly came on again. We went to bed & to sleep. I woke 5 minutes before 7, & lay listening, but heard nothing, & was about, at 8 oâ€™clock to flatten out all my expectations when I heard L. at the door & there he was! With the softness of a mouse he had let himself in & breakfasted. We talked for as long as we could; things kept oozing out; sudden silences & spurts; divine contentment at being once more harmonious. L. travelled all night. The most pungent of his tales is to me the story of the arguing & enquiring & experimenting. Mrs Ekhard who thrust herself into all sorts of subjects, with L., while he cut down her trees. The palms of his hands are still black from the soot of Manchester bark. We walked by the river, & to bed rather early. L. having denied that he was at all tired, tumbled asleep & slept till he was called.

On Sunday I finished my Aksakoff, & writing has the advantage of making a weekday out of the Sabbath, in spite of the clamour & blare of military music & church bells which always takes place at about 11â€”a noise which the other people have no right to inflict. We went up the river & through the Park, for it was a lovely warm day; & passed our Walter again with a man who looked like a schoolmaster. No deer are to be seen in the lower park, where the cedars are. And Perera came to tea, & I shut him alone with L. having no wish for more yards of lace. I think, however, that L. is now menaced with a gold watch, owing to the success of the Ceylon business. The Daily News bursts out in three separate places in indignation.

And today weâ€™ve been to London, & just come back, & sit waiting for dinner. Expecting life & smartness at least I spent 8d upon a Magazine with Mrs Asquithâ€™s love letters, & theyâ€™re as flat & feeble & vulgar & illiterate as a provincial Mrs Glyn might be; with something insolent about them, as though she condescended in scribblingâ€” We went to the London Library, as usual; coming out ran in to the hatless dusky figure, L.â€™s dame secretaire: Alix; on her way to grope for facts, which L.â€™s eye finds a good deal quicker. We saw the hole in Piccadilly almost mended, though the glass is still broken. L. to Williams & Norgate about his book, which kept him so long that I had time to despise Mrs A. pretty thoroughly in Cliffordâ€™s Inn tea rooms. The talk was heated; L. accused of low dealing in offering his book to Bell. (Margaretâ€™s doing). Some arrangement may be come to; but the man an incompetent & stupid creature, who wont give way, & will have his rights. Hanging on a strap in the Tube was Malcolm Macnaghten; grey, spruce & prosperous looking.
