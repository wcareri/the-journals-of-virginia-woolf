### Thursday 15 November

Again a day of no letters, unless I can count my weekly reprimand in the Supt. for what I said or didnâ€™t say about Arnoldâ€™s poems about nature. This time Iâ€™m almost inclined to answer useless though it is, but I should like to protest against this flood of Oxford superiority. We printed off another page, very successfully, which took till tea time, & then we went round in the semi-darkness to the little printer, who will come round any moment now to see the room for the press. One little boy about the size of Julian works for him. Yesterday his cellar was flooded by the ladies bath next door. He is very precise in his language: perhaps the result of a semi-literary profession.
