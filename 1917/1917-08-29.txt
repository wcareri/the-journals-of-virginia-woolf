### Wednesday 29 August

Another very bad day, though wind less furious. Swallows flying higher. Papers say storm has been all over England. Tremendous rain in the afternoon; which stopped, & we went to post at Southease, arguing about education, back over the hill; a fine evening - great sun appeared as we dined, & sunset for the first time since Saturday.
