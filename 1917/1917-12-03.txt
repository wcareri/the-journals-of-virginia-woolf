### Monday 3 December

Its impossible to remember a week at a stretch, which I must confess would be my task if I were to pretend to be accurate. One day I went to the dentist; & we had Barbara here for 3 days, with disastrous results, for when we looked at her work, it was so full of faults we had to take it down. I should have expected, not much intelligence, but the quickness & accuracy of a good needlewoman. This was annoying. On Saturday L. gave a lecture at Hampstead. Strange what a stamp Hampstead sets even on a casual gathering of 30 people; such clean, decorous, uncompromising & high minded old ladies & old gentlemen; & the young wearing brown clothes, & thinking seriously, the women dowdy, the men narrow shouldered; bright fire & lights & books surrounding us, & everyone of course agreeing beforehand to what was said. Old Dr Clark indeed could quote clauses in Treaties by their numbers; & Hobson was shrewd, judicious & kindly; Janet came in looking very well. But we had to race off in the Tube to Leicester Sqre to dine with Barbara Saxon & a young woman called G. Then on to Figaro at the Old Vic. Itâ€™s perfectly lovely; breaking from one beauty into another, & so romantic as well as wittyâ€”the perfection of music, & vindication of opera.

On Sunday we heard of Cecilâ€™s death, & Philipâ€™s wounds. We walked along the river in the afternoon, when L. came back from Staines, & came to an old hollow elm tree, in the sawdust of which someone so we guessed, had stuck a match. The wind was blowing in, & soon the flames were running high. A crowd stopped. The first old gentleman was so positive that I believed him; he said it was a usual process, done to get rid of an old tree; nothing to marvel at; no question of accident or malice; & so he marched on with obvious contentment. The second old gentleman admitted doubts, finally swung round to our view that no one would burn a tree down on the public path on a Sunday too. Meanwhile the tree burnt rather beautifully; we called at the police office & told them, in case the fire might run along by means of bushes to other trees. Leonardâ€™s cold very badâ€”a horrid nuisance.

Today he stayed in & set up 21 lines. I went to Harrison, to Mudies, to the Times, with an article on Mrs Drew, & am just come in. Frostily cold night; stars polished to their brightest: so much brighter than the streets are. I lost my way again, & as no one knows where Printing House Sqre is, one has full scope for wandering in. I got the 2nd vol. of Ld Morleyâ€™s memories, a real solid book, I think, like the books father used to buy, looking like them too, an ugly red. One night Walter Lamb dropped in, as we sat over the fire; & his proud crest is a little dashed I think by my overpowering snobbery.
