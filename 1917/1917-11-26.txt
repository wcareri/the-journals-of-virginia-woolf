### Monday 26 November

I dont like Sunday; the best thing is to make it a work day, & to unravel Brookeâ€™s mind to the sound of church bells was suitable enough. Such a wind in the night, by the way, that the milkman reported much damage down the road this morning, & raised our hopes, which were dashed on going out to see nothing smashedâ€”not a stain of blood, or even the remnant of a hat. It was fine & wet by turns, with a high cold wind continuously. We went to Kew, & saw a blazing bush, as red as cherry blossom, but more intenseâ€”frostily redâ€”also gulls rising & falling for pieces of meat, their crowd waved aside suddenly by three very elegant light grey cranes. We also went into the orchid house where these sinister reptiles live in a tropical heat, so that they come out in all their spotted & streaked flesh even now in the cold. They always make me anxious to bring them into a novel. L. went on to Hampstead, & I back here; where I had tea in the kitchen with the Manx cat. L. saw Margaret & discussed labour I suppose. & his book. I wish my range extended so far.

Today I went into London with my ms: & Leonard went to Harrisons. (which entry was broken off somehowâ€”but my recollection is that L. found Desmond at the L.L.: together they look up the word fâ€”â€”in the slang dictionary, & were saddened & surprised to see how the thumb marks of members were thick on the page. My afternoon was by comparison chaste; though Iâ€™m hardly proud of the fact that I completely lost my way in seeking Printing House Square, & got into a maze of little half lit, very busy & professional looking streets which I should like to investigate. The profession of journalism has its heart here; carts were standing lengthwise for bales to be dumped into. A kind man in uniform, something at a warehouse he told me, took me to the Times at last; though I (still managed to miss my way, I think it must have been, for I remember walking rapidly in the wrong direction, which got darker & darker until I became suspicious & went back againâ€”but this is a week old).
