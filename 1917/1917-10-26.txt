### Friday 26 October

Either it is cold or wet or windy at night, so we sleep well, though the moon is now almost full. We are faced with the problem of providing for Tinker. His spirits make him an exacting guest. We went to find a home with the Vet. today, & discovered that a Vet. lives in part of the great red house at the back of us. We looked into a room, laid for tea, the tablecloth laid like a diamond across the table; a girl came; & I saw a black & white paved hall, evidently a fine house, now cut up into different bits. Nelly has just come back: the usual laughter begins again. We gave Lottie 5/ for doing so well.
