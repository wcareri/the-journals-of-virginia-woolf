### Thursday 23 August

Glad to be alone. L.'s leg cured now. Lottie sick from eating plums at Charleston. We walked along the top, finding a few mushrooms, & down the next hollow, in hopes of some, but found none. Odd that they should stick to Asheham. Mist & rain; but on the whole fine, wind very high Heather growing on the top, making it look purple: never seen it there before.
