### Tuesday 13 November

I must again register my complaint that people wont write to me. I dont write to them, but how can one? And no book from the Times either, for which Iâ€™m glad though, as I want to get on with my novel. The other day L. began his book, & has already done two chapters. Heâ€™s like one of those mowing machines I used to watch from my window at Asheham; round & round they go, without haste without rest, until finally the little square of corn in the middle is cut, & all is done. We began our printing off this afternoon. Our first discovery was the important one that the springs arenâ€™t even, or the balls different in weight. Weâ€”or L.â€”put this more or less right, & we printed 300 copies of the first page, but we should be glad of another press, though the results are very good for the most part. A very cold day. Indeed, I might have remarked the beginning of winter. No leaves to speak of left on the trees now; a sharp chill in the air. Oneâ€™s room after tea most emphatically a little centre of light in the midst of profound darkness. L. is making up a lecture heâ€™s giving at Hammersmith; Iâ€™m to preside over the Womenâ€™s Guild.
