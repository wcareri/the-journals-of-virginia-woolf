### Saturday 29 September

L. came over at 3:30. Morning very lovely - seems settled into perfect weather now. Took a great many photographs. Aeroplanes over the house early, which may mean another raid. Nights bright moonlight. Home bicycling across the fields all the way - more than a mile shorter than the other way. Great red sun sinking about 6. L. says the rooks came & picked walnuts off the tree this morning - saw one flying with walnut in his beak. Has planted the Japanese anemones etc. in the front beds, on the terrace & in the back garden. We mean to abolish the large round bed.
