### Friday 17 August

All these days have been very fine, hot, blue sky, rather a high wind. Same again today. L.S. wrote on the terrace in the morning. G.L.D. & L. played chess there in the afternoon. G.L.D. decided to go to Guildford, so we walked to Beddingham with him. L.'s foot better, but got worse with walking. Found no mushrooms; we suppose the rain brought them prematurely. No yeast, so had to eat Bakers bread, wh. is very dull & dry.
