### Thursday 4 October

Our last day a thoroughly bad one from the point of view of weather. Wind & rain; completely black sky. L. had to go, walking there & back, to Lewes to order our car for tomorrow. I went round M.'s walk for the last time. Rain stopped, but wind so tremendous that Nessa & Duncan wouldn't be able to come as arranged. Mushroom season evidently setting in. Found several on the top. Had to lean against the wind coming down. Great fall of walnuts. Men throwing sticks to bring them down. Couldn't work at the path. A fine starry night however.
