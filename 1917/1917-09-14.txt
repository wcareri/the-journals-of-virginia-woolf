### Friday 14 September

Meant to go to Lewes, as it became fine, but my bicycle found punctured; very annoying; but it was hopeless to start, so Nelly went instead on Mrs Hammond's, & got us a lot of things. Very hot & fine by degrees; seems to take a lot of time to get really fine. We went after mushrooms but found none- A most disappointing season. Cut up a great fungus like cheese.
