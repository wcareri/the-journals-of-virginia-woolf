### Thursday 13 December

By careful arrangement I limited the reconciliation scene with Lottie to 15 minutes at eleven sharp. She sobbed; repented; took back everything sheâ€™d said; told me how her temper had led to constant rows at â€œFrysâ€ as they call it; all a fabrication about over work, & the more people we had & the more mess we made the better she liked it. She begged me not to tell anyone; she kissed me & went off, like a chastened child, leaving me with a mixture of pity & (I suppose) self complacency. The poor have no chance; no manners or self control to protect themselves with; we have a monopoly of all the generous feelingsâ€”(I daresay this isnâ€™t quite true; but thereâ€™s some meaning (in) it. Poverty degrades, as Gissing said). Barbara had a cold & didnâ€™t come, to my relief certainly. But thatâ€™s inaccurate; she came after luncheon, & brought a letter from Nessa who invites her to be governess there for a month, pending Mrs Brereton. Barbara was so sensible, & matter of fact that I repented & certainly she treats us with the strictest honesty, making a serious undertaking of the printing (here the light went out) which is creditable, & one could depend upon her, I fancy, to keep the exact letter of her promise. She went off directly after tea to conduct one of those curious gatherings of Nick, Oliver, & Saxon & Carrington about their house in the country. The work of furnishing has fallen of course upon Carrington; but Barbara is a good second & keeps the accounts, which will end, I assured her, by absorbing all her money on things sheâ€™ll never be paid for.
