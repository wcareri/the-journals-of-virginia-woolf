### Friday 31 August

Last day of August a very beautiful one. Wind soft, & steadily grew finer & hotter so that we sat out on the terrace after tea. L. cut grass again, & I went in the water-meadows & so round onto the road, up the down, creeping behind old Bosanquet. I saw a herd of cows on the top of the down driven by a soldier & a man on a large black horse. Very odd sight. The mushroom seems to be extinct. After dinner, it still being light & hot, we took the wasps nest, burning it thoroughly, though when we left it, wasps were swarming at the mouth. Great question about Mrs Wooler's chicken; offers it for 2/6. Eggs now gone up to 3/- the dozen. Sausages here come in.
