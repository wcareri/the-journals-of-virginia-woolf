### Monday 10 December

Today was a string of meetings for L. Out to lunch, to Philip, to another meeting & not back till 8.30; I pacing the room in some anxiety till I heard him. My afternoon was very nearly normal; to Mudies, tea in an A.B.C. reading a life of Gaudier Brzeska; home again; wet soft vaporous day.
