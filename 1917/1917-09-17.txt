### Monday 17 September

Servants went in float, driven by Will, at 10: Mrs Hammond carne. Time changed at 3 to winter time. A windy changeable day. Telegram from MacCs' after lunch. Molly cant come; D. comes tomorrow. Went to post at Southease & back the usual way over the downs, talking about arctic regions. Rainy. Made chair cover after tea. A very dark evening, by new time.
