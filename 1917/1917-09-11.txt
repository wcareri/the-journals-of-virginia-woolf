### Tuesday 11 September

Went over the downs by the farm; saw 2 clouded yellows by the warren, & another pair over towards Bishopstone. Heard guns & saw two airships maneuvring over the sea & valley. Found Lady's Tresses, & Field Gentian on the Downs. Very hot day, but cold in the evening, & so had fire. Swallows have quite left the field. Pernel left. L. found a walnut sprouting with leaves & planted it in the garden.
