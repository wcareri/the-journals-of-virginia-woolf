### Monday 6 August

Very fine hot day. (Bank Holiday). Sound of band in Lewes from the Downs. Guns hears at intervals. Walked up the down at the back. Got plenty of mushtooms. Butterflies in quantities. Ladies Bedstraw, Round-headed Rampion, Thyme, Marjoram. Saw a grey looking hawk â€“ not the usual red-brown one. A few plums on the tree. We have begun to cook apples. Eggs 2/9 doz. From Mrs Attfield.
