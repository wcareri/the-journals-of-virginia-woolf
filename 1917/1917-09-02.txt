### Sunday 2 September

Uncertain, windy weather, with showers in the morning; but the sun seemed to get the better steadily, & it was a fine afternoon. Round M.'s walk, in a high wind, with the visitors. Hawks out, but saw nothing else. A superb evening, hot on the terrace & light over the downs till past 9. A fine September predicted. According to the papers, in most parts every day in Aug. had rain - one of the worst on record; so we have been in luck. H.W. & M.A. went after tea.
