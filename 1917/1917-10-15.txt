The chief fact today I think is the development & discovery of Tinkerâ€™s characterâ€”all in the right direction. He was taken a long walk by the river the avenue & the Park; his spirit is great, but almost under control. He fell into the river twice; jumped out again; circled madly with a black poodle, & investigated several garden gates, which seem to have a fascination for him. He is a human dog, aloof from other dogs. Alix & Lilian were much as usual last night, save that Lilian had a dark patch on the top of her head, & heard almost perfectly; the dark patch is a cup for catching sound. A more modest, amiable, & yet quietly well informed & resolute character does not exist. Her principles are invariably liberal, although her character is naturally conservativeâ€”rather a good mixture. Moreover, she has always depended on her brain, & thus discusses with great sense any question, so long as it isnâ€™t art, that comes up. Alix has the same air of level headed desperation, solid, capacious, but as low in tone as a coal cellar. However we found her very anxious to take on our work; & comes to learn tomorrow. Manx is sitting on L.â€™s knee; Tinker occasionally looks at him.
