### Monday 19 November

The little printer came round at the end of the last page, & stayed perhaps 1 hourâ€”until Lottie had to ring the bell with meaning, but as I donâ€™t suppose he dines himself, the meaning may have been obscure. We have advanced Â£10, & for that bought the cutting press, & stipulated that the printing press shall be here by Jan. 14th. The difficulty about these people is their flow of language; personal history must be told at length: I believe its a form of good manners. On Friday we went to a concert, walking out when the English piece came on into a disreputable side street clinging to the back of Bond Stâ€”reminds one rather of a Thackeray novelâ€”a place for the footman of the great to gamble in. Tea at Spikings, with some of the upper classes; who looked like pet dogs threatened with a cold bath. They were talking of the scarcity of motor cars. I bought a pair of stockings & then home.

The stockings were in preparation for Garsington. We came back from that adventure 2 hours ago. Itâ€™s difficult to give the whole impression, save that it wasnt much unlike my imagination. People strewn about in a sealingwax coloured room: Aldous Huxley toying with great round disks of ivory & green marbleâ€”the draughts of Garsington: Brett in trousers; Philip tremendously encased in the best leather; Ottoline, as usual, velvet & pearls; 2 pug dogs. Lytton semi-recumbent in a vast chair. Too many nick nacks for real beauty, too many scents, & silks, & a warm air which was a little heavy. Droves of people moved about from room to roomâ€”from drawing room to dining room, from dining room to Ottolineâ€™s roomâ€”all Sunday. At moments the sense of it seemed to flag; & the day certainly lasted very long by these means. Fredegond was admitted in the morning; & then after tea I had perhaps an hour over a log fire with Ottoline. Going for a walk we ran into a motor full of speckled & not prepossessing young menâ€”one I entirely forget, but he existed, as I counted 4. The most obvious was Evan Morgan, a little red absurdity, with a beak of a nose, no chin, & a general likeness to a very callow but student Bantam cock, who has run to legs & neck. However he was evidently most carefully prepared to be a poet & an eccentricity, both by his conversation, which aimed at irresponsible brilliance, & lack of reticence, & by his clothes, which must have been copied from the usual Shelley picture. But he was as innocent as a chicken & so foolish that it didnâ€™t seem to matter. On the whole I liked Ottoline better than her friends have prepared one for liking her. Her vitality seemed to me a credit to her, & in private talk her vapours give way to some quite clear bursts of shrewdness. The horror of the Garsington situation is great of course; but to the outsider the obvious view is that O. & P. & Garsington house provide a good deal, which isnâ€™t accepted very graciously. However to deal blame rightly in such a situation is beyond the wit of a human being: theyâ€™ve brought themselves to such a pass of intrigue & general intricacy of relationship that theyâ€™re hardly sane about each other. In such conditions I think Ott. deserves some credit for keeping her ship in full sail, as she certainly does. We were made immensely comfortable; a good deal of food; the talk had frequent bare patches, but then this particular carpet had been used fairly often. By talking severely to Philip, L. made him come up to Parliament today. He is a weak amiable long suffering man, who seems generally to be making the best of things, & seeing the best of people whom by nature he dislikes. We came home by Oxford (where I bought 2 writing books, & L. bought a pipe, & we had coffee, & saw the colleges) then to Reading, where we lunched; then to Ealing, where we changed to Richmond. On the top of our return, Alix appeared, & has just left; but I missed most of her, feeling it necessary to have a bath.
