Another lapse in this book, I must confess; but, if I do it against my humour I shall begin to loathe it; so the one chance of life it has is to submit to lapses uncomplainingly. I remember though that we walked, printed, & Margaret came to tea. How pale these elderly women get! The rough pale skin of toads, unfortunately: M. in particular easily loses the flash of her beauty. This time we were whelmed in the Coop, revolution; the characters of Mr King & Mr May, & possibilities. I get an occasional swinge of the tail which reminds me of the extremely insignificant position I have in this important world. I get a little depressed, a little anxious to find faultâ€”a question of not being in the right atmosphere. L. I suppose feels the same about Gordon Sqre. And then the minute care which the elderly & solicitous take of each other impresses me: â€œmust be back or Lilian will be anxiousâ€ questions of fatigue or cold always cropping upâ€”partly the unmarried state perhaps; partly the sense of being the centre of oneâ€™s world, which Margaret very naturally has. But of course her niceness & valiancy always conquer me in spite of injured vanity.
