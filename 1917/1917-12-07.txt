### Friday 7 December

But there was no raid; & as the moon wanes, no doubt we are free for a month. Happily no apprentice today, which gives a sense of holiday. We have had to make it rather clear to Barbara that this job may not be followed by another. She refuses payment for last week. So thereâ€™s no fault to find with her. No one could be nicer; & yet she has the soul of the lake, not of the sea. Or is one too romantic & exacting in what one expects? Anyhow, nothing is more fascinating than a live person; always changing, resisting & yeilding against oneâ€™s forecast; this is true even of Barbara, not the most variable or gifted of her kind. Nessa was up about a governess (Mrs Brereton suggested in place of the faultfinding & man-hunting Miss E.) so I ended ray afternoon in one of the great soft chairs at Gordon Square. I like the sense of space & deep large pattern one gets there. I sat alone for 20 minutes, reading a book on Children & Sex. When Nessa came we had tea & it was discovered that Clive & Mary were in the house; & Norton came in, the same party as usual. As usual to my liking; so much alive, so full of information of the latest kind; real interest in every sort of art; & in people too. I rather expect L. to disagree with all this. I judge by the amount of animation of brain produced in myself, & sense of thoughts all liberated. Not that M.H. open her lips, but she has an air of mute sympathy. I like Norton tooâ€”all that brain hoarded in his head for the most exalted ends, which makes his criticism always impartial. Clive starts his topicsâ€”lavishing admiration & notice upon Nessa, which doesnâ€™t make me jealous as once it did, when the swing of that pendulum carried so much of my fortune with it: at any rate of my comfort. Maynard says that Bonar Law has dished the Government; the country entirely with Lansdowne, & the Government unable to stick to its own declarations. This was from Lord Reading. It sometimes occurs to me that thereâ€™s not a single secret in politics; everything is to be guessed from the newspapers. Nessa had to go round to Rogers, & I walked with her, buying sausages & cheese for a supper party on the way. Roger is becoming one of the successes of the day as a painter of perfectly literal & very unpleasant portraits.

Today (Saturday) we walked to Twickenham, where Leonard took train for Staines. I found Marny when I got back. Its 6.30 & she has just gone; so that if I donâ€™t cover the next 10 pages with family gossip & detail of all sorts its not for want of it. Let me put a little of it down, if I can rememberâ€”but it goes so fast, & turns to ashes without the atmosphere. But Florence Bishop, married to a naval Dr lives in a flat in Earls Courtâ€”gives you Tiptree jam for tea, & looks like a picture, & is very poor, owing to old Bishopâ€™s failings; but her husband is an elderly man, & now takes charge of wounded soldiers in trains. And we havenâ€™t had butter for a long time, & sometimes we canâ€™t even get the nice kind of margarine, but I wont deal at Barkers, not after the evidence at that fire. Wrightâ€™s Coal shed burnt down behind us the other nightâ€”all that coal wasted, & once last winter weâ€™d run out. It was a Saturday too, & I went from shop to shop begging even a scuttlefull, & who should I meet at Knightsbridge but Kitty Maxse? & she said O Iâ€™ll give you coalâ€”why Iâ€™ve got 2 cellars full: & sure enough that very afternoon up she drove in a taxi with a sack full, & that saw us through, but Iâ€™ve not seen her since that day, so distinguished looking, & not a year older, though she must be 50. Well, Iâ€™m 35; & Toad 43â€”but one forgets peoplesâ€™ ages, & Iâ€™m sure I donâ€™t feel old; & you look like 25â€”And Nessa as lovely as ever I suppose! (here followed the whole history of Nessa, Clive, Duncan, Adrian & ourselves).

Dear me, how we all move aboutâ€”partly owing to the war to be sure; though I do see some of my old friends still, like Miss Harris, who paints, you know, & very well too, but she wont show anything because she only considers herself an amateur, & sheâ€™s very busy now with war work. And Hilda Lightbody, I see her; though sheâ€™s making papier machÃ© splints all dayâ€”yes, a widow she is, her husband having been a great invalidâ€”And I sometimes see Adeline, who lives with Hervey, at Hastings for the winter, not having meant to stay there, but they went for a change & there wasnâ€™t any reason why they shouldnâ€™t stayâ€”near the sea, of course; & Millicent not very far off. Millicentâ€™s boy died you know, & Virginia milks cows at Lord Rayleighâ€™s place in Essex. She prefers horses, but she couldnâ€™t get horses, & sheâ€™s very fond of cows. Yes Millicent still lives at Hastings, though she doesnâ€™t like it, but Vere does, because of the sea & they know a great many people, & Millicent got up a series of dances for young people last winter, though she didnâ€™t feel like dancing Iâ€™m sure, & she keeps the musical Festival going, though she wonâ€™t do any war work; & Augusta always loved Kent, & now theyve got a house in Kent, & a little garden, & Bob works for a neighbour sometimes, & so they get along you knowâ€”all the children out in the world now. O its wicked how they grow upâ€”Halford quite a big boyâ€”with a poetic side, but very practical Iâ€™m glad to say, & Janet very like Madge; & I wish Madge would write. Perhaps sheâ€™d be happier then, though I donâ€™t think Madge could ever be really happy, but its a wonderful piece of work, & Iâ€™m sure Will owes her a great deal. I dont think Iâ€™ve gossiped so much for years. And Cousin Mia dead, & Aunt Mary killedâ€”yes. That was extremely sad, but better than a lingering illness I daresay! And Herbert in all the papers; but Lettice doesnâ€™t like London at all, but Herbert does, & she goes back to Sheffield for change of airâ€”& when the raids come, we go & sit with the Walesâ€™ on the ground floor. But they ought to tell one about the Bugles. Why, when they first blew, I thought it might be the Germans themselves, & I went out onto the landing & met a lady, though it was 2, dressed for going out, & she told meâ€”&c &câ€”â€”
