### Saturday 20 October

Happily, or she might say unhappily for Alix she didnâ€™t presumably wander in Piccadilly all night, or the great bomb which ploughed up the pavement opposite Swan & Edgarâ€™s might have dug her grave. We heard two soft distant but unmistakable shocks about 9.30; then a third which shook the window; then silence. It turns out that a Zeppelin came over, hovered unseen for an hour or two & left. We heard no more of it.

Going out for a walk, we ran into a smooth, sleek provincial looking man at the pillar box, our Walterâ€”sent by Heaven for the baptism of this book I think. And he stuck to us for hours; walked with us, came back to tea, & would with encouragement, which flagged, have dined. His stories were all of Lord Canterbury, & Mrs Saxton Noble, & the R.A.: each story throwing a gleam of light upon his own success, or tact, or prosperity. Not much gossip about the King however. He prefers the Queen, & mad Princess Victoria, who breaks into his room & announces that she means to live in his house. His complexion is that of a wax figure, his head is as smooth as an egg; he has the same cultivated taste in books, & style that he used to have, though no longer a writer, or indeed anything but a Secretary to the President, to whom he seems filial & parasitic. To us his attitude is half friendly, half suspicious. He has cast in his lot with the orthodox, but canâ€™t make up his mind to lose the other world entirely.
