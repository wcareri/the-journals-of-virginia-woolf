### Wednesday 5 September

Another fine morning. I walked, & L. did the garden. I saw a clouded yellow [_Colias edusa_] on the top - a very deep yellow the first for a long time. Clouds brewed over the sea, & it began to rain at tea; then great thunder claps, & lightning. Difficult to distinguish thunder from guns. German prisoners walked across the field. They are now helping on this farm. Corn over the road still standing in shocks uncarted. Servants stayed at Charleston all night; say that there was gun fire as well as thunder.
