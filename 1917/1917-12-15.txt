### Saturday 15 December

A cold but sunny day. It seems long since we had a day to ourselves. No printing done. We took a walk in the old style through the Park, down the avenue & back by the river, which was flooding up fast, & cut us off, making us creep along a railing so as to reach dry land. The streets remind me of Cambridge streets. People walk down the middle. This is partly because of the queues waiting to buy at Liptons. One has some difficulty in keeping on the pavement, & the motor buses are always grazing peopleâ€™s sides. Home & a large tea by ourselves. Masses of papers. Perera, of course, to consult one more; & he is still sitting with L. in his room.
