### Tuesday 6 November

The melancholy fact is that Tinker, at the present moment, 5.30, is lost. He was let out in the garden, got into the next door house, & finding their garden door open, presumably escaped. This was discovered at lunch time. When we had done L. went off to look in the neighbourhood, but without success. We took the Bus to Kingston; visited for the last time let us hope in our lives, the Recruiting Office, & after waiting in the familiar room with the two wooden benches, the towel hanging up & the khaki coat, L. was summoned, & given his paper which states that he is â€œpermanently & totally disabled.â€ We suppose this might fetch Â£500 if sold. However, we were rather dashed by the loss of the spaniel whom we had come to like. We gave information at the Police Office. Their immense kindness & good sense much impressed us. After taking notes, ringing up Kew &c. the police sergeant said â€œMuch obliged to you, Sirâ€. Its melancholy to be asking about lost dogs again. After our experience with Tim even I find it hard to be altogether sanguine.
