### Sunday 30 September

A perfect day. Up on the top, & found a handkerchief full of mushrooms. Met Nessa & Roger walking up to meet us. They heard guns over London & saw lights last night. Another raid. We heard nothing; save Mrs Hammond, who heard the guns very loud, as she went home. Clear moonlit nights. They went back after tea.
