### Tuesday 9 October

We had a horrid shock. L. came in so unreasonably cheerful that I guessed a disaster. He has been called up. Though rather dashed for 20 minutes, my spirit mounted to a certainty that, save the nuisance, we have nothing to fear. But the nuisanceâ€”waiting a week, examination at 8.30 at Kingstonâ€”visits to Craig & Wright for certificatesâ€”is considerable. It was piteous to see him shivering, physically shivering, so that we lit his gas fire, & only by degrees became more or less where we were in spirits; & still, if one could wake to find it untrue, it would be a mercy.

We took a proof of the first page of K.M.â€™s story, The Prelude. It looks very nice, set solid in the new type. Masses of bookbinding equipment from Emma Vaughan arrived this morningâ€”rather a testimony to her fads, for it is all good, & I suppose she never bound a book. But this is uncharitable considering. We had a short walk by the river. As it is a fine, fairly still evening, perhaps I shall have a raid to describe tomorrow. Trissie is staying her holiday with us. I forget how many people rang us up this morning, Alix for one, who wants to start her work apparently; & we have a liver & bacon Clumber (spaniel) in view, living at Wimbledon, the property of a man taken for the army. The K. Shuttleworths advertise the birth of a boy with the statement â€œHis Perfect Giftâ€ a good title for an Academy picture, or a Mrs Ward novel, & rather a terrible testimony to the limelight now desired by the rich upon their sacrifices.
