Its ill writing after reading Love for Loveâ€”a masterpiece. I never knew how good it is. And what exhilaration there is in reading these masterpieces. This superb hard English!

A strange spectacleâ€”they went on, knowing wh. way: I suppose someone directed them. One boy was chattingâ€”the others absorbedâ€”like people on the trek. A reason why we cant write like Congreve I suppose.
