### Wednesday 16 June

Apostle Night last night: a good one L. says. Sydneyâ€™s son made one of the best young man speeches. But I have not heard much gossip yet, since it lasted till one; & the morning is given to business. Just finishing the education section: much re-arranged. Then I shall have a few days flutter, I think. Congreve perhaps.

Helen dined with me: & the night before I dined with the Camerons, & heard Tonyâ€™s version of Mary: looks like a gnat, or a jerboa; prominent startled blue eyes, hands held like a jerboas. A pale pretty Shelley imitation American girl there, who sat on the floor, at my feet, & unfortunately adores & worships & gave me primroses one day in the winter & her poems. Not a type from which I now get much kick. Yes. London is hectic. But Iâ€™m going to reserve the next few days for moodiness. Cant always be on the hop without shaking my brains dry. No news of Julian; cant go to MH this week end because Sally may accouche. We have laid down a mattress & clothesâ€™ drying screens to protect her.

Iâ€™ve seen: the Hutchinsons: Diana beautiful, veiled, easy going. Desmond there. Then Ethel Smyth: with her rough old claws scratching. Sniffing out 3 Gs. Then to the Coronation film, bits & bits; some good; others not. Then to Herbertâ€™s on Sunday; oh the ugliness of that perfectly self-satisfied passive stockbrokers life: the Wyandottes, the orchard, the pictureâ€”the coloured photographâ€”the mats, the maids, Freda soft & motherly with a cat for a child: unreal, padded, easy .. & we walked at Staines. Then Adrian after dinner, on a visit of friendship. Then the Bowen, Bowras, Butts; then Helen â€¦ Now lunch.
