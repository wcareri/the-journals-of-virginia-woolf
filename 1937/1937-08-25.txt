### Wednesday 25 August

In London yesterday, & write here because I cannot force myself on with Congreve. I suspect its a failure. Or am I a failure? Not a question I intend to ask: since clearly one must act. In London yesterday, I began: & saw Dr Hart & Archie Cochran about Julian. Rather a physical distress than mental; about his wounds: as if one felt them bodily; Nothing new: only that he was conscious when they got him to hospital, & anxious to explain that the road was dangerous: then anxious to get on with the operation. He became unconscious, talked in French about military things apparently â€¦ & died 4 hours later. Why do I set this down? It belongs to what is unreal now. What is left that is real? Angelica in a yellow handkerchief picking dahlias for the flower show: that Edgar took a gun: & shot Churchillâ€™s white dog: Nessa seemed â€˜betterâ€™: that is could laugh & seem interested. But the reality is very shallow this summer. We had Eddie Playfair this week end & the Maurons & Helen for bowls & tea. I am dried up with talk, with compacting my 2 Â£200 efforts; one on USA: one a story; the Jeweller; now must do Congreve. Very hard work in its way, packing & pressing. I shall soon long for the space & irresponsibility of fiction.

Our telescope came last week. The erudite Eddy focussed it. We have seen Jupiter minus the waiting women: & a plaster cast of the moon. Fog driving home from Charleston last night. The robber caught at South Heighton.

Much forced talk with Hart & Cochran. Cochran a nice simple but rather tense (naturally) practical reddish young man; giving his account stiffly kindly: Hart a Jew; neurotic, rather shiny nosed, intellectual, with the professional surgeons manner. A conflict of sympathy, tragedy, professional manner, & social politeness. Queer rather. A very fine day. Now can I tackle Congreve?
