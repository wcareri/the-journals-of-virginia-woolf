### Tuesday 4 May

The day mother died in 1895â€”that years ago: & I remember itâ€”at the moment, watching Dr Seton walk away up Hyde Park Gate in the early morning with his head bowed, his hands behind his back. Also the doves swooping. We had been sent up to the day nursery after she died; & were crying. And I went to the open window & looked out. It must have been very soon after she died, as Seton was then leaving the house. How that early morning picture has stayed with me! What happened immediately afterwards I cant remember.

Iâ€™m jaded after our youthful partyâ€”they stayed till 12.45. The Bus strike on, so that they couldnâ€™t get busesâ€”had to walk. The streets look odd, all aflutter with bannersâ€”white in Bond Street, red at Selfridges; & no omnibuses; a lower level in the streets; all taxis & innumerable private cars; & droves & herds trudging the pavement. I went to Murrayâ€™s smart new shop in Grosvenor Street; should never have faced it if I hadnt known him in his shabby days: a lovely 18th Century library turned into a work room with long trestle tables, & some big tree on the garden wall outside. Womenâ€”middleaged fat thin short paraded like Ascot horses for my very shy & incompetent observation. I felt the lure of clothes again. Ordered a dressâ€”was tempted to get a coat too. But cant yet feel rich again: thoâ€™ they say The Years is in its 4th printing in America: only an advt. though, & H.B. not so scrupulous as we are. Then had to ford my way along Oxford Street, but the legs & shoulders so pressing & bothering I took to the back streets; finally the Tube; was shoved in at one door, pressed out behind a stout kind man who said â€œBarge after meâ€â€”why â€œbargeâ€? to what social strata does that word belong? Public school, I think (by the way no letters about my BBC except private ones)

The party thoughâ€”jaded as I am I must refer to the party. Sally: Julian; bell rings: the Spenders; Chilver: William. So we were crowdedâ€”no fire: a hot spring night. Julian was bitter at dinner against the Bâ loomsbury habit of education. He had been taught no job; only a vague literary smattering. But I wanted you to go to the Bar, I said. Yes, but you didnâ€™t insist upon it to my mother, he remarked, rather forcibly. He now finds himself at 29 without any special training. But then he objected, as I thought, to all professions. An argument in favour of my Â½ professions. Sally agreed. Downstairs we found Inez; controlled; small: of the Greek horse type; a little fixed & rigid; shy I daresay; in a red dressing gown dress: very silent; precise. William immensely fat; as if just taken off the Brighton pier: jubicund: much Hugh gossip & banter; H. is becoming a Knight, thoâ€™ I know youâ€™ll laugh. I was in favour of his Autobiography Julian against it. The Chilver sat all inhibited & nerve drawn, so I had to give him claret & sit by him & make party talk, about carpentering & bulbs. He wd. like to leave the Air Ministry & become a carpenterâ€”make good chairsâ€”but of course wont & cant, though Sally urges. Another aspect of the professional question. Air Ministry long hours, hard work; but regular & safe. Julian now all in favour of a settled job: even the Treasury. He is learning the mechanics of lorries. Hadnâ€™t even been taught that at Cambridgeâ€”only the eternal Popeâ€”wh. I scrambled through as a child. Poor old Julianâ€”rather on a crazy edge of life I feel. And then there was some well informed political talk to which Inez contributed, dispassionately, sensibly. I daresay thereâ€™s something to her; but why they chose to connect themselves foreverâ€”she & Stephenâ€”God knows. Seemed to me completely separate: he critical, polite, unintimate with her.

Every moment till we go seems now numbered like stones in a buildingâ€”& thats why I shall be so relieved on Fridayâ€”no numbers of any stones for almost 3 weeksâ€”And thenâ€”Still more must this be true of L. who, with every moment plotted has to endure the actual presence of Mrs Jones, who stumped round on foot just now, employed by Dr Jones. Reminds me of Mrs Cartwright & the General strike, arriving on a rusty bicycle. Desmond is going to do L.S. on the 26th May. Shall I go? in my new dress? Nothing from the TLS about Gibbon: but Dadie writes that G. Trev. approved. Odd how recognition eddies about. Now to write to Susie Buchan.
