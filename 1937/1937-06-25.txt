### Friday 25 June

To the Albert Hall meeting last night. The last I swear. Inaudible. Megaphone to those behind merely vociferates split words. A little family gossip. Nessa Duncan Morgan. Oh but I liked being introduced to Auden, who wanted Stephen to bring him up. A small rough haired terrier man: slits for eyes; a crude face; interesting, I expect, but wire haired, yellowish white. Charles Trevelyan &c. Then speeches. Then semi jocular money collecting; then an auction of pictures. One by Picasso: one by Kapp. All very stagey empty & unreal. Wogan with his arm in a sling: looked tragic when unwatched, so I thought, listening to the Basque children singing on the gramophone. Robeson sang: a sympathetic, malleable, nigger, expressive, uninhibited, all warmth. & the hot vapours of African forests. I took several snubs & benedictions; thus:â€”Bunny cold, Morgan indifferent, Auden warm, Sally friendly; Kingsley Martin uneasyâ€”a man I dont likeâ€”so voluble, histrionic, & he drove us home, taking a hand off the wheel to gesticulateâ€”a different style of driving from Leonardâ€™s. Iâ€™m hurrying. Cant analyse. Off to MH. No puppies. A finer day. Olaf Stapledon has sent me his new book: wh. flatters me, as 3 papers say itâ€™s a masterpiece; the 4th says its bad. But am I more genially disposed because he says he admires me? Oh for this perfect soul business: how can we pretend to it? Starting my Congreve: going to do it in 3 days at MH. Then back to 3 Gs. refreshed.
