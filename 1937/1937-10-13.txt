George Davis came & commissioned a story I think. On top of him Philip Hart the Dr who was with Julian when he died. The facts now seem to be: Julian was brought in with a very bad woundâ€”looked deathly white. He asked H. What chance have I? Hart told him 80 per cent recover. A lie. He had only the chances of a miracle. He was very brave. After the operation, H. saw him comfortably in bed. Went back 2 hours later & found him dozing half conscious. And so he remained till he died that night. Hart said Julian & the other man lay under the ambulance. They might, & could have taken cover in a trench. But it is impossible to take precautions always. Julian was hit by a side splash from a shell: the other man not touched. It was as if he were killed at once. The mind of a person so wounded is only on immediate things. He said nothing about Nessa. Was anxious to get on with the operation.

This does not tally altogether with the other accounts: P.H. & the others thought he was alone, & so on. But now there is no more to be discovered. Hart was tormented by some sense of guilt. That they had not kept J. from the front. They would have done so later. This was his first experience. Things are now much more dangerous. The Ambulance is almost as dangerous as the Army. And so he went. He said that the worst fighting is about to come. A long talk. Like Tisdall to look at. A nice, sensitive thin man, an enthusiast. If we allowed arms thro we shd save thousands of lives.

& then I go upstairs & find L. enraged with the L. Party which sent a deputation to the F.O. & was diddled by Vansittart. So we shant let arms through: we shall sit on the fence: & the fighting will go onâ€”But I am not a politician: obviously, can only rethink politics very slowly into my own tongue.
