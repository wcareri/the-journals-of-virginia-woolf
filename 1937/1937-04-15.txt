And Stephen says The Years is the best of my books, & Kingsley alsoâ€”but that donâ€™t please me. Stephen does. Not so much as it should. Yet soon I can cast up my accounts about The Years: add, subtract & cast up & say no more. A long close political argument. Julian, KM, Stephenâ€”all calling each other by Xtian names. What is our duty? What is the responsible man like KM to do? Cant be a pacifist; the irresponsible can. I sat there splitting off my own position from theirs, testing what they said, convincing myself of my own integrity & justice. K.M. very neurotic, dark eyed, melodramatic. A much travelled too easily agitated superficial manâ€”all froth & feelingâ€”self questioningâ€”not rooted. Julian peppery & pithyâ€”making his strange faces, suddenly hooting with laughterâ€”uncouth rather, yet honest, yet undisciplined, yet keeping something up his sleeve. Obstinately set on going to Spainâ€”wont argue; tight; hard fistedâ€”has amusing phrases â€œjoining for duration of the quarrelâ€. Harry Pollitt cuts up rough when asked to arrange Tonyâ€™s & Stephenâ€™s amoursâ€”not unnaturally, as KM. said: being in control of the CP in this warâ€”being ravaged by deaths: pestered also by relations. The CP will only accept those who are devoted to The Cause. KM. lives much in the military area; so we discussed hand grenades, bombs, tanks, as if we were military gents in the war again. And I felt flame up in me 3 Gs. wh. has been submerged by Gibbon & BBCâ€”that I should revise now, but cant screw this morning, after all that chatter. Stephen runs on too fluent, too formless; but as I say gave me a shock of pleasure. Says The Years gives him the sense of time; & is so preciseâ€”but he will write upon it in The Left Review. So thats the young on my side. Against: Vita; Elizabeth Williamson; Hugh Walpole; For: Maynard, Hayward, Kot, Nessa, Stephen; I refer only to the speakers not to the writers, whom to differentiate would take a whole morning. The complete absence of fan mail is curious. But America is now just beginning. And did I say that they soldâ€”oh I think I did: & am rambling. Reading Balzac: reading A. Birrellâ€™s memoirs; & now shall shut my Gibbon rather reluctantly: I wd. like to finish. Shall I begin another article? Scottâ€™s letters?
