### Sunday 29 August

Yes I am tackling Congreve, because I want to be quit of all articles & ready for 3 Gs on the 1st.

How far would this energy of the mind carry meâ€”could I take this narcotic successfully if Leonard died, if Nessa died? I come out here at 10 & dont wake to anything but Congreve till one. Go in with my head swaying like a captive balloon. The thing is theres no richness & security when I wake. No depth of happiness to refresh myself in. Considerable agility & gaiety & chatter. Mrs Curtis, William Plomer, Janie, Q. & A., over yesterday. Mrs C. reminds me of Jean Thomas: something spuriousâ€”showing off. Sheâ€™s a highly successful liver: had Â£200: therefore borrowed, ran Langford Grove; lodges 10 people on top of Firle down; is adventurous, stack full of go & slapdash; but somehow not convincing as a character. Too smooth & slick & so on. A useful phrase when Iâ€™m writing in a hurry. A very hot August again. Bowls have become a passion. I gave up a walk to play. But then Iâ€™m anxious to vary the day. How independent I feel myself of tradition; & what to do next. Simply trust to life? I think Roger said he trusted life on the whole. I mean, no cut & dried rules possible. I must think out some autumn plans one of these days. We saw the Ring of Saturn last night, like a cardboard collar. The man is still at large. Mrs Curtis pretends that she is elemental: I think thats it, sets a meal out for him & entertains cosmopolitanly. Why does any showing off mildew everything? William was portentously stout, red, & healthy. He lives at Brighton for the breezes he says, & finds Capeâ€™s MSS. distracts him from novel writing. But in fact, as the chatter was so incessant I had no gossip or silent listening with him. And now there is little to add, except that the British Ambassador in Japan has been shot: Santander has fallen; there is war between China & Japan; Clive is at Grenoble, & for 2 days Iâ€™ve had no letters, nor yet heard if my Jeweller is commissioned
