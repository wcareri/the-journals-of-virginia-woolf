### Monday 28 June

Home is the hunter, home from the hill, & the Wolves are back from Monks House. And much refreshed into, the bargain. Three solitary nights. Think of that! Was there ever such a miracle? Not a voice, not a telephone. Only the owl calling; perhaps a clap of thunder, the horses going down to the Brooks, & Mr Botten calling with the milk in the morning. A hot sulphurous week end, as if a cloud of white dust were over Lewes. The red grasses cut. Hay in black marks on the hill. Some, in the meadows, still up to my knees, & able to cover me as I lay on the river bank yesterday. We got very hot trying to move a chairâ€”for L. this time; but it stuck; Louie & I butted like rams; L. hauled like a horse. There it stuck half way up the stairs & was only moved, down again, by Percy in his best Sunday brown coat. (By the way he talks of leaving). Up at 7.30 this morning, picked a rose, & drove up through Wimbledon, as Wandsworth Bridge is mending. Wimbledon all lush & pastoral; a crowd in Portland Road, but back by 10.30, & at work on the Second Guinea by 11. It is now started, that very difficult chapter, but I was heartened by reading some of the first: saw it as 3 Chapters suddenly; & if I can drive my pen hard, might have it done by August. But theres a terrible lot of reasoning (for me) & fitting in of the right quotations. Roger waiting too. Letters from Altounyan, Mary Fisherâ€”Willy is dead: saw it on Fridayâ€™s placardâ€”& the dossier from Ethel Smyth.
