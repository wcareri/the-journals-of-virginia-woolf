### Friday 29 January

Wells rather shrunk. Hair still brown, but has the dyed appearance of hair that is brown on an old face. Lines more marked: skin less plumped out. He was very affable: put both hands on top of L.â€™s to signalise his regret I suppose for their quarrel. Budberg is a sympathetic broad faced slow moving soft eyed slav; dignified & sincere I think. Not a nonentity. Even able to impress her slow broken English upon H.G.â€™s little sparrow chirp. He sat by me, & was a little apprehensive of the highbrow at first I think. We made talk about Scotland; then he laughed at Compton Mackenzie, always dressing up: then switched off on to the poverty of authors, & instanced Arnold. He totted up A.â€™s expense & receipts. Then we got on to Russian politics, so, somehow to Tom Eliot. Tee Ess he called him with a hiss of despite; & then proceeded to say how he, which I think meant we, had been the death of English literature. Afraid of being vulgar, thats what was at the root of it. And Tomâ€™s religion. By that we came to the Archbishop. I wonderâ€”if I had any brains in my foolish little head, I wish they would reveal this to me: does Cosmo Gordon Lang ever alone at dead of night face his Trinity? We all have toâ€”But does he â€¦ & so on. He likes to be listened to; & to chatter on, loosely generally, as he said to me when the gentlemen came upstairs. Weâ€™ve had a loose general kind of talk. Then he lay back in the arm chair, put his tiny hands & still tinier feet together, & chirped away. Sometimes Budberg interrupted with her solemn intoning: attacked Germany; defended France. It was old manâ€™s talk; mellower than I remembered; mischievous; eyes a little bleared; kindly in his way; merry. Had been warned off the air for some joke; off the Daily Mail for another joke. He gives the impression that on the whole he is a detached satisfied little man; conscious of his lack of distinction; prone to snap at any pretence; introduced â€œmy father the professional cricketerâ€; content I think with his position, & immensely interested still. He wished to live to be 170. is 70. Had one seen him behind a counter he wd. have seemed the very type of busy little grocer. I couldnt ever detect any mass behind his pointed beak. And I suspect that when he faces his Trinity at dead of night there are a good many books that he thinks justly, trash: & he shuffles his hands among the loose innumerable pages; & then snaps at Culture; but remembers that he has done a vast mass of work, & thinks it wont all die; & is amused at the place he has madeâ€”from Bromley Kent to Regents Park: the Baroness; & I suppose the greatest circulation in the whole world. A humane man in some corner; also brutal; also entirely without poetry.

This I scribble with the snow darkening my skylight; we are not going to Rodmell: I need not present prizes to the young Animal Fanciers; & we are waiting to see if Mr Rich of Rich & Cowan will tell us about Miss Lange.

Slight uneasinesses pass like vapour already over me: prelude to The Years. Miss Bevan has read the proofs but says nothing; Miss West presumably had read & did say nothing. And I must expect that attitude on my friends part. And I must dig myself deep in 3 Guineas â€¦ so that the other voices are scarcely heard. It will be immensely depressing; but Iâ€™ve no doubt I can survive.
