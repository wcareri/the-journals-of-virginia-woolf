### Thursday 2. September

With this odd mix up of public & private I left off: & finished my Congreve, the end too crowded, but forced myself to take it to the post just as Q. & A. & Janie drove up to tea. And todays a holiday: letter writing; reading, how strangelyâ€”to hear his voice so clear from the other side of the graveâ€”Julian on War. I hear his sharp quizzical laugh now & then: something like Clive; shrewd & biting. But as usual, the whirl of things, of things half grasped & sweeping on, like a staircase that for ever passes the platformâ€”bewilders me. Why could he never force himself to think to the bottom of his idea? But Iâ€™m stopping in the middle; write here to make myself take breath. 5 past 12.
