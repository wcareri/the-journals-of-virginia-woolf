### Monday 15 March

Spending a lazy morning. Tired in the head. Too much talkâ€”Julian & Bunnyâ€”why do we live in such a way that the sight of our oldest friends & nephews back from China gives us a little shock of regretâ€”I mean misery for the quiet evening gone? Julian set & rather self centred. Can only think what he ought to do. Still if what he ought to do is something for the world at large, one must excuse this grinding of an iron upon a Granite slab. Anyhow, being too tired to write, Iâ€™ve been thinking cd. I recast the rejected section of The Years for the Uniform Edition? Why do I bother? Only I rather suspect its needed for the whole argument impression. But there it is, safe; & I neednâ€™t consider this seriously at the moment. Keep it at the back of my mind, & judge from reviewsâ€”save that theyâ€™re all so scatter brainedâ€”how far the book misses fire on that account. We are staying till 3.30: L. has rung up the Press & about 25 more Years have been ordered. A good sale possible I think. Say 10, or 11, or 12,000.

Brooding over Gibbon. Perhaps a weeks break to finish that wd be good. I dont think I shall much mind the chitter chatter; shall be glad when this following week is over; all reviews out & forgotten; & then Lord the pleasure of coming here for 10 quiet days at Easter. And they shall be quiet tooâ€”that I swear. We have done our duty by family & society quite sufficiently.
