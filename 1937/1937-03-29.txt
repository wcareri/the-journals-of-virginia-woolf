### Monday 29 March

The misery is passing off in its usual wayâ€”a drowsy slackness this morning. And there is nothing much to stir it. I read a great deal yesterdayâ€”Whiteâ€™s Selborne, & the London Spy. A very cold night. No, this is hardly worth writing out. A man in an overcoat took notes in the field yesterday, & then someone banged on the door. I sat tight. L. was at Charleston. Julian, he says, very depressed. Today Ethel S. writes that she has read The Y. but will not comment till she has re-read. I suppose dislikes it. Wellâ€”& will look in on Wednesday. No. My policy is to lie low & invite no visitors till the summer is overâ€”a luxurious couching like a fox on its nest. Meredith is an influential writer: how wd it be to counter him with H. James? a kind of medical mixture? And my books are waiting at Lewes: Southeyâ€™s commonplace book; Leaves of Grass: Clarendonâ€™s history in 6 volsâ€”rather a leap in the darkâ€”all for Â£1-8.
