Isherwood & Sally last night. Iâ sherwood rather a find: very small red cheeked nimble & vivacious. We chattered. He lives in a pension at Brussels; is heir to an Eâ lizabeâ than house near Manchester; & likes my books. The last put some colour into my cheeks. He said Morgan & I were the only living novelists the youngâ€”he, Auden, Spender I supposeâ€”take seriously. Indeed he admires us both I gathered warmly. For M.â€™s books he has a passion. â€œIâ€™ll come out with it then Mrs Woolfâ€”you see, I feel youre a poetess: he does the thing I want to do â€¦ a perfect contraption.â€ But I was satisfied with my share of the compliment wh. came very pat in these days of depression. Auden & he are writing away together. He does the prose, A. the poetry. A. wants innumerable blankets on his bed; innumerable cups of tea; then shuts the shutters & draws the blinds & writes. Id. is a most appreciative merry little bird. A real novelist, I suspect; not a poet; full of acute observations on character & scenes. Odd how few â€˜novelistsâ€™ I know: it wd. interest me to discuss fiction with him. Sally rather smudged & pale: but then Id. & I were such chatterboxes. Suddenly he said he must meet John Andrews at Rules & motor to Croydon, has to fly to Paris for one day today. Such is the life of the young when theyre not preparing revolutions. One of the most vital & observant of the young: & a relief after the mute dismals of the others. In fact both he & Sally now think things are going well in England, & that Madrid wont fall. So we chop & change. Iâ€™ve now â€˜doneâ€™ 8 incidents. Julian Fry alas for tea.
