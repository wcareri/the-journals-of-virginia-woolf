### Sunday 26 September

Tom & Judith here: therefore I am not writing the end of 3 Gs: which has kept me completely submerged from 10 to one every morning; & driven me like a motor in the head over the downs to Piddinghoe &c every afternoon from 2 to 4. Then we play bowls from 5 to 6. Then read. Then cook dinner. Then wireless. Then read. Then chocolates. Then bed. And so it begins again. But there have been so many interruptions, the specimen day is the exception. We went to Sissinghurstâ€”unrecorded: with Eve A. & Q.: Vita with that silent goodness, & Harold too, a sense of the human understanding unspoken, & now that Gwen is not there, for me more unbroken. Many improvements: men digging; an Elizabethan drain being dug up. Lady S.â€™s money now supplies Vita with enough to store the house, which is too museum like perhaps. The red amber stood in the light: Persian pots: too many possessions. & then Vita shows that she inherits the magpie gift of her mother, but stabilised & dignified by the old honourable yet rather null Sackvilles. Iâ€™m drawing upon Pepita for this illuminating sketch.

Not a happy summer. That is all the materials for happiness; & nothing behind. If Julian had not diedâ€”still an incredible sentence to writeâ€”our happiness might have been profound. â€œOurâ€â€”L.â€™s & mine, now that The Years has sold between 40 & 50,000 in America; now that we are floated financially, & perhaps to shift the Press & take a new house, & privately as happy & rounded off as can beâ€”but his deathâ€”that extraordinary extinctionâ€”drains it of substance. I do not let myself think. That is the fact. I cannot face much of the meaning. Shut my mind to anything but work & bowls. Now theres Tom & Judith, & I think I have solved the week end problem, & made it a reasonable & even enjoyable habit, as it should beâ€”having friends in the house. Tom in some waysâ€”with his sensitive, shrinking, timid but idiosyncratic natureâ€”is very like myself. This morning, as Priestleyâ€™s play is praised, he is uneasy, as I shd be, & insinuates, as I should, distrust of critics, yet reads them, as I do, furtively. Tom is liverish looking, tired; but revives under the effect of Judithâ€™s fresh & downright & able but not sophisticated, or I daresay, highly aesthetic, youth. She is a whopper: a strapper; yet with the usual complexities I think, submerged. I should however write a pack of letters; to Vita (who sent me Nessaâ€™s little message: to me so profoundly touching, thus sent secretly via Vita that I have â€˜helpedâ€™ her more than she can say) & to Chambrun, my employer: & to the Fabian, & others, for with the autumn letters begin, & publicity puts its rather heavy, not altogether unacceptable fingers on me. More letters than usual of praise & demands therefore.
