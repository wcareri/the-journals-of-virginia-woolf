Yes, thatâ€™ll be niceâ€”to sit out of doors & drink, in some French town, away from all this. I ought to buy a dress; from Murray; but canâ€™t be bothered. Opera last night: Raymond, Molly & Shaw Taylor: not as fine as it used to be; & a faded arty opera, Ariane. BBC rehearsal at 3: then Memoir Club. Sales slackening. Coronation impending. But on the 7th weâ€™re off. BBC have asked L. to do a whole series. Never again will I read even one talk.
