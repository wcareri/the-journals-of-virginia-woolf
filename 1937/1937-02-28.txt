### Sunday 28 February

Iâ€™m so entirely imbued in 3 Guineas that I can hardly jerk myself away to write here, (here in fact I again dropped my pen to think about my next paragraphâ€”universitiesâ€”how will that lead to professions & so on.) Its a bad habit. Yesterday it was effectively broken by Desmond who came punctually at one, & stayed till 7.15. nor did we stop talking all that time. Nor was I once bored or wished it to stop. A greater tribute to D. cdnâ€™t be paid. What did we talk about? The Amberley Papers: the Russells: her self conscious control: how she lies on the floor in an attitude calculated to attract, but pretends to ignore it. Now I like nothing better than conscious allurement, D. said. I said was he no longer attracted. And he cried out No, its all goneâ€”all gone. As a man in a train said, Iâ€™m not impotent, but Iâ€™ve had enough. This may have been to shut off all thoughts of the nameless American lady. Anyhow, he was well litâ€”dear old Desmondâ€”as round as a marble: a paunch pendant; but nearly bald: with an odd 18th Century look, as if he had been dining at the Club with Johnsonâ€”a kind of Goldsmith or Boswell; a congenial spirit. And as full of human kindness as a ripe grape with juice. I think he had set himself now not to write a great book but to be nice to other people. What can I do for you, was his last remark on the stairs. Alas, he carried off The Years, wh. meansâ€”well, never mind. We talkedâ€”so easily & merrily. I went back to old talks with Lyttonâ€”talking shop about Kiplingâ€™s style: he had the same quotationâ€”about the man who cut his throat & looked like a robin redbreastâ€”that I had. Then how Jack Squire has imposed another false self upon his true self, which is sensitive, unhappy. He dresses up as Dr Johnson, but a Johnson without the power of speech. Lives now with Miss Warrender & drinks: she teaches him not to drink & he teaches her to drink. So to the death of Margaret Cornish after scalding her foot in St Georgeâ€™s Hospital. He was rung up as he was working at 2: went to the hospital; saw she was dying, so red & panting. Told her not to be afraid. Molly too deaf to hear so went home. D. & Cecilia sat there. Her breathing was like a saw going up & down. And they prolonged it with oxygen; so that she lay tortured till 6 when they heard the stump of the nurses bringing early tea, & the voices of children like birds, & then she died. Dear old Desmond, infinitely human & sensibleâ€”a good send-off from him to the other world. So to Rachel & Michael. & soâ€”but now its one, on a snowy Sunday. We were prevented from going to MH. Miss Bevan strained the car. Its axle has to be mended. But a wet dreary week end anyhow.
