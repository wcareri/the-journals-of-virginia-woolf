### Saturday 20 February

I turn my eyes away from the Press as I go upstairs, because there are all the Review Copies of The Years packed & packing. They go out next week: this is my last week end of comparative peace. What do I anticipate with such clammy coldness? I think chiefly that my friends wont mention it, will turn the conversation rather awkwardly. I think I anticipate considerable lukewarmness among the friendly reviewersâ€”respectful tepidity; & a whoop of red Indian delight from the Grigs will joyfully & loudly announce that this is the long drawn twaddle of a prim prudish bourgeois mind, & say that now no one can take Mrs W. seriously again. But violence I shant so much mind. What I think I shall mind most is awkwardness when I go, say to Tilton or Charleston, & they dont know what to say. And since we shant get away till June I must expect a very full exposure to this damp firework atmosphere. They will say its a tired book; a last effort â€¦ Well, now that Iâ€™ve written that down I feel that even so I can exist in that shadow. That is if I keep hard at work. And thereâ€™s no lack of that. I discussed a book of illustrated incidents with Nessa yesterday; we are going to produce 12 lithographs for Xmas, printed by ourselves. As we were talking, Margery Fry rang up to ask me to see Julian Fry about Roger. So that begins to press on me. Then L. wants if possible to have 3 Gs. for the autumn: & I have my Gibbon, my broadcast, & a possible leader on Biography to fill in chinks. I plan to keep out of literary circles till the mild boom is over. And this, waiting, under consideration is after all the worst. This time next month I shall feel more at ease. And its only now & then I mind now
