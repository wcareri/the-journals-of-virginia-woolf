Mrs Woolf will you do me a great service? chirped up that bright little bird Isherwood at Richardâ€™s last night. It was to send a message to a conference of Int. Libertarians at Madrid. He was going with Auden & Stephen & Miss Townsend Warner. But he rang up just now to ask for Hugh Walpoleâ€™s number & said that the whole thing is probably forbidden by the F.O. owing to various incompetences. It was a hard youthful comfortless but honest & genuine evening, dining in R.â€™s front room with no blinds: a chicken he & Ann had cooked; asparagus fried by mistakeâ€”but he a very attentive quick witted host. And wine &c. And a cat & flowers. White walls, no colour. All tidy & bare. Ann in pink, handsome truculent, concealing some sensibilities, I suppose, of a feminine kind. An odd vessel for passionate loveâ€”I mean for tender considerate love. But there it is I suppose making her sometimes sharp. But much more mature. In came, or down from his room came, Morgan with the bright bird. Morgan on taking his coat offâ€”a very hot nightâ€”revealed a round barrel. Has he suddenly grown a fat man? Rather silent, hopping pecking, skimming away as usual. Talk of the Albert Hall meeting & Madrid mostly. Morgan rose to Â£5 on the wings of Miss Brown. Rather glad of bed & sleep. But a good evening in its hard adolescent way. And Richard maybe not a desirable son in law, as Adrian says. I wonder: but cant wonder, must lunch. In full flush of 2nd Guinea now. Years still top. Even higher. 7th printing. But what does that mean? That I can buy a book case?
