Julian Fry last night. Stories about his ranch. The condition of the beef trade. Unfinished work: thin cows sent to England. Stories of dances: driving home; â€œlit upâ€: we gave him the honk honk honk & the ra ra ra; my wifes passionate: they say a man marries a woman like his mother: no dont send me that letter. I like to know of it (Rogerâ€™s praises) but if it were there in an envelope I cdnâ€™t read it. Stayed from 5:15 to 12. & oh I was sleepy after talking to G. Sturgeon in Râ ichmond Park. No time. The translator coming
