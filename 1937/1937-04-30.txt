### Friday 30 April

So we have reached the last day of this agitating monthâ€”far better than I could have foreseen. Doesnt the Lit Sup this morning finish its Centenary article by a reference to that great artist V.W. & The Years, & head it with the same immortal name? Why do they go out of their way to be polite, I wonder? If it werenâ€™t for Julian going to Spain I should be wholly content on our French journey.

The BBC was moderately successful: that is I got my pecker up & read with ease & emotion; was then checked by the obvious fact that my emotion did not kindle George Barnes who is long & weary & reminds me of Adrian in his weary days (A. is no longer so wearyâ€”he had tea the other day & I found him sympathetic). But the bright bubble, the fly in the eye, & all the other effectsâ€”premonitory shivers & disgusts of that BBC gently subsided & vanished as I walked home through the cold streets alone, & thought that very few people had listened: the world much as usual. So great was the relief that I was very cordial to Barnes, & would have agreed to do another had he asked me. Remember, however, to refrain from that folly.

A very cold grey day; the Busmen threaten to strike tonight; streets laced across; camps & latrines in all the parks, like the Crimea; poles with silver hatchets along the pavements. The Queen told David Cecil that she went all ice at the thought of the Coronation; said the monarchy hadnt the same position as in the days of Victoria. They went to grand partyâ€”Haroldâ€™sâ€”at B.P.: & agreed that the food was bad, & the wine delicious. King Georgeâ€™s hair curls; Queen Eth is growing fat; jewels were worn, & the Band played The Merry Widow in a back room. There are miles of corridors to be walked. Many guests came in taxis. They had Lord S.â€™s car. All the fiddles are tuning up. Barnes told me the BBC is having 150 microphones & observers along the route. I shall try to listen in from some French cafÃ©. Seats are still to be had; my hairdresserâ€™s assistant bought one for 15/- in the New Zealand Stand. Hugh Walpole is to be knighted. We are giving a youthful partyâ€”Spenders, Chilvers, Julian, Plomer on Monday: cut Sibyl & the Bob Cecils lunch, & leave on Fridayâ€”that is one week, in which I must settle the question of clothes. In the past month & a half I have written Gibbon; Gibbonâ€™s Aunts; & the BBC, thus making I hope about Â£60: but oh such hard work. Gibbon remains to be copied outâ€”the last turn of the screw. When I come back I shall instantly pounce on 3 Guineas & see what I can do.

Allington sneers at me on the BBCâ€”too clever â€œfor myself who am only a simple personâ€â€”& wrist watches were not invented in 1880â€”so the deans have their vanity, & if I say what I mean in 3 Guineas I must expect considerable hostility. Yet I so slaver & silver my tongue that its sharpness takes some time to be felt. This maundering must cease: I must face the weekend drive down, so calm & happy, now its all over.

L.â€™s doctor says the eczema is much better: a disease afflicting printers oddly enough: a man, Dr Rau, intelligent enough to play with theories he cant answer. Ewart refuse for some inscrutable reason to put in our new watercloset: Norrisâ€™s mechanations suspected; with what else can I fill this last blue inch?â€”sales of The Y. about 10,250; Amberleys going on for 300. Mr Pritchard thought me very original & amusing last night. Stephen Spender thinks The Y. my best book: poetical in the right sense; Nessaâ€™s show early next week. Shall I buy one? Am rather stingy at the moment. Now I shall stop
