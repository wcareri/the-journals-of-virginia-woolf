### Wednesday 15 December

And then I had one of my little dips into the underworldâ€”a temperature, sofa, 3 days recumbent, Monks House in a snowstorm; no walking; foot & mouth still dominant; back to our party. Young Newnham, all most free & easy, vigorous & inspiritingâ€”Nat & Harry & George & Margaret & Ann Williams & Elizabeth somebody elseâ€”all sitting on the floor; & thenâ€”writing, writing; the 1st chapter taken on Monday to the Chancery Lane typist; cold & rain; visits from Mrs Woolf & Herbert, from John yesterday; the Press question looms & lapses; offers from Rodker & Seeker & even Miss Lange wd. like to buy; & our views change: secretly we both wish to fade, not to sell; but John is eager to buy, yet stingy; must consult Isherwood & Stephen; & settle by mid January; Vita, who dined, more matronly & voluptuous than ever, wont go in with them: a parcel of hot headed & ignorant boys;â€”well, no use trying to pull this five minutes before lunch sentence together so I stop it. I have spent Â£35 on a picture by Duncan, nervously; Karin has taken a house in Regents Park & is transported; Adrian & Katie Lewis hit it off very well at tea; Nessa & Angelica go on Sunday to Cassis. Christmas is on us, & owing to Lord Ivorâ€™s gossip, I am once more riddled by invitations from Sybil. I hope to find an Italian oil jar & a column waiting upstairs.
