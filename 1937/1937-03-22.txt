### Monday 22 March

No I didnt. It rained. And I left my umbrella apparently in a bus. And my brain is tiredâ€”yes, it was a strain, holding myself erect through the suspense of last week. Now Iâ€™ve a holiday from reviews till Wednesday (Listener) then till Sunday, & Desmond does it. And all 3 Gs. is held upâ€”yet I have it pressing for speech. Can I describe old Kot. yesterday. L. looked at the telephone, thinking he was mad. Had been â€˜illâ€™. Mere solitude mania I think. Calmed down. Gave us tea on hard chairs in basement, abused Ott & Murry. So shall now stop writing for a day.
