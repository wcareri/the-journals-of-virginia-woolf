### Friday 11 June

Brain rather dried up after 6 days strenuous London. Tuesday dinner to meet Duff Cooper; Wednesday Ethel Smyth; Thursday Nessa & dressmaker; Friday Harcourt Brace. So Iâ€™m running in a circle, having got on to the university chapter a difficult one. Very very hot. Very noisy. The hotel dancing: buses everywhere; a hop & frying. And on top, Julian gone to Spain on Monday: & on Tuesday, news that Wogan was wounded, a man with him killed. So, a strain: which I cannot now go into: & it must lastâ€”how long? A year? Who knows? Anything to keep talking, inventing, distracting.
