### Tuesday 17 August

Not much to say. Its true, the only life this summer is in the brain. I get excited writing. 3 hours pass like 10 minutes. This morning I had a moment of the old raptureâ€”think of it!â€”over copying The Duchess & the Jeweller, for Chambrun NY. I had to send a synopsis. I expect heâ€™ll regret the synopsis. But there was the old excitement, even in that little extravagant flashâ€”more than in criticism I think.

At Charleston yesterday in the rain. I take the train to Lewes; shop; 4.35 bus; reach Charleston for tea. Its true that I cannot write about Nessa: have to keep myself from thinking about her.

Happilyâ€”if thats the wordâ€”I get these electric shocksâ€”Cables asking me to write. Chaâ mâ brun offers Â£500 for a 9,000 word story. And I at once begin making up adventuresâ€”10 days of adventures;â€”a man rowing with black knitted stockings on his arms.

Do I ever write, even here, for my own eye? If not, for whose eye? An interesting question, rather. Iâ€™m musing on the nature of Audenâ€™s egotism. Suspect its something to do with uneasiness. He wants to write straight from the heart: to discard literature; egotism may be his way of orienting himself. What I mean I dont quite know, perhaps that it seems to him thats being honest, simple, naked, taking off literary clothes. A letter from Tom; uneasily egotistic also. Or do I impute this? Eddy Playfair & the Maurons impend. The weather has broken. A great rain storm last night. Bridge up as we drove back: a ship coming up. The river men running about in great coats with sticks like conspirators in the 17th Century. We talked at Charleston about America. Nessa made A. read aloud a description of a flood in Dr Heynes book. She has read this with interest. She has a considerable detached imaginative power. This may help. Then A. & Q. But now & then she looks an old woman. She reminds me of father taking Thobyâ€™s arm: so she asks Q. to help her. How can she ever right herself though? Julian had some queer power over herâ€”the lover as well as the son. He told her he could never love another woman as he loved her. He was like her; yet had a vigour, a roughness, & then as a child, how much she cared for him. I mean, he needed comfort & sympathy more I think than the others, was less adapted to get on in the worldâ€”had a kind of clumsiness, of Cambridge awkwardness, together with his natural gaiety. And thats all lost for the sake of 10 minutes in an ambulance. I often argue with him on my walks; abuse his selfishness in going but mostly feel floored by the complete muddle & waste. Cant share the heroic raptures of the Medical Aid, who are holding a meeting next week to commemorate the six who were killed. â€œGave their livesâ€ as they call it.
