### Friday 9 April

â€œSuch happiness wherever it is known is to be pitied for tis surely blind.â€ Yes, but my happiness isnâ€™t blind. That is the achievement, I was thinking between 3 & 4 this morning, of my 55 years. I lay awake so calm, so content, as if Iâ€™d stepped off the whirling world into a deep blue quiet space, & there open eyed existed, beyond harm; armed against all that can happen. I have never had this feeling before in all my life; but I have had it several times since last summer: when I reached it, in my worst depression, as if I stepped out, throwing aside a cloak, lying in bed, looking at the stars, those nights at Monks House. Of course it rufflesâ , in the day but there it is. There it was yesterday when old Hugh came & said nothing about The Years. He has grown fatter, coarser. I did not feel him so genial: a little vulgarised I think by Hollywood. Isherwood came. We chattered, about the Royal family: Hugh is to report the Coronation for the Daily Mail, & will get Â£200 for 2,000 words. Then he told us the true story of Frank Vosper & Mr Willesâ€”sodomyâ€”a sudden impulseâ€”over the ships side: how his face grew; he was afraid of being a monstrosity. This is what I milk Hugh for. But his stories will get a little battered. He has Mr Davidson, the parson in the barrel to lunch calling. Not much real interest in human nature in Hugh. Always something irking him. Still the party went very briskly, & when it was over I walked round the Square, the first summer evening walk, & admired our patriotic beds of red, white & blue hyacinths. We go to France in May.
