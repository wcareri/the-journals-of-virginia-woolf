### Sunday 20 June

An odd thought strikes me, now that I think so much of conduct &c. (for 3 Gs). Why does one secretly desire the misfortunes of oneâ€™s friends? It is a cold grey day, & secretly Iâ€™m pleased that the Bells are at Charleston & we in London: I mean Iâ€™m glad that they should have a bad week end. Yet this kind of gladness is not so pleasant as the other. But after splitting meanings in my Congreve, I dont take this page in order to continue.

I have turned on my electric fireâ€”now the sunâ€™s out. Willie is upstairs, & Mabel comes in to say, shall she buy sausages? Iâ€™m rather cross, since I had hoped to have one unravished day. Cant get on with my 4 Congreve plays. Last evening Ann Watkins forced her way in: offered meâ€”I could see the bait put on the hookâ€”Â£1000 & all expenses if I wd. go to USA & lecture 3 times weekly for 3 months. What about I asked. That they didnâ€™t mind. The more personal the better: for instance, about my experience of publishing, bringing in my marriageâ€”a happy one. At this, your husband, who is sitting in the audience, will cry BOO! Well we declined. I was to repeat the same lectureâ€”not to read it, but to speak it. That was very important. And Aldous & Gerald Heard, those apostles of the inner life & peace & goodness, are touring the States doing this in duet. Lord lord! what an example for the Soul â€¦ & what a good quote for my book. I was amused by her perfectly frank commercialism. Moneyâ€”moneyâ€”money. Couldnt help liking herâ€”so fat, so coarse, like a bathing woman still touseled & blowsy from the sea. â€œIâ€™ve had a chequered careerâ€ she said. And told us how she had lectured to â€œnice young women â€¦ when I wasnâ€™t one at all myselfâ€ she said. No: I dont think sheâ€™ll even be able to sell my stories for me. What they want & Don Brace wants is that I should come over & exhibit my person, & make money for Don & for Ann. And what would they spend the proceeds of my personality on? Drink I should say, looking at Annâ€™s cheeks. Don would presumably buy his daughter a new dress. And I dont want a thousand myself, if I pay for it by hearing a gramophone forever braying in my head. She was honestly disappointed; & I cdnâ€™t finish my Congreve. And must now write & thank Margaret Keynes for a nice trusty old world letter about The Years.

I must add, we are waiting for Sally to give birth: so havent gone away: but is she even pregnant? L. asks again & again. He has made her a bed behind screens in his study. But she leaps & laughs.
