### Sunday 10 January

Another windless perfectly brilliant day. And Tommie is dead & buried yesterday, just as Clive was saying that no one had died lately. Also thereâ€™s Tonks dead in Chelsea. But Tommieâ€™s death is a queer piece of work. We said on the whole perhaps it was a good thing, because for the past 3 or 4 years we had scarcely seen him: when we did he seemed ravaged by his own misery; couldnâ€™t work, had been a failure; tore everyone & everything to bits in a kind of egotistic rage. Rosamund L. said he would sit on the lawn there by the hour denouncing women, complaining of his own lot. And he had grown immensely fat, white unwholesome looking, & was said to drink.

Duncan said he spent most of his time in the public houses near Tottenham Court Road, drinking. And Julia said no one could live with him, though she loved him. Everybody said one thing or another, as if he had cocked a snook at them & gone off. My own intercourse with him broke over that bust, when I took a shudder at the impact of his neurotic clinging persistency, & perhaps behaved, though I didnâ€™t think so at the time, unreasonably, perversely. But he was such an egotist; such a man for confiding, & getting wound up in the miserable intricacies of his own psychology. I remember his launching out on the history of his own suffering, which began, of course, with his mother & father, misunderstanding him as a child. Then there was Garrowâ€™s death; then the difficulties with Julia; how she fell in love with someone; how he still loved her. But the odd thing was that he had, years ago, great sensibility; a human charm, & sympathyâ€”for instance when Duncan was ill at Cassisâ€”I remember how he came into the drawing room at 37 with his arms open: Nessa kissing him in tears. And then when Carrington killed herself he came round that evening to break the news so that I shouldnâ€™t get the shock first hand. Yes. I remember his curious squashed face, his suppleness, something eager & friendly & warm, quivering about him. Here he sat in the drawing room, when we lit the stove for the first time & the room was full of smoke: & he talked about me then: my work; not himself. He was extremely loquacious. Anything set him off. And he had a great gift for making people love him: Angus, Eddy, Barbara. But there was something twisted, deformed in him: some shudder & profound distaste, & uneasiness. Lately he had tried, I think, living alone in the country; didnâ€™t like it; used to haunt public houses; deserted the respectable. N. & D. say they hadnâ€™t seen him for a long time. And then he catches some germ, goes to a nursing home in Boscombe, from the Johns where he was staying; the only person he wanted to see was Oliver: & so died aged 35. A tragic, wasted life: something wrong in it; & wrong that we shouldnâ€™t feel it more Yet one does, by fits & starts, this very fine spring morning.

Adrian, who rang up, said it was a very good thing his death. That he was in a hopeless state. He had not heard of the death, only had overheard someone say â€œPoor Tommieâ€.

I have scribbâ led this down, because it is an off morning. I am trying to screw myself to send an article to the N.S. on fishing. My Gibbon wants polishing; & Iâ€™ve got out of the mood. So let me go on to Elizabeth Robins & Octavia Wilberforce, before Quentin & Angelica come to our last roast turkey. They live in one of those rounded houses in Brightonâ€”Montpelier Crescentâ€”a shaped crescent; a solid, clean, rather unsophisticated house. Miss R. sat alone in her own room, a back room, with well polished tables, rather solid books, covers on things, a sketch of W. Wilberforce over the fire; a large coal fire; everything spick & span; documents on the writing table; as if she had good housemaids. She is old, but gnarled. Her face is perhaps slightly rouged, but crinkled. Her hair is curled & grizzled. Her eyes L. said, a faunâ€™s eyes: very intense: suddenly intensifying, like an actresses. All her movements angular, intense, grown rather rigid. She examined us, very tensely, but compactly, about her book. And Lord knows if we told the truth, or if it was any good what we said, for she is past her prime; but has had an interesting highly charged past evidently; she held much in reserve. I suspect she has had a great many emotional & physical experiences, which have crystallised into packed & solid views; on life, on religion, or rather the dislike of religion; on work, on sex. She was launching into a panegyric, very tense too & stylised, upon O.W: when in she cameâ€”a very fresh coloured healthy minded doctor, in black, with loops of silver chain, good teeth, & a candid kind smile which I liked. Opposite my plate she had put a little china statue of W.Wâ ilberforce: opposite L.â€™s another of Hannah More. This led usâ€”she & meâ€”to discuss our, I think mythical, relationship: from that we slipped to educationâ€”she had none: to familiesâ€”she had 9 in family; & they coerced her, though unwanted, through pressure of antiquated family feeling & propriety, to stay at home. Only through a great struggle did she break off & become a doctor. People in Brighton, where she has practised for 13 years, play Bridge sometimes 6 or 7 hours a day; dont have children; their husbands go to London to work in offices. They sometimes take a driveâ€”& so on. I had the flushed & exuberant feeling which means I liked being there & talking & we broached many scraps of memories. How father asked E.R. to come when he gave his Forgotten Benefactors talk. â€œBut I couldnâ€™t say what it made me feelâ€¦. It was tremendous. Very courageous of him. I couldnâ€™t think how he had the courage. No I could never say what I felt about that speechâ€. So she clips & cuts off. And about 7 we went out into the dark crescent, & I thought, Now what are they saying about us? & hoped I had made a good impression. O. said I must have great knowledge of other peoples lives to write A R. of O. That pleased me, having read that morning something about my â€˜lyrical emptinessâ€™. Oh but Iâ€™m going to think of Cleopatraâ€™s Needle when I get on to my old nightmare: & so canter past it. I think I can too. And L. is giving Sally a run after her bath: I must go & work in this extraordinary hot spring morning. Work, work, workâ€”thats my final prescriptionâ€”so have written to Richmond.
