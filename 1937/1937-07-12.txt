### Monday 12 July

To stop myself from thinking about 3 Gs. I will chatter here. A cold July: a grey skylight. Alone with Nessa in the studio last night. We are very gingerly in our remarks about Julian, & Madrid, I notice; but she begins to discuss politics. Always I feel the immeasurable despair just on tother side of the grass plot on wh. we walkâ€”on wh. Iâ€™m walking with such energy & delight at the moment. The reaction from last summer years 9 months gloom & despair I suppose.

I went to Stoke Newington yesterday & found a study table in white stone on wh. James Stephen was carved, large & plain, as I suspect he was large & plain. A long inscription about Wilberforce & wife & family neatly filled with green moss on top of the study table. Next door to the old Church, which might be in a hollow under the downs, is Clissold Park, & one of those white pillared houses in which Grandpapa studied The Times while She cut rosesâ€”now it smelt of Clissold Park mothers; & cakes & tea; the smellâ€”unpleasant to the noseâ€”of democracy. Clissold Park runs to greyhounds, unlike Hyde Park. There is a stag, & some say a Kangaroo. I was much refreshed by all this.
