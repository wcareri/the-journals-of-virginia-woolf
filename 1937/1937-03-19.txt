### Friday 19 March

Now this is one of the strangest of my experiencesâ€”â€˜theyâ€™ say almost universally that The Years is a masterpiece. The Times says so. Bunny. &: Howard Spring: If somebody had told me I shd. write this, even a week ago, let alone 6 months ago, I shd. have given a jump like a shot hare. How entirely & absolutely incredible it would have been! The praise chorus began yesterday: by the way I was walking in Covent Garden & found St Pauls, CG for the first time, heard the old char singing as she cleaned the chairs in the ante hall; then went to Burnets: chose stuff; bought the E. Standard & found myself glorified as I read it in the Tube. A calm quiet feeling, glory: & Iâ€™m so steeled now I dont think the flutter will much worry me. Now I must begin again on 3 Gs.

Hensman is now come, I supposeâ€”not that Iâ€™m much upset by that: as I dont seriously think this irritation matters. At the same moment, Miss Strachan has broken out into spots. L. suggests fleas. I heard him describing fleas just now in the Press. I have toiled a little at 3 Gs. but cant concentrate sufficiently: fly up into easy flights, because Iâ€™m praised no doubt.

Yesterday at Haywardâ€™s we heard a strange story. He lives in Bina Gardens, called Bina from Rubina, the builders favourite daughter. He sits askew in a 3 cornered chair. Cant get up. His room is an uncreative room: spick & span: too tidy. Carrington painted him a book case: the books all ranged in sizes. 2 glass horses on the Victorian mahogany table: flowers separately springing: a dish of carefully arranged fruit. The story was about his landlord: in prison for writing indecent letters to the girls at Roedeanâ€”addressed To the Head Girlâ€”therefore opened by the headmistress. These he concocted in the kitchen while Mrs Baker? cooked Johnâ€™s dinner. He interviewed all the lodgers & stated the facts. He liked telling this: partly to impress me, I think; & give a kick at Dryden & editing. Wont see more of the spring he said than Walls Ice Cream van. Has a great thick soft red lip: frozen green eyes; & angular attitudes like a monkey on a string. Said how Tom gave it as his opinion that Anglo Catholics may not, owing to Church Law, use contraceptives. Hence the indecent letters, I suppose. Another feather in the cap of Tomâ€™s Church. Now I must creep upstairs to see if Hensmans gone. My treat is to go to the Caledonian market.
