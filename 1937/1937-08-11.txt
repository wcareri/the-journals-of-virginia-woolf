### Wednesday 11 August

I have half an hour over, & may as well spend it here. â€˜Hereâ€™ I always write about writing: Iâ€™m rather ashamed. But its to set a flame to the effort & the grind of the day this summer. Now we are in the worst of the timeâ€”I think I can recognise that. We dont talk so freely of Julian. We want to make things go on. Angelica & Q. come over to play bowls. We beat up talk. Its unreal. We provide amusement, L. & I: this makes us rather quarrelsome when weâ€™re aloneâ€”the strain I suppose. The unbecoming stage of sorrow. And we are never alone. Graham on Saturday: Mrs W. & Ada on Sunday: the children: on Monday I went by train to Charleston. Thus I left L. alone: have I the right to leave L. alone, & sit with Nessa? She was again in the submerged mood. An atmosphere of deep grey waters; & I flopping like a dilapidated fish on top. Very hard work. Then Aâ  came to sleep & yesterday was an odious London day. L. silent; house grimy; waking up: heat; heavy rough, burnt up heat. A. late; tea; drive back: great thunderstorm, dine at Câ . Nessa better. But now begins the visitor crises, so bothering this summer. Are the Maurons coming? Then Judith & Adrian. I hate these decisions, & L. is silent. So I write here, not about this, but about my writing, which is the only flame the day strikes. Actually Iâ€™m offered Â£200 for 1,500 words in the Cosmopolitan. Shall I, shant I? Why make money? Another car, I suppose; another table; some new records & a dress. Familiar tune: Nessaâ€™s children; my envy of them, leading to work. But no use in thinkingâ€”I mean in analysis. I shall have a long walk this afternoon, to Piddinghoe: walk myself serene; play bowls, read; & not think of little arrangements; I bought a 6d. Jeans on the Mysterious Universe: Iâ€™m reading George Sand quietly; a long novel that L. thinks good carefully for the Press: shd. read Congreve to complete my study, but have had no timeâ€”only got back from Charleston late. Have Auden McNeice in Iceland from The Times; also some French George Sand memoirs. So I can browse along. And a huge box of Rogerâ€™s articles. Endless unwritten lettersâ€”sympathy about Julian who stalks beside me, in many different shapes.
