### Tuesday 12 October

London.

Yes we are back at Tavistock Square; & Iâ€™ve never written a word since Sept. 27th. That shows how every morning was crammed to the margin with 3 Guineas. This is the first morning I write, because at 12, ten minutes ago I wrote what I think is the last page of 3 Gs. Oh how violently I have been galloping through these mornings! It has pressed & spurted out of me, if thats any proof of virtue, like a physical volcano. And my brain feels cool & quiet after the expulsion. Iâ€™ve had it sizzling now sinceâ€”well I was thinking of it at Delphi I remember. And then I forced myself to put it into fiction first. No, the fiction came first. The Years. And how I held myself back, all through the terrible depression, & refused, save for some frantic notes, to tap it until The Yearsâ€”that awful burdenâ€”was off me. So that I have deserved this gallop. And taken time & thought too. But whether it is good or bad how can I tell? I must now add the bibliography & notes. And have a weeks respite. This may be provided by Mr Davis of Harpers Bazaar, coming to tea today to discuss a story suggested by that maroon coloured sharper, as we suspect him, M. Chambrunâ€”whom I have not describedâ€”the agent who cabled about the Duchess & the Jeweller, offered Â£200, & I think will somehow wriggle out. So nothing was said here of the last weeks at Monks House. The weather was very fine. That objective statement sounds a little odd. Nessa went to Paris. Last night she came here, for the first time. We have the materials for happiness, but no happiness. All this summer, I find myself saying that verse, Lowellâ€™s, about those whose coming steps we listen for: the verse about the nephew killed in the war. When Thoby died I used to walk about London saying to myself Stevensonâ€™s verses: You alone have crossed the melancholy stream. Both doggerel I suppose: yet they say themselves spontaneously. With Thoby though I felt we were the same age. With Julian it is the old woman, saying that she wont see the young again. It is an unnatural death, his. I cant make it fit in anywhere. Perhaps because he was killed, violently. I can do nothing with the experience yet. It seems still emptiness: the sight of Nessa bleeding: how we watch: nothing to be done. But whats odd is I cant notice, or describe. Of course I have forced myself to drive ahead with the book. But the future without Julian is cut off. lopped: deformed.

We have decided, gradually, completely, not to sell the Press; but to let it die off, saving for our own books. This is a good conclusion I think. It keeps the right to adventure; cuts off some money. We cd not face writing for publishers. Thus I carry out my own theories anyhow. And we get fresh scope for experiment & freedom.
