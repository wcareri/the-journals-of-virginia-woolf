### Thursday 29 April

L. is talking about stock. â€œThis oughtnâ€™t to be here at all.. I have just done my BBC. Never again never again: â€œSomebody hasnt checked it properlyâ€ Well, weâ€™ve decided to let the H.P. lapse or change next June. Yes I think, owing to Miss Langâ eâ€™â s incompetency, that is now definite. Many things have happenedâ€”a crowd of little engagementsâ€”the pleasantest, indeed a happy one, was the Memoir Club meeting. We dined in a kind of sitting room behind the Etoileâ€”& soon kindled, though it was a wet night: Dâ uncan had a cold; Bunny the whooping cough; & Morgan dined with Forrest Reid. But Desmond was babbling as a nightingaleâ€”never have I known him in such jubilant good temper as this year. As if he worked only to enjoy to radiate. And my thimble of vanity was filled instantly because Maynard said my Gibbon was 20 times better than anyone elses; & praised The Yearsâ€”a lovely book: & D. said he is going to write a long essay on me altogether, (but he wont) And then Molly & I kissed; & Maynard suggested that D. should give the L.S. lecture on L.S.: & we had a nice slice of savoury meat; & so round to the Studio. D. read a good account of his adventure at Florence, when he misrepresented Maynard. And then old Desmond â€˜obligedâ€™. That is he had a few notes in his hand, took a comfortable chair, & gave us with perfect ease & fluency & form a character of Wilfred Blunt & his own shooting. & so to the Trevelyansâ€”how Sir G.O. came hopping loping like a great gorilla across the wood in the middle of the shoot to say Alfred Lyallâ€™s poems are as near poetry as anything I can stand. Oh but it was beautifully doneâ€”& stopped when it might have gone on without boring us. Then Morgan read his condemned introduction to the Lawrence letters, which Bunny is now to do. And then we went off in the rain. Desmond said Weâ€™re not a day older, & we enjoy our society as much as we ever did. And Morgan said I felt so fond of everyone, I almost weptâ€”I think he said that. Anyhow, it was a great success; & no nonsense about it.

Yesterday oh how Margery Fry snubbed me, by announcing, as she came into the room, that the reviews of The Y. had been so sniffy she was afraid it must have influenced the sales. This was said exactly as Dora Sanger says things. But I had hold of myself, & got some sparks out of her & then David & Rachel came, & I had the best bath of understanding praise yet had: D. said The Ys had helped him more than any book he had read; & was profoundly human, moving, & a triumph. & R. chimed in with perspicacious quotation. And I kindled & thought it genuine. BBC tonight: have put off the supper party & shall get through no doubt tolerably. I rested my brain on Lotta Leaf last night, so slept & am freshened.
