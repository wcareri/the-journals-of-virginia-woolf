### Tuesday 25 May

These are the rough and rapid chronicles of our last French voyage which to fill this distracted morning I will try to copy here. For example: the first vines are to be seen at La Chemille; that is on Sunday the 8th May 1937, driving from Dieppe on a fairly fine morning. Also the road ahead looked like a white steeple. Then at Uzerche where we stayed we saw a woman sewing a white cloth on the banks of the river. She called the cows which obeyed. The river had a fresh lip. The flowers were like an Elizabethan meadow. A man chopped wood in the wood above. I could hear the hollow sounds. No other sound. And a boy showed us the way, opening the door of a great barn. Also that day we punctured and the man at the garage, talking about Mitz who was always our introduction to humanity, said how heâ€™d been in Gambia, and longed to be there not in this dead alive French village; where his wifes parents made him live.

So to Souillac. There it became two hundred years ago. There we sat on the banks of the Dordogne in the evening and saw the man in the great hat and gaiters, and women washing clothes on the shingle. There was a cabin built against the rock like a scene in a play; and a man sitting there while the women went in and out. All this I said happened two hundred years ago. The castle was Cromwell Road; but had a chapel and soft brown roofed barns. Roofs here like high felt hats pulled down with a dent in the middle. Chapel reminded me of times of Rousseau. Man went fishing. Peasants employed perhaps By the great house. Sudden violent stormâ€”as usual. Climate here â€˜temperamentalâ€™.

The perfect day.â€”Mayâ€”I forget what. Hot. To the Caves. The brownish red tracings of prehistoric animals half rubbed out by children who used to play here, until someone from Paris came and looked for these pictures. All this country very classical with its poplars in straight decorous groves; and the hills beyond. Then I had a bad time in an antiquity shopâ€”very nasty people the old furniture sellers everywhere. Liars and spiders catching tourists. Had to buy a five shilling plate to be quit and not popular at that. The cupboards only cost Â£3 but couldnt be sent. Man did bad drawings of Paris lifeâ€”youthful memories, stupid and imitative. The vanity of an artist and the avarice of a peasant. But I saw their bedroom which interested me. W.C. opening out of it. Then it became very hot. A town crier went round Souillac beating a drum announcing a play by Loti. Both were upset from eating truffle perhaps. Great day at Meyronne, where I wish to liveâ€”up in the castle. An old woman shredding salsify. Talked about wild boarsâ€”sometimes killed; quite tame; they eat them. Church full of flowers for the PentecÃ´te. The farm with the great pigeon house; all these old things not preserved but used and allowed to fall into decay.

Sunday was the fÃªte. People in bright clothes. Villages full of black men, standing about. The lady like the Princesse Lointaine going into the ruins. Farm carts in the cloister. A little girl who lived in the cloister and caught snails for Mitz. On 17th May I was thinking about action; how far directed or dictated by publicity motives, therefore largely impure, while we took in petrol at Villefranches: on road to Albi. Cold cloudy day. Left Souillac in a state of wild distraction. Madame like Sibyl C. at a party, doing accounts, answering questions about cheese, about bills, &c. Umbrellas open on the Place; people dining out there. Very bad dinner owing to crowd the night of the feast. At last the diners were so many we got up and left. Bank Holiday in France. Then to Najacâ€”sordidly medieval; bossed; with great beams; and muffled grinning heads; round a mediaeval fountain. No place for human beings to live inâ€”the middle ages. Houses perched on top of cliff. River flattened out beneath. An unreal dead crawling quiet, as if they were inhabiting an old shell. The old men gossiping with their pointed walking sticks. No life; no shops; dirt and misery. Albi on a very wet bank holiday. A flashy hotel; circle of blue and red electric light in the hall which went in and out. Bad dinner. The worst hotel yet found. Walked in the rain. Cathedral magnificentâ€”like factory in red: firm, fluted, rock-like, painted within. And so on. Rain all night. Room thick with dust. Walls stainedâ€”bugs possible. Off to Rodez now in a northern hill country. Houses changing. Still the helmets.

At Rodez the best hotel in the world. Spirits sprung up. A long walk after tea. Sat and looked at the mountains, over the very green flat nightingale valley. No Coronation movies. Reading Elle et Lui, a very good best seller. Cant stop reading. They say May is always stormy. Oh a very fine rust red cathedral at Rodez. In a valleyâ€”I suppose, stopping for petrol. The Dordogne running through a meadow; very steep green brushed hills; mob headed trees. Cold and grey.

Reading Beckford by Chapmanâ€”but why write about this cold egotist? this nugatory man? A chirp of birds and grass hoppers. Aurillac first class hotel. Dinner of character; fried eggs, ham and rice. Choc, cream with biscuits floating. Aubergines with chopped bacon and gravy; also stuffed with cheese dressing. Am forgetting English words like artichoke. Rather a dirty sky. Now on to Toulle.

Cold, cold and wet; slept in the village of Treysacâ€”but how do you spell it? Went walking to the top of the mountain to find the druid stones; all drenched green under trees; cuckoo calling; a little shepherds farm; rain coming down in full flood; as we went up following arrows, paths twisting; divine views all misted and shrouded; green lit. Had to stop, wet to skin, plod back; change; dine for 2/-; but left hungry, so to bed; no chairs; clean little place, should be seen again so lovely was it even then; still rainingâ€”now we are driving to Gueret and now I am thinking about 4 dimensional character: different aspects to be givenâ€”not the one personal intensity. But what on earth do I mean? Not I hope to excuse my own limitations; see Desmond in Sunday Times; who as usual depresses me beyond reason. Conversation at Vallensay about Talleyrand. D. of Valensay. No heâ€™s not very good, not very bad. Has no children, divorcedâ€”his wife was an American. Mlle Worthâ€”some such name. Comes here. Keeps birds, zebras for his pleasure; has a hotel at Paris. But you should see his zebras. Great nephew of the great Talleyrand. Very rich.

Lost spectacles at Beaugencyâ€”the perfect town on the Loire. Maintenon 50 miles from Paris; old claws of ruin against the bright evening sky after dinner. Birds singing; many nightingales, very fine and pure. All silent and unspoilt. But this has rapidly changed. 50 miles an hour. Câ€™est un oustitiâ€”un petit singe. Est-ce quâ€™il est dangereux? The same talk weâ€™ve had at every town: shows the poverty of the human race. Blazing hot taking in petrol. Lunch Rouen in a sq. off the Cathedral. No salt, the English say. I give them salt. Now petrol running out. Hot sun, but this Brighton Road empty, flat, uninhabited. Boudanville 8k. Le Havre 73k. Mitz here gave her last representation as I hope. Last petrol taken. Anxious about Maynard to the extent of dreading post or buying a paper. Old wounds twinging. Still a very good end to journey. No bad news of Maynard at Dieppe; a good hotel the Rhine; man who talked fluently and intelligently after dinner about South Africa; mines; diamondsâ€”how different from rubies; about fish; about soles and the French taking fish from Grimsby; about cooking; his wife used to cook; now lives at residential hotel; a biologist; round; chubby; spry; very objective and interesting about facts; would like to talk to innumerable people in hotels about their jobs. Night boat; calm sea; arrive at Newhaven; the Customs find cigars in the other car; pass us; we breakfasted at the Bridge Inn; on eggs and bacon; so to M.H. all very private and quiet; and glad of chairs and intimacy and the garden lush with grass and fruit trees not standing the comparison at all badly. Sally jumped at L.; deserted Percy. Now to London for two days and another week here.
