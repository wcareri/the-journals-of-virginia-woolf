### Monday 25 October

A terrific gale this week end. We went to Cuckmere, via Seaford; The sea over the front: great spray fountain bursting to my joy over the parade & the lighthouse. Right over the car. Then we walked down to the sea at Cuckmere; the birds came up like shots out of a catapult. We cd. not stand against the wind, the breath pressed out of us; nor see. We stood behind a shed, & watched the waves: a yellow rough light on them; pounding; a great curled volume roughened of water. Why does one like the frantic the unmastered? And the brooks streaked with white & blue lines; where the wind I suppose raised a long streak of drops. Also the drops were like the spurt made by a stone fallingâ€”shaped something like pinched up glass. The light over the marsh steel blue & tawny.

So to Charleston, wet & soaking. Saw Q. & Kapp as dry & merry as sandhoppers, & so bought muffins, toasted them, had tea; & a tree fell in Princes gap on top of Bannisterâ€™s lorry. Also the branch fell in the churchyard over the vegetables.

A meeting on Friday: Mr Hancock, Lyons &c. The new garden ready, save for the basins still to be embedded. The view is now clear through the walled garden to the down. Talk of Drawbell building: also building at Knotts Bushesâ€”my Tristramâ€™s Grove.
