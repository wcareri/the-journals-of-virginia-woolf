The communist press began its little snigger yesterday. John Brophy in D.T. a tired anaemic middle class book. So be it. That sneer is already rubbed out. But Iâ€™m too jaded to tackle the Professional chapter of 3 Gs. so write here. Yesterday we had Buxton to lunch, who had never heard of me or my agonies; & then I fetched my new lustre, & walked in the rain all across Hyde Park, now pink with coronation seats. This morning Austen Chamberlain is dead, & its an off day for me. No reviews I hope. L.â€™s irritation bad; will go to Hensman. No I cant write; & think shall I look at my Gibbon? Very wisely I have kept the week empty: save for the persistent Hayward tomorrow. But we know that the Spectator is giving a whole page to The Years: that the E. Standard is giving 2 columns: Desmond promises 2 cols on Sunday: & theres the NS. on Fridayâ€”so my peace is only that of a grasshopper under a leaf. No, I dont seriously fidget any more; because its plain there are 2 lines of criticism: one the Communist; the other the free mind. Had there been only the one, I shd. have been damned. As it is Iâ€™m discussed (as usual) & no one has yet seen the pointâ€”my point.
