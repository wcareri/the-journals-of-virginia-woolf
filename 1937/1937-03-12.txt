### Friday 12 March

Oh the relief! L. brought the Lit Sup to me in bed & said Its quite good. And so it is; & T. & Tide says Iâ€™m a firstrate novelist & a great lyrical poet. And I can already hardly read through the reviews: but feel a little dazed, to think then its not nonsense; it does make an effect. Yet of course not in the least the effect I meant. But now, my dear, after all that agony, Iâ€™m free, whole; round. Can go full ahead. And so stop this cry of content; sober joy. Off to MH. Julian back today.

I use my last 5 minutes before lunch to note that though I have slipped the gall & fret & despair even of the past few weeks wholly today, & shanâ€™t I think renew them; I have once more loaded myself with the strain of 3 Gs. at which I have been writing hard & laboriously. So now Iâ€™m straining to draw that cart across the rough ground. It seems therefore that there is no rest; no sense of Its finished. One always harnesses oneself by instinct; & cant live without the strain. Now The Years will completely die out from my mind.

Car mended. But rain pouring.
