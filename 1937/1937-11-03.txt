### Wednesday 3 November

Yes, I did get out of it: much to my regret next morning when I read that the deputation had been received by the PM in the Cabinet room at Downing Street. What a chance of â€œseeingâ€ to have missed! But I had the sense to weigh my own peace over the fire with a book; & my freshness the next morning which sped me through the revision. So I cry quits.

To Southwark & Lambeth, walking, yesterday. A great autumn for long City walks this. I discovered St James Garlick hill: & St Maryâ€™s Lambeth. A quiet day. Missed seeing David Cecil too. On the other hand Rosemary Hodgson rang up fr. The Daily Express to ask me to write a signed article. Its your name they wantâ€”& shant have. L. is writing a strong Letter to the Listener who cut his phrase about privaciesâ .
