### Tuesday 30 March

No good playing Schubert if one thinks L. minds the noise. And I dont really want it either. Cold grey dayâ€”reading rather better todays over the fire. Yesterday I walked to the Bridge & back over the hanger. This is a Gilbert White word. Odd thing in White is the change of proportion. 1770 proportions. Thus the downs become majestic mountains; a tortoise as large as an elephant; an oak a forest &c. A very pleasing change, like a slow motion picture: a magnifyer of things. Everything six times its present size. Thats one of the great charms to us. Then the clear bell like sentences. Had no scientific instruments: only his eyes. Question when & how science suddenly developed. 18th Cent, practically middle ages.

Ethel rings up to say she has re-read Years, under Miss Hudsonâ€™s direction, & finds it no longer unintelligible, but superbâ€”How can this be true of any mind? Yet Iâ€™m a little relieved. For one thing it makes it unnecessary to argue. I shall accept. Also shows The Years has selling powerâ€”if Miss Hudson can spontaneously enjoy. Today our last of seclusion. Possible London post this evening. Q. to dine. L.P. meeting, I am resting my brain entirely till we go back. But Thursday will be a bit of a rubâ€”all the way to Minstead & back with the talk thrown in: but when oneâ€™s dying one must. Janet dying I mean. How strange to lie there calmly contemplating the distant but inevitable endâ€”& Emphie watching too. But I rather suspect she is happy in her quiet composed wayâ€”save for Emphieâ€”reading Wâ ordsworth & Meâ redith I expect, as she used, out of her carefully annotated copies. She read them with me in the Park at Firle 30 years ago I suppose.
