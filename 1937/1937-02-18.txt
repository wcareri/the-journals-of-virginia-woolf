### Thursday 18 February

I have now written for 3 weeks at 3 Guineas, & have done 38 pages. Now Iâ€™ve used up that vein momently & want a few days change. At what? Cant at the moment think. And a kind gentleman from the Motor Union has troubled my peace with a copy of the Saturday Review (USA) in which I am called a maker of films & laces; a sitter in shaded drawing rooms, & so on. Now I will use a few minutes to lay this demon. I am quite sure that the next lap of my life will be accompanied with whistlings & catcalls in this strain. If I live another 15 years & go on writing they will probably change their tune. The question I have now to settle is what â€˜attitudeâ€™ to adopt. This kind of sneer has an inhibiting effect for the moment. Of course reason tells me that it is the Proletarian growl trying to rationalise itself. But I must be quit of the need even of defending myself. I want to forge ahead, on my own lines. To do this I must always have a book or article on foot: except when we can escape, as I hope in June, to other settings. But in London where I am exposed all day & every day to criticism some plating of resolution is absolutely needed. And I think Iâ€™ve got it by the tip of the tailâ€”a new kind of indifference. I experiment with snubs & sneers. How little they matter in the sum! how little they count with other peopleâ€”how little the goodness or badness of my books affects the world. And there is the worldâ€”represented by picture galleries, the Caledonian Market, Gibbon, Nessa, going to MH., walking, planning new arrangements of the room, & always throwing my mind 2 or 3 miles ahead.

Stephen Spender came to tea & dinner the other day. Rather a beautiful if too conventionally poetic young man: sunk cheeks, large blue eyes, skin always burning; great enthusiasm, but now tempered, & rather metalled because, having married, his friend, the male, joined the F Legion, is fighting in Spain; Inez, who is political in the Oxford way only, sits at Brussels studying Spanish MSS. Stephen finds this intolerable. Why then did you marry, we asked, more or less. To stabilise himself; because he dreaded the old Brindled Tom puss life of William, safe by the fireside. Now is torn two ways: so Inez sits there, in order, should he be killed in Spainâ€”but heâ€™s only broadcastingâ€”she may have her job to fall back on. A curious interpretation of marriage, dictated by the guns. I like him: told him not to fight. He said it was the easiest thing to do. I said give up speakingâ€”he said But it brought in money. He argued that we cannot let the Fascists overrun Spain: then itâ€™ll be France; then us. We must fight. L. said he thought things had now gone so far it did not matter. Fighting did no good. S. said the C.P. which he had that day joined, wanted him to be killed, in order that there might be another Byron. He has a childâ€™s vanity about himself. Interesting to me at the moment, as Iâ€™m working out the psychology of vanity. Then he went to speak about Spain at the Friends House, & we to Uncle Vanya. A very cold night. I have left out my lunch with Christabel, & various other entertainments. Oh yes, Iâ€™m rather nervous about March 15 but can hold myself very much aloof. We were dining with the MacCarthys, but â€˜the eldest Miss Cornish died suddenly last night at St Georgeâ€™s Hospitalâ€”so she must put you offâ€™.
