### Monday 15 February

Oh it was heavenly driving down to Rodmell on Friday evening with that weight off us! I walked Harley Street up & down up & down for an hour; people looked at me; I bought a paper; dropped my handkerchief; always returned to the swing doors of 149. People kept on going in & out. & I hardly could make myself turn my back. At last just before 5 L. came in his new light overcoat, & smiled. Well he was quite composed. And the whole thing at once fell into different proportions. Graham thinks its only a case of diet: eats too great a whack of sugar; wdnâ€™t even examine him for diabetes; said nothing about prostate gland; found all organs very healthy; told him to continue eating as before until Hensman communicated. And L.â€™s symptoms are almost over. So as I say we drove down, in that odd relieved state which seems as much physical as mental; as if oneâ€™s body could unfurl; & become warm & sleepy. Got to MH. only at 7.30. had to dine hurriedly; Q. rang up to say his car had broken down. The meeting. N. Lyons sprightly & talkative; Q. came at 9.30; in gum boots wet through; had dinner at 10.30: went back over the downs in the rain. And over us brooded the same delicious ease & content, as if another space of life had been granted us.

On Sunday the O. had 2 little mildly appreciative notes about The Years; & I observed, with pleasure, that all praise & blame & talk about that book seems like tickling a rhinoceros with a feather. This is true; & remarkable. I connect it partly with my 1932 philosophic revelation: one doesnt matter: also with my present absorption in Three Guineas.
