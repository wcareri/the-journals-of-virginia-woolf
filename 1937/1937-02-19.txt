The difficulty wh. now faces me is how to find a public, a way of publishing, all the new ideas that are in me? Iâ€™ve written this morning 3 descriptions for Nessaâ€™s pictures: they can be printed by us no doubt, & somehow put into circulation. But then theres in my drawer several I think rather good sketches; & a chapter on biography. Clearly I have here in the egg a new method of writing criticism. I rather think so. I feel that I want some private way of producing these studies; these adumbrations. If one writes them for a paper the attitude changes. Theyre not Times articles or N.S. articles: yet I dont want to keep them till theyre books, or flutter them out separately â€¦ Lord knows. Anyhow I like the fruitful sense it gives me.

Yesterday Ethel Sands in black & silver fur to tea; early; had been to Eltham House: on top of her Eth Williamson, striding, masculine, shooting her linen as it used to be called. Ethel flitting by the rich dusk of high liberal life; full of swerving half sentences; betwixt & between. Talked of her own funeral: this was my private joke with herâ€”Then L. came & we talked about India. E. had been impressed by the Eng. Civilian: most of all by the rains: how the temp. fell, like this, she drew her finger along the table cloth. Then I forgetâ€”I flirted with old Ethel: about her golden wedding present. Nan used to know about water gilding. The Sinclairs see no danger ahead for England. One of her nephews thoâ€™ says this is his last winterâ€™s hunting. Eth has a telescope wh. she will sell us cheap. Off she went. Ethel stayed on. We discussed the young; catastrophe; she went, with the usual sweetness, to sit with Nan who has laryngitis. Mollyâ€™s sister scalded her foot & died of heart failure.
