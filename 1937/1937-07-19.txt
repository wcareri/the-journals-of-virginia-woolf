### Monday 19 July

Just back from MH. but I cant & wont write anythingâ€”too hithered & dithered. Also, I screwed my head tightâ€”too tightâ€”knocking together a little obituary of Janet for The Times. And couldnt make it take the folds well; too stiff & mannered. She died. Three notes from Emphie this morning. She died on Thursday, shut her eyes, â€œ& looks so beautifulâ€. Today they are cremating her, & she had had printed a little funeral serviceâ€”with the death day left blank. No words; an adagio from Beethoven, & a text about gentleness & faith, wh. I would have included had I known. But what does my writing matter? There is something fitting & complete about the memory of her, thus consummated. Dear old harum scarum Emphie will have her solitary moments to herself. To us she will always be a scatter brain; yet to me very touching, & I remember that phrase in her letter, how she ran into Janetâ€™s room at midnight, & they had a nice little time together. She was always running in. Janet was the steadfast comtemplative one, anchored in some private faith wh. didnâ€™t correspond with the worlds. But she was oddly inarticulate: no hand for words, her letters save that the last began â€œMy beloved Virginiaâ€ always cool & casual. And how I loved her, at Hyde Pk Gate; & how I went hot & cold going to Windmill Hill: & how great a visionary part she has played in my life, till the visionary became a part of the fictitious, not of the real life.

An august Sunday: I thought of the Forest lying green in the sun, & Janet dead. But I thoughtâ€”not much. Too hot & harrassed with fitting phrases. And I was badly beaten at bowls. The kitchen a great successâ€”now green & cool, & the new window shows a square of flowers; .. Why, all these years, I never thought to lay out Â£20 on a new cupboard, paint & window, I dont know. Last year of course I was carefully drawing my poor limp horns in. And now Elizabeth Bowen thinks The Yearsâ€”oh, all I wanted it to be. And Olaf Stapledon also, & so on. Iâ€™m now coming in for measured slow sound praiseâ€”a long article by Delattre pleased meâ€”my deepest & strongest bookâ€”so that I can discount old Ethel, who hedgesâ€”& Vita who never hedges, but takes great rough leaps over all subtleties. I am scribbling to avoid my Congreve: to avoid deciding whether to finish that off this last 10 days, or storm the last section of 3 Gs. Cant make up my mind.

On Friday we went to Worthing. Mrs W. very plaintive. Would even like to try Dr. Alexanderâ€”have I notedâ€”no I leave out all the interesting factsâ€”that L. is trembling less & lessâ€”can drink his coffee steadyâ€”& has, at 56, cured a disease that has, I guess, moulded his life wrongly since he was 5. All his shyness, his suffering from society, his sharpness, & definiteness, might have been smoothed. I mean by this something mostly superficial, but possibly constricting underneath also. Mrs. W however was plaintive, & Alice solid, like a large tree in shape, & Harold, the gayest of the Wolves, said, No one ought to live after 80. Like a good fellow he does his share & more of the necessary chatter. But has now bought a farm, in order to become a venerable & protected member of society, not a hated rentier. Then a meeting at MH. where the Major, who talks to mice, & holds toads in his hand, treated us to the most drivelling murmured muddle I ever heardâ€”about force, & religion, which is heredity, & I may say with your permission, what I mean is, its all a question of thinking isnt it, & you cant talk to a Spaniard, but you can to a Mahommedan, & thats what I feel, religionâ€™s at the back of it, & one has to take orders, as I see it, but Sir, if I may say so, its a question of heredityâ€”but I cant reproduce the shell shock Major; & cd. only keep from howling by fixing my eyes on a cigarette. L. summed up in a masterly flightâ€”thats what I mean: & so concluded. Q. & I were dumb.
