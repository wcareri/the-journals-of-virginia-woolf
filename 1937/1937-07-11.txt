### Sunday 11 July

A gap: not in life, but in comment. I have been in full flood every morning with 3 Gs. Whether I shall finish by August becomes doubtful. But I am in the middle of my magic bubble. Had I time I wd. like to describe the curious glance of the worldâ€”the pale disillusioned worldâ€”that I get so violently now & then, when the wall thinsâ€”either Iâ€™m tired or interrupted. Then I think of Julian near Madrid. & so on. Margaret Ll. Davies writes that Janet is dying, & will I write on her for The Timesâ€”a curious thought, rather: as if it mattered who wrote, or not. But this flooded me with the idea of Janet yesterday. I think writing, my writing, is a species of mediumship. I become the person. Then Society: Saxonâ€™s Club dinner: Old Sir Wm. & Beresford. And the Nefs, Sybil, Butts, Sartonâ€”so many faces. I cdnâ€™t face the Bussys, thoâ€™ I shd. have liked to meet Matisse, Pernel & the rest. But the clock strikes one.
