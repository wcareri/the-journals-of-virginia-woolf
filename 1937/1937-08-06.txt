### Friday 6 August

Monks House, Rodmell.

Well but one must make a beginning. Its odd that I can hardly bring myself, with all my verbosityâ€”the expression mania which is inborn in meâ€”to say anything about Julianâ€™s deathâ€”I mean about that last 10 days in London. But one must get into the current again. That was a complete break; almost a blank; like a blow on the head: a shrivelling up. Going round to 8 that night; & then all the other times, & sitting there. When Roger died I noticed: & blamed myself: yet it was a great relief I think. Here there was no relief. An incredible sufferingâ€”to watch itâ€”an accident, & someone bleeding. Then I thought the death of a child is childbirth again; sitting there listening.

No no, I will not go back to those days. The only thing was a kind of comfort in being there with Nessa Duncan, Quentin & Angelica, & losing completely the isolation, the spectatorâ€™s attitude in being wanted; & spontaneous. Then we came down here last Thursday; & the pressure being removed, one lived; but without much of a future. Thats one of the specific qualities of this deathâ€”how it brings close the immense vacancy, & our short little run into inanity. Now this is what I intend to combat. How? how make good what I protest, that I will not yield an inch or a fraction of an inch to nothingness, so long as something remains? Work of course. I plunged on Monday into Congreve, & have about done him this morning. And undoubtedly that sets the wheels running. Directly I am not working, or see the end in sight, then nothingness begins. I have to go over though every other day to Charleston. We sit in the studio door. It is very hot, happily. A hot bank holidayâ€”a child killed at the top; aeroplanes droning. The thought of Julian changing so queerly, no so usually: now distant, now close; now of him there, in the flesh; now some physical encounterâ€”kissing him surreptitiously: & so on. And then I had some relief when Tom rejected his essays, for I felt then I had not been merely spiteful, merely jealous. But how it curtails the future: how it reduces ones vision to ones own lifeâ€”save for Q. & Angelica. A curiously physical sense; as if one had been living in another body, which is removed, & all that living is ended. As usual, the remedy is to enter other lives, I suppose; & the old friction of the brain; but now I must sum up, & try to get my accounts, that is my plans for working, in being again.

Well, theres 3 Guineas to finish: the last chapter, now I suppose its stiff & cold. But I will try that tomorrow: then polish off Congreve: then earn Â£200, so they say, with a story: & so to Roger this autumn.

Will another novel ever swim up? If so, how? The only hint I have towards it is that its to be dialogue: & poetry: & prose; all quite distinct. No more long, closely written books. But I have no impulse; & shall wait; shant mind if the impulse never formulates; thoâ€™ I suspect one of these days I shall get that old rapture. I dont want to write more fiction. I want to explore a new criticism: One thing I think proved; I shall never write to â€˜pleaseâ€™ to convert; now am entirely & for ever my own mistress.

Rodker is nibbling at the Press. At the first nibble, through John, we both shied so strongly, that I suspect we shall end by reducing the Press to ourselves, & keeping it for ever, reduced. Rodker is a communist. Any other hand in the Press is suspect at once. Today we go to Charleston: Clive is in France with Janis; Duncan has been in London; Nessa is alone today. A very hot dayâ€”I add, to escape from the thought of her.

â€œI shall be cheerful, but I shall never be happy againâ€  
â€œI thought when Roger died that I was unhappyâ€”â€
