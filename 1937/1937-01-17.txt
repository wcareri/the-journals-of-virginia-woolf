### Sunday 17 January

Home again. Poor L. grumbling, making Mabel a peg on which to hang his misery oh dear. But rather a good evening all the same. Not a nice morning though: proofs; dust. How quiet London is however. Not a sound. I must make up my mind to work, & break through the enchanted circle of. First I must tidy up: throw away all the old Years litter get things clean & fresh. Lunch with Clive tomorrow to meet I dont know who. That great mystery rather amuses me. I think Jack Hills & Violet Dickinson. A great many MSS to read. I shall also go to the Nat Gall. & to the Zoo.
