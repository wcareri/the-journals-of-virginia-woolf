### Thursday 28 January

Sunk once more in the happy tumultuous dream: that is to say began 3 Guineas this morning, & cant stop thinking it. My plan is to write out now? without more palaver, & think perhaps it might be roughed in by Easter; but I shall allow myself, make myself, scribble a little article or two between whiles. Then I hope to float over the horrid March 15th: wire today to say Years havent reached America. I must plate myself against that sinking in mud. And so far as I can tell, this method is almost too effective.

L. seeing Miss Lange upstairs; dining with Hutchinsons to meet Wells; & now must rush up to lunch.
