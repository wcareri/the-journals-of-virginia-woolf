### Friday 22 January

Miss West died yesterday. And Miss Howlett reproaches Miss Bevan, ill at Worthing. And Miss Hepworth is now seeing L. about a job. It pours. Last night I turned Nessa to steel by talking about J.â€™s essay on Rogerâ€”a most curious transformation: as if some tigress lay in a cave, growling. Vita to lunch today. Polishing Gibbon. Will now I think do the A. Artists leafletâ€”& then? Oh some stuff for the NS?
