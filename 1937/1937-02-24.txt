### Wednesday 24 February

Dearest Virginia, I am back when you get this, alive Westminster: will you send word to 19 North Street when & where I can come & see you? 6 oâ€™clock or dine alone Sibyl â€¦ Paris. 12. 23.II.1937. This significant & illegible card has just been brought me by L. & I copy it as material for a memoir: raw matter to serve in writing the history of my own times: also to fill 5 minutes before luncheon. Iâ€™m off again, after 5 days lapse (writing Faces & Voices) on 3 Guineas; after a most dismal hacking got a little canter, & hope now to spin ahead. Odd that one sometimes does a transition quite quickly. A quiet day for a wonderâ€”no one seen yesterday: so I went to Caledonian market, cdnâ€™t find spoon shop; bought yellow gloves 3/- & stockings, 1/- & so home. Started reading French again: Misanthrope & Coletteâ€™s memoirs given me last summer by Janie: when I was in the dismal drowse & cdnâ€™t fix on that or anything.

Today the reviewers (oh dâ€”n this silly thought) have their teeth fixed in me; but what care I for a goosefeather bed &c. In fact, once I get into the canter over Three Gs. I think I shall see only the flash of the white rails & pound along to the goal.
