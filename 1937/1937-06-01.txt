Monks House.

I have at last got going with 3 Guineasâ€”after 5 days grind, re-copying & to some extent re-writing, my poor old brain hums againâ€”largely I think because I had a good long walk yesterday & so routed the drowseâ€”it was very hotâ€”At any rate I must use this page as a running groundâ€”for I cant screw all the 3 hours; I must relax & race here the last hour. Thats the worst of writingâ€”its waste. What can I do with the last hour of my morning? Dante again. But oh how my heart leaps up to think that never again shall I be harnessed to a long book. No. Always short ones in future. The long book still wont be altogether downedâ€”its reverâ bâ erations grumble. Did I sayâ€”no the London days were too tight, too hot, & distracted for this bookâ€”that H. Brace wrote & said they were happy to find that The Years is the best selling novel in America? This was confirmed by my place at the head of the list in the Herald Tribune. They have sold 25,000â€”my record, easily, (now I am dreaming of 3 Guineas) We think if we make money of buying perhaps an annuity. The great desirable is not to have to earn money by writing. I am doubtful if I shall ever write another novelâ€”Certainly not unless under great compulsion such as The Years imposed on me. were I another person, I would say to myself, Please write criticism; biography; invent a new form for both; also write some completely unformal fiction: short: & poetry: Fate has here a hand in it, for when Iâ€™ve done 3 Gsâ€”wh. I hope to have written, not yet for publication thoâ€™, in August, I intend to put the script aside, & write Roger. What I think best wd. be to work hard at 3 Gs for a monthâ€”June: then begin reading & rereading my Roger notes.

By the way, I have been sharply abused in Scrutiny, wh., L. says, calls me a cheat in The Waves & The Years; most intelligently (& highly) praised by Faulkner in Americaâ€”& thats all. (I mean thats all I need I think write about reviews now; I suspect the clever young man is going to enjoy downing meâ€”so be it: but in private Sally Graves & Stephen Spender approve: so, to sum up, I dont know, this is honest, where I stand; but intend to think no more of it. Gibbon was rejected by the N. Republic, so I shall send no more to America. Nor will I write articles at all except for the Lit Sup: for whom I am going now to do Congreve.)

It has been August hot; Nessa came over & we had a long natural gossip. Maynard has been very ill but is better. Must rest for 6 months. Duncan in France. We stay here for one weeks perfect solitude. Then a London season, very hectic I guess. I should make a note of Desmondâ€™s queer burst of intimacy the other evening. He came, was waiting, the evening we arrivedâ€”last Tuesday that is; read us his L. S. lecture, a rather laboured but honest but perfunctory lecture: after which he & I sitting in the twilight with the door open, L. coming in & out, discussed his shyness: he says he thinks it made him uncreative. Could he have told his intimate friends his private life it would (for some reason) have freed, enriched him. But he was shy; afraid of sinking in our opinion. Not surface shy of course; but heart shy. Reference to his mistresses. He then asked if I thought he had still power to write a good book. What could he do with his wretched stump of life? I said write your private thoughts, not autobiography. And tell us your private life. He said Oh yes, Iâ€™ll come & talk to you. And Iâ€™ll write it you. I felt something uneasy, trying to express itself; egotistical, weak I daresay. I think I see why he has been so fluent, so friendly, so embarrassingly anxious to be on some warmer footing, this last few months. Its his pressing need to write a good book somehow to assert himself before the stump of life is thrown on the fire. But how far am I sincere in thinking that he can? Isnt there a fatal softness, flabbiness; now gone too far? But how can one judge? Thats my noteâ€”not altogether satisfactory, & leaving it unshadedâ€”the picture of D. now in my mindâ€”my affection, my unintimate, but all the same genuine affection for him. He repudiated Maurice Baring orâ€”some titled lady I thinkâ€”as â€˜friendsâ€™. Said his most intimate friend was G. Moore: but was shy with him. Could not ask him that is, if he had found marriage disappointing. D. is decided that he has. Mrs M. a woman who will drag in education.

Lady Simon, too, another visitor those crowded days, will drag in education. She sent me a report, private, of the meeting at Newnham to discuss the great question if gowns should be worn. This is connected with the question, is it time to ask the Uâ niversity to admit us? And she says, next time, if ever, you are asked to lecture, please print your answer; her wish being that the question should be frankly & rashly posedâ€”by me, in default of Girton & Somerville. Well, perhaps, if I can bring off 3 Gs. But can I. Down hereâ€”now coldâ€”I scribble & traverse miles of argument as I walk through Tristrams Grove to Piddinghoe. Mr Gwynneâ€™s cows wear brown holland coats. Oh so hot yesterday: today the air splintered into arrows & the sun muffled & whitened. Mary H. asks me to dine to meet the Duff Coopers. Courage bids me say Yes. But my hair? & my dress?
