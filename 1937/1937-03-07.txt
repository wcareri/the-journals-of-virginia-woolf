### Sunday 7 March

As will be seen on the last page my spiritual temperature went up with a rush; why I dont know, save that Iâ€™ve been having a good gallop at 3 Guineas. Now I have broached the fatal week & must expect a sudden drop. Its going to be pretty bad, Iâ€™m certain; but at the same time I am convinced that the drop neednâ€™t be fatal; that is, the book may be damned, faint praise; but the point is that I myself know why its a failure, & that its failure is deliberate. I also know that I have reached my point of view, as writer, as being. As writer I am fitted out for another 2 booksâ€”3 Gs & Roger; (let alone articles); as being the interest & safety of my present life are unthrowable. This I have, honestly, proved this winter. Its not a gesture. And honestly the diminution of fame, that people arenâ€™t any longer enthusiastic, gives me the chance to observe quietly. Also I am in a position to hold myself aloof. I need never seek out anyone. In short either way Iâ€™m safe, & look forward, after the unavoidable tosses & tumbles of the next ten days, to a slow, dark, fruitful spring, summer & autumn.

This is set down I hope once & for all. And please to remember it on Friday when the reviews come in.

To Cockfosters yesterday, & saw the old tramp woman on the bank, lighting a damp fire & eating dry bread. I took What shall we do then in my pocket. A curious comment. Saw also the monument to the birth of George Earl Grey in 1702. Had buttered toast & jam & saw the girl going to the vicarage to rehearse a religious drama. Many people. Ethel Sands, Shaw Desmond. Eth Bowen. Miss Loeb at Cliveâ€™s.
