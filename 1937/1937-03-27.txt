No, I am not going to titivate Gibbonâ€”that is condense by a thousand words. Too much screw needed, & my brains unstrung. Merely scribbling here, over a log fire, on a cold but bright Easter morning; sudden shafts of sun, a scatter of snow on the hills early; sudden storms, ink black, octopus pouring, coming up; & the rooks fidgetting & pecking in the elm trees. As for the beauty, as I always say when I walk the terrace after breakfast, too much for one pair of eyes. Enough to float a whole population in happiness, if only they wd. look. Curiously a combination, this garden, with the Church, & the cross of the Church black against Asheham Hill. That is all the elements of the English brought together, accidentally. We came down on Thursday, packed in the rush in London; cars spinning all along the roads: yesterday at last perfect freedom from telephones, & reviews, & no one rang up. I began Lord Ormont & his Aminta, & found it so rich, so knotted, so alive, & muscular after the pale little fiction Iâ€™m used to, that, alas, it made me wish to write fiction again. Meredith underrated. I like his effort to escape plain prose. And he has humour & some insight tooâ€”more than they allow him now. Also Gibbon. And so Iâ€™m well fitted out; but cant write more than this without the old tightening & throbbing at the back of the head.
