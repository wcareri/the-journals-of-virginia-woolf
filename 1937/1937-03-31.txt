### Wednesday 31 March

Thank goodness, better today. Clear & stableâ€”at least Iâ€™m sunning myself on that ledge at the moment. But I will not write till Monday. A hot June morning. Little gummy noises under the trees as if buds were popping, twigs exploding. Rooks cawing. Trees still clear & coloured. Letters began last night. Lord Olivier. â€œBeing out of sorts & unable to tackle serious books I read The Yearsâ€â€”that sort of drivle. And the visitors beginningâ€”Hugh Walpole, Sally Graves party. Today a shifty apologetic letter from Sparrow asks me not to read his review, of wh heâ€™s not proud. L. says â€˜little swine ..â€™ Ethel engrossed by Dotty. So be it. Q. last night pleased me, praising The Y. as poetryâ€”like To the L the oddest novel heâ€™d ever read. A good meeting. Fenders & pokers brought by Mr Macer Wright. Louie enchanted. But cant write as the above shows. Hand wont hold pen.
