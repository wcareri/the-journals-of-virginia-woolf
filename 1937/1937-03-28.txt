### Sunday 28 March

Again I take my tiny little flutter, with the accursed Xtian bells ringingâ€”however, dulled as they are with 500 years or more at Rodmell I cant seriously dislike them. A June morning. A log fire & a June morning. No review by Desmond: so that sword hangs suspended. L. thinks heâ€™s jealous. I dont think thatâ€”suspect some perplexity. Q. rings up. L. will go to tea. I shant. I shall lapse into dreams. What luck if I cd. strike a good vein! Reading Othello was it once at Ashehamâ€”I remember sitting in the garden there, so sublime.

Yesterday a reporter for the N. York Times rang up: was told he cd. look at the outside of 52 if he chose. At 4.30 as I was boiling the kettle a huge black Daimler drew up. Then a dapper little man in a tweed coat appeared in the garden. I reached the sitting roomâ€”saw him standing there looking round. L. ignored him. L. in the orchard with Percy. Then I guessed. He had a green note book & stood looking about jotting things down. I ducked my headâ€”he almost caught me. At last L. turned & fronted him. No Mrs W. didnt want that kind of publicity. I raged. A bug walking over ones skinâ€”cdnâ€™t crush him. The bug taking note. L. politely led him back to his Daimler & his wife. But theyâ€™d had a nice run from Londonâ€”bugs, to come & steal in & take notes.
