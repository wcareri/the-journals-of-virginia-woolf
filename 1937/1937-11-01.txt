### Monday 1 November

A damp depressed morning. So why not write here? Pouring; vanity hurt by the preference given to Morgan by Day Lewis in the Book Society News. Why not V.W? Yes, thats the mean little worm that will nibble when I wake talk tired after yesterday. We went to Philipâ€™s for lunch. We had dined at the Hotelâ€”the 87th birthday party. So hot the clothes stuck to one. Abrahamson soliloquised. Most of the daughters in law munching like cows in a field. And poor Connie Ross in brown, with a trickle of ribbons, poised on an armchair like a much battered moth, the moth that has been attracted out of the even damper garden by the light & the noise. And we played whist. Then yesterday we went to Philipâ€™s; a soft warm late summer morning: stopped at Miltonâ€™s cottage. Persuaded the cultivated man to show us round. Babs said â€œWe want to consult you about Cecilâ€. The poor little boy wont say whats the matter. He takes no interest in anything. Wont turn & wave to her, or write to her; drudges on at Latin. Babs uninhibited. Simple. And the many ponies followed us round the garden. Not a happy family exactly. No high spirits. Attenuated critical children. Education weighing on Philip & Babs. A beautiful sweep of 18th century view.

So home. Wyndham Lewis Auby: hot mean reading. Exacerbates. Yet diminishes vitality. Thank God, it will be out of the house today. Dinner with Clive: Janis: Nessa, Angelica. I think poor old Clive even a little on the bare wheels; no blown up tires. That to me is very ominous if Cliveâ€™s spirits should give wayâ€”if he were to give up his enjoyment of life! We discussed education; dreams; N. & A. stitched at some private garment. A. alternately silent & decisive. Duncan came in. Not much boasting. I feel that N. has, with her bad eye, given up all hope of painting at the moment. She is querulous sometimes about my â€œsuccessâ€. When I told her the actual figuresâ€”40,000â€”she was, I think, relieved (as I shd. have been in her place) to find them less than reported.

An odds & ends evening, neither one thing nor another. I am revising the 1st Guinea: shall send them all off, to be typed: show to L.: then provide notes. But no more this morning. The Co-operative Press hangs: I think the young are eager to bite. Pepita begins to boom; also Sally Bowles. Dick Sheppard died at his desk yesterday; just elected Rector some where. A pity, I expect; if peace is a cause, he had some gift that way.

On Saturday I â€œsawâ€; by wh. I mean the sudden state when something moves one. Saw a man lying on the grass in Hyde Park. Newspapers spread round him to keep off the damp. A cheap attachÃ© case; & half a roll of bread. This moved me. So uncomplaining: a positive statement. He was asleep. Others lying near. The last time I â€˜sawâ€™ was at MH. last week end, when Louie was discussing the building at Knotts Bushes. My mother used to take us that way when we were children. She used to tell us how she walked from Telscombe to Newhaven to shopâ€”a vision of the little caravan, absolutely private silent, unknown, going over the downs, talking. Ought one only to write about what one â€œseesâ€ in this way? These sights always remain. Isherwood, now Christopher, & John, beg me to write a story for New Writing. A compliment. Suggestion: â€œPortrait of a Young manâ€ but Iâ€™m so fed up with short stories. Todays the day of the deputation to the H of C. But the PM has the gout. Must I go? Cant I get out of it?
