What a mercy to use this page to uncramp in! after squeezing drop by drop into my 17 minute BBC: wh. is alternately 25 & then 15 minutes. Curse the BBC. Also the N.S. They come pestering, & instead of lounging at MH. I made up an article on Gibbonâ€™s Aunts. Why? Partly because of pressure, unconscious, from Leonard. However, on the whole MH was a good week end. Very cold wind. Went to tea at Charleston; & there found the whole family for once. Unfortunately Julian is dog obstinate about driving an ambulance; which casts a shadow over Nessa, & us too. There heâ€™ll be keeping us all on the tenterhooksâ€”But it wont be for 2 months, & whatâ€™s the use of looking ahead? On Monday we drove, round London, deviously, through the half dead old villages, to Ickenham: where Sally was almost surgically mated; the after marriage taking over 20 minutes. L. & the stableman & Mr Lloyd assisted: I, prudently, & chastely sat in the car & showed Mitz to the children. Then home to find Vita waitingâ€”tomato red with one blue yellow eye: unconscious, easy & lazy as usual. We argued about Ethel. As she approached The Yearsâ€”might have been written by somebody elseâ€”no wild poetryâ€”in came L. to say Willie must have his tea. So that argument was scotched. She went off to Curtis Brown; then to her first night of the Edwardians at Richmond; then Julian came with my glass fish: & then at last unpacked the car, slept over the fire.

Summer time began on Sunday: & I look up & see my clock still an hour late.

These little articles ruin ones time; today spoilt because I must finish off the talk & send to The Listener. Never again. Yet of course thereâ€™s a certain thrill about writing to read aloudâ€”I expect a vicious one. And it could have been a good article. Its the talk element that upsets it. And in the pouring rain we went to Nessaâ€™s; saw the D. of Kent pass in his emblazoned car, & then bought some of Julianâ€™s Chinese pots.
