### Monday 8 March

What I noticed on the walk to Cockfosters were: the father mother & small boy: (to whom the school took off their caps, one said I gave her the glad eye) the father saying â€œIâ€™ve a large book waiting for youâ€ The son piping up â€œIâ€™ve got some stamps alreadyâ€â€”the father, â€œIâ€™ve torn off lots of stampsâ€ upon wh. I thought of L. if he had a son. Then the wall round the park; how we had to walk as the car is still broken, how at every gate or even fence there was a notice This is Private .. Private road: I thought how I cursed the possessors of great parks who made me walk along the road, shaved every second by a car or a lorry; then the tramps. It was a wet cold day: had been raining in the night; the grass border very damp. The middle aged woman was trying to make a fire: a man in townish clothes was lying on his side in the grass. Both had stupid coarse broad rather truculent faces, as if they wd fire off oaths if one spoke or even looked too long. When we came back after an hour the woman had got the fire to burn, & the man was sitting up, among some old clothes & bits of dirty paper; also I think a small perambulator of some sort. She was cutting a slice of bread off a loaf, but there was no butter. At night it became very cold, & as we sat down to our duck L. said he wondered how they sâ pent the night. I said probably they go to the workhouse. This fitted in with What shall we do then, wh. I read in the train. But incidentally Iâ€™m not so much impressed as I expected by it. Vivid, but rather wordy so far.
