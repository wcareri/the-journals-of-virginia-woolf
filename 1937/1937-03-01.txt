### Monday 1 March

I wish I could write out my sensations at this moment. They are so peculiar & so unpleasant. Partly Tâ ime of Lâ ife? I wonder. A physical feeling as if I were drumming slightly in the veins: very cold: impotent: & terrified. As if I were exposed on a high ledge in full light. Very lonely. L. out to lunch. Nessa has Quentin & dont want me. Very useless. No atmosphere round me. No words. Very apprehensive. As if something cold & horribleâ€”a roar of laughter at my expense were about to happen. And I am powerless to ward it off: I have no protection. And this anxiety & nothingness surround me with a vacuum. It affects the thighs chiefly. And I want to burst into tears, but have nothing to cry for. Then a great restlessness seizes me. I think I could walk it offâ€”walk & walk till I am asleep. But I begin to dislike that sudden drugged sleep. And I cannot unfurl my mind & apply it calmly & unconsciously to a book. And my own little scraps look dried up & derelict. And I know that I must go on doing this dance on hot bricks till I die. This is a little superficial I admit. For I can burrow under & look at myself displayed in this ridiculous way & feel complete submarine calm: a kind of calm moreover which is strong enoâ€™ to lift the entire load: I can get that at moments; but the exposed moments are terrifying. I looked at my eyes in the glass once & saw them positively terrified. Its the 15th March approachâ ing I supposeâ€”the dazzle of that head lamp on my poor little rabbits body wh. keeps it dazed in the middle of the road. (I like that phrase. That gives me confidence.)
