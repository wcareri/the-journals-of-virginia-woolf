### Tuesday 19 October

It came over me suddenly last night, as I was reading The Shooting Party,â€”the story that Iâ€™m to send to America, H.B., that I saw the form of a new novel. Its to be first the statement of the theme: then the restatement: & so on: repeating the same story: singling out this & then that: until the central idea is stated.

This might also lend itself to my book of criticism. But how I dont now, being very jaded in the brain, try to discover.

What happened was this: when I finished the S.P. I thought, now that the woman has called a taxi; I will go on to meet, say, Christabel, at T. Square who tells the story again: or I will expatiate upon my own idea in telling the story; or I will find some other person at the S.P. whose life I will tell: but all the scenes must be controlled, & radiate to a centre. I think this is a possible idea; & wd. admit of doing it in short bursts: cd. be a concentrated small book: cd. contain many varieties of mood. And possibly criticism. I must keep the idea at the back of my mind for a year or two, while I do Roger &c.

This struck me just as the Spenders came to dinner. I was depressed. Why do I resent Stephen now that Julianâ€™s dead?â€”the incredible words? Just before they came I found the lines in Lowell: Biglow papers: Its hard to see the young go fust, all brimming full of gifts & graces â€¦ whose coming steps thereâ€™s some that wont, no, not lifelong leave off ~~expecting~~ awaiting, (something like that). Then Stephen comes in: not Julian. Last time they dined, it was to meet Julian. Well, one must not think of this. Julian wd. have said, â€œBut my dearâ€”once he said sweetheartâ€”(I suspect his word for his loves) its clear that youâ€™ve got to go on & comfort Nessa.â€ Thats what he wd say at this moment. Oh Lord!

Well: I will go to Maples about chaircovers; to Highgate to see Rogerâ€™s house; & dream today, because I must unscrew my head & somehow freshen up if I am to write, to live, to go through the next lap with zest, not like old sea weed. Stephen talked mostly about a new magazine: another; to run 6 numbers; L. to write politics in each: as the unifyer. & the H.P. to publish. But he wont; & the H.P. wonâ€™t. So it fizzled out. Then there was a good deal of politics: Inez a precise, horse headed woman, at last emerged. Talked of her Spanish book. Still an Oxford student. They had been seeing Ottoline. Not much gossip. A fog.
