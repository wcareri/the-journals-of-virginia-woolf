### Tuesday 22 June

Isnt it shameful to write here first thing, not to tackle Congreve? But my brain after talking to Miss Sarton, to Murray, to Ann gave out after dinner, so that I cdnâ€™t read Love for Love. And I wonâ€™t do 3 Gs. till Mondayâ€”till Iâ€™ve had a quiet breather. Then the Prof. Chapter: then the final â€¦

So now to draw the blood off that brain to another partâ€”according to H. Nicolsonâ€™s prescription, which is the right one. I wd. like to write a dream story about the top of a mountain. Now why? About lying in the snow; about rings of colour; silence â€¦ & the solitude. I cant though. But shant I, one of these days, indulge myself in some short releases into that world? Short now for ever. No more long grinds: only sudden intensities. If I cd. think out another adventure. Oddly enough I see it now ahead of meâ€”in Charing X road yesterdayâ€”as to do with books: some new combination. Brighton? A round room on the pierâ€”& people shopping, missing each otherâ€”a story Angelica told in the summer. But how does this make up with criticism? Iâ€™m trying to get the 4 dimensions of the mind .. life in connection with emotions from literatureâ€”A days walkâ€”a mindâ€™s adventure: something like that. And its useless to repeat my old experiments: they must be new to be experiments.

Ann is a great sea monster. Her hair is bound with a fillet bought at Woolworth. She is sunburnt, sea kissed. What I mean is sheâ€™s like the figure head of the Aurora Jane. She & Richard (engaged?) ask us to supper on Monday. This pleases us, who are now teased & tried by invitations of every sort. The young are pretty ruthless though. Fierce & egotistical, also very sensitive. Ann said she shd. have taken a First: owing to politics took a third. I gave her 5gs. but she didnâ€™t think it cost me muchâ€”certainly hadnâ€™t read The Years.

Sarton had: disappointed; but a â€˜greater bookâ€™ than Waves. Waves her cup oâ€™ tea. Her cup oâ€™ rose waterâ€”that is, sheâ€™s fine drawn, wd. be poetic, more gushing though in letter than in speech. She has a shrewd American vein: she ran a theatre for 3 years in N. York; but it failed so she took to poetry, & the Zoo: that is lives, for the summer, in Julian Huxleyâ€™s lodging at Whipsnade, writing a novel for Kot, & we had to promise to dine there. Ann Watkins is now hot on the scent of magazine articles, & wants another talk. But here my gorge rises. No I will not write for the larger paying magazines: in fact, couldnâ€™t. In this way I put 3 Guineas daily into practice. For hereâ€™s Rosemary Beresford coming, & I shall tactfully cross-examine her about Eng. Lit. at Cambridge. Ann thinks Pernel far too conservative. Miss Cristal wants a chapel. Miss C. wont let them have gramophones. But theyâ€™re allowed out at night. Weâ€™re a poor college, she said casually, therefore cant join clubs. But I doubt if she sees the force of my arguments. She is absorbed in politicsâ€”communismâ€”& Richard. According to her the scheme is to accept L. Pâ . policy, of gradual revision: Eduâ cation, wages; socialism; but to be ready to enforce it by force. Force may produce win what cant be won except by force. She instanced the Fr. Revn. I denied it. Its the glory of death in battle, not in childbirth that appeals to them; the spectacular; the limelight. But I shall investigate further on Monday.
