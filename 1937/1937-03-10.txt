### Wednesday 10 March

The fatal day is approachingâ€”in fact I think if I can slip out after tea & buy a paper I may have the experience tomorrowâ€”when my little reputation lies like an old cigarette end. But Iâ€™m too jaded with 3 Gs. to care to find even the right metaphor. In my perhaps cowardly wish to store have next week as an empty compartment, Iâ€™ve crammed this too full: had Christabel yesterday, must have Nan Hudson today: & to my dismay L. suddenly wants to have Mrs R. & Elaine tomorrow: & the Bagenals are dining. On Friday we get offâ€”the doomed discarded ridiculed novelist. What care I? I begin to whistle, but Iâ€™m too jaded.
