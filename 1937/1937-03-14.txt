I am in such a twitter owing to 2 columns in the Observer praising The Years that I cant, as I foretold, go on with 3 Guineas. Why I even sat back just now & thought with pleasure of people reading that review. And when I think of the agony I went through in this room, just over a year agoâ€¦. when it dawned on me that the whole of 3 years work was a complete failure: & then when I think of the mornings here when I used to stumble out & cut up those proofs & write 3 lines, & then go back & lie on my bedâ€”the worst summer in my life, but at the same time the most illuminatingâ€”its no wonder my hand trembles. What most pleases me thoâ€™, is the obvious chance now since de Selincourt sees it, that my intention in The Years may be not so entirely muted & obscured as I feared. The TLS spoke as if it were merely the death song of the middle classes: a series of exquisite impressions; but he sees that it is a creative, a constructive book. Not that Iâ€™ve yet altogether read him: but he has pounced on some of the key sentences. And this means that it will be debated; & this means that 3 Gs. will strike very sharp & clear on a hot iron: so that my immensely careful planning wonâ€™t be baulked by time of life &c. as I had made certain. Making certain however was an enormous discovery for me, though. If thereâ€™s one triumph I applaudâ€”excuse this flamboyant languageâ€”it is the afternoon when Desmond came, & Nan Hudson was there: & I almost cracked with the wish to talk to him about The Yrs & Nan sat on, like some tepid bread poultice; & I summoned my forces, & got her to talk to me about her own life & Ethel (that was a chink) instead of letting the agonising hour go to ruin.

Now at any rate money is assured: L. shall have his new car; we will be floated again; & my last lapâ€”if Iâ€™ve only 10 years of life moreâ€”should be fruitful. Workâ€”work. But at the moment, the relief is so great, not I think an ignoble fame-gratified reliefâ€”that I feel myself rocking up & down, like a bush a huge fowl sat on. Still I must remember that Iâ€™m bound to get a good many shrewd knocks. And much of The Years is very feebleâ€”for example the scene in the college still makes me blush.

Dinner at Charleston last night. Julian grown a manâ€”I mean vigorous, controlled, as I guess embittered, something to me tragic in the sadness now, his mouth & face much tenser; as if he had been thinking in solitude. Nessa said he hasnâ€™t altogether given up his idea of Spain: all depends on getting a job here. I felt him changed: taut, tense, on the defensive: yet affectionate: but no longer spontaneous. He comes to tea today. And L. was irritated by the intense â€œself centrednessâ€ of my family: Nessa only cares for her children: Julian canâ€™t even let her know his decision, so inconsiderate; all â€œon the makeâ€. This is partly due to his family complex; but thereâ€™s some truth in it.

And now I can put my philosophy of the free soul into operation. Thats what Iâ€™m thinkingâ€”neednâ€™t go to the writers auction on 20th. All the falsities can drop off.
