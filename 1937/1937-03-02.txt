### Tuesday 2 March

Iâ€™m going to be beaten, Iâ€™m going to be laughed at, Iâ€™m going to be held up to scorn & ridiculeâ€”I found myself saying those words just now. Yet Iâ€™ve been absorbed all the morning in the Unâ iversitâ y part of 3 Gs. And the absorption is genuine; & my great defence against the cold madness that overcame me last night. Why did it suddenly point itself like a rain cloud & discharge all its cold water? Because I was switched off doing Pictures in the morning; & then at the play, I suddenly thought the Book Society has not even recommended The Years. Thats true; but the B.S. is not an infallible guide. Anyhow these days of waiting must be a dull cold torture. I shall be happy enoâ€™ this time next month Iâ€™ve no doubt. Meanwhile, suffer me now & again to write out my horror, the sudden cold madness, here. It is partly T. of L. I think still. And it wont be anything like so bad in action as in prospect. The worst will be that the book will be treated with tepid politeness, as an effusive diluted tired book. All my other books have stirred up strife; this one will sink slowly & heavily. But when thats said, need I fear more? I may get praise from some peopleâ€”indeed I think there must be some â€˜seriousnessâ€™ in it. And I can feel a little proud that I have faced the music; that we have sold 5,000 before publication; that we shall get some money; that Iâ€™m doing my share, & not merely subsiding into terrified silence. Also my own psychology interests me. I intend to keep full notes of my ups & downs, for my private information. And thus objectified, the pain & shame become at once much less. And I have proved to my own conviction that I can write with fury, with rapture, with absorption still. Now the BBC want a story.
