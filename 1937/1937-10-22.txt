### Friday 22 October

I am basking my brains. No I didnt go to Paris. This is a note to make. Waking at 3 I decided I would spend the week end at Paris. Got so far as looking up trains, consulting Nessa about hotel. Then L. said he wd. rather not. Then I was overcome with happiness. Then we walked round the square love makingâ€”after 25 years cant bear to be separate. Then I walked round the Lake in Regents Park. Then â€¦ you see it is an enormous pleasure, being wanted: a wife. And our marriage so complete.

To return to facts (thoâ€™ this â€˜fictionâ€™ is radiant still under my skin): walked to see Rogerâ€™s Highgate birthplace: suddenly L. developed the idea of making the young Brainies take the Press as a Cooperative company (John; Isherwood; Auden; Stephen). All are bubbling with discontent & ideas. All want a focus; a manager: a mouthpiece: a common voice. Wd. like L. to manage it. Couldnt we sell, & creep out? Thats the ideaâ€”& yet keep the soul, translated into this on the whole appropriate body? Anyhow, John was heard in the Press: consulted; interested; fights shy of money; Â£6,000: will lunch with I. & discuss. And now telephones he will come on Monday. So that fats a frizzling. Off now, not to Paris, but to the Grocer with the Cupid, so to MH, Q. & the L.P. meeting: a fair exchange for Paris, where, too, I shd. have met & mixed with Nick, Barbara, Saxon, & the Easdales. Nick, the lout with a veneer of 2nd hand Bloomsbury, came to tea, & considerably exacerbated me. He is having lectures on ways of improving his intercourse with Judith. Duncan gave me a green brooch. A fine day.
