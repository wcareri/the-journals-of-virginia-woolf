### Tuesday 30 November

Yes, its actually the last day of November; & theyve passed like a streak of hounds after a fox because Iâ€™ve been re-writing 3 Guineas with such intentness, indeed absorption, that several times 5 minutes past one has shown on the clock & I still at it. So Iâ€™ve never even looked at this stout volume. I have left out Cambridge: Peter & Prudence; the shiny busts; the bitter cold silent city; the chatter at Annâ€™s; Newmarket; Oh & people innumerable. Or so I think, for I have not time to re-read. A great strain; but how merciful a compulsion, so that I need not go into the sensation I have on drinking tea at 8 with Nessa. No, no, I will not describe that: dont I dread it? But I make myself all the same stay on when sheâ€™s alone. Innumerable people: the Hutchinsons, Katie Lewis, Adrian, Cecil Duckworth, Geraldâ€™s relics still littering the drawing room. Some extravagances: Oxford Walpole bought off Hopkins at the Book Show: Vita there, signing, dabbing her lips red, with Gwen in attendance; my profound distaste for Haroldâ€™s Dufferin, its falseness; equal exacerbation from Wyndham Lewis & Nevinsonâ€™s autobiographies; strong effect of mean minds; & buying with some recklessness, fur boots, leather waistcoat, underclothes; for money once more brims the pot. I could make Â£100 by choosing books for the Pelicans, with Morgan & Hugh & Aldous, but have refused, by way of a snub to Lane 200 for shifting, sans apology, from Leonard to me. And Iâ€™m paid by Cosmopolitan, 120 by Hâ .B.: another 120: then 25: which adds up to 465. Â£465 for a handful of old sketches. This a little shames me in comparison with Nessaâ€™s sales: but then I reflect, I put my life blood into writing, & she had children.

At Duncanâ€™s show, we met the Bugger boys, Joe, Morgan, William; & savoured the usual queer scent. Joe the slave of The Listener. And what will the slaves say when 3 Gs. comes out? in March I suppose. Then the Webbs ask us to lunch to meet the Shaws. We fight shy; & are now asked to Liphook. A very foggy November: a trail of brown every day, keeping us at home of an evening. And one of these foggy evenings, Ethel Smyth came, & then Madame de Polignac, like a perfectly stuffed cold fowl (K. Lewis, with her white hands, plump, with emeralds, had that look too). Another evening Lady Simon came, commends my secret & nefarious projects: not to get anyone else into trouble. &c. And so the month has run through my fingers, with a walk or two: many letters & some divine quiet evenings. L. in his stall, I in mine, reading Chateaubriand now, bought in 6 fine vols for one guinea at Cambridge: also much random trash as usual, & many lives & some blue books for my little harlequin book; but no poetry I observeâ€”no Shakespeare, because by instinct I suppose, & here must change by force to white paper, I want prose to quiet my brain. Or am I lazy? Now the sacred hour comes, luncheon: a wet damp day; & I must alas lavish my after tea time upon Eth Bowen, for all that I like her, a source of regret.
