### Thursday 25 March

Yes, 2 days lying down, & cant write today. But a divine holiday. No reviews. Listener not done it. And sales great. A rush before Easter: 280 sold yesterday. Nessa to tea. But I will not write: am only waiting for my signature to dry. B. Richmond asked one for Ormond St. hospital. Boat Race at 11.30. Then we go tomorrow. No letters about Years, save one from Ly Simon. Kot, Hayward, Margery Fry all in favour of Years. No one else has yet read, or spoken. And its very fine, clear & cold. The Dss of Bedford lost.
