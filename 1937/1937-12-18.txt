### Saturday 18 December

Oh this cursed year 1937â€”it will never let us out of its claws. Now its L.â€™s kidneys: Rau says he may have a chill, or it may be something wrong with the kidneys; possibly the prostate glandâ€”that perennial horror. Its more likely, he says, to be a chill; but cant tell for a fortnight. So we go away with that hanging over usâ€”And once more my only refuge is work. So I wont expatiate. The great cat is playing with us once more.

How much do I mind death? I wondered last night, when I did not go to Helenâ€™s painters party, & concluded that there is a sense in which the end could be accepted calmly. Thats odd, considering that few people are more immensely interested by life: & happy. Its Julianâ€™s death that makes one sceptical of life I suppose. Not that I ever think of him as dead: which is queer. Rather as if he were jerked abruptly out of sight, without rhyme or reason: so violent & absurd that one cant fit his death into any scheme. But here we are, on a fine cold day, going to mate Sally at Ickenham: a saner proceeding than to analyse here. In fact Iâ€™m still spinning over 3 Gs. Finished the 2nd today for typing.

Helenâ€™s party, Mabel said, viewing it from the pantry where she washed up till 2.30 am, was crowded noisy drunk. Several young people fell down tipsy. The fumes of punch made her head ache. This is a jaundiced pantry view; but so would mine have been I daresay had I gone. And Iâ€™ve promised to guarantee Â£25 for 2 years. Why? Helenâ€™s rather exacerbating partisanship, when she dined with Joe here & was the old cantankerous Helen of Bernard St. made me ask this question.
