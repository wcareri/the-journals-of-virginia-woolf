That extraordinary scribble means, I suppose, the translator coming. Madame or Mlle Youniac(?) Not her name. And I had so much to write about Julian, who is half a sensitive suppressed intellectual, living with rather acute affections & perceptions in Rogerâ€™s shade. (I was devoted to him: but he wanted me to hate my public school. And I never got enough of the open air, till Joan took us to Failand. Even then I was afraid of lambs. And then I drank too much after bump suppers at Cambridge .. Oh Roger always had so many things on hand. One felt one didnt come up to his standard. Then there was Champco: & the Ott. I didnt develop that side of me till later. But I had a few days quite alone with himâ€”let me see (heâ€™s very precise) that was July 1934. We drove from Dieppe to Dijon. I had the impression that he was much happier. At Norwich one day the car punctured; & we didnt meet & so on, & I said to Eva, a few years ago heâ€™d have been raging & rampingâ€”now he was as calm as anything.) What I meant was, this the shady civilised side is only half of Julian: the other is the ordinary Colonial, which I like too; all this expert talk about cattle; & the coyotes, & how they ride. A good rider is a man who can jump into the saddle of an unbroken horse, & sit him while he breaks in two. How Julian did this, & cdnâ€™t catch onto the saddle & fell: & Eva wdnâ€™t let him mount; but he has a great affection for that horse. A boy of 16 is now in charge. The reason they wear high heeled boots is so that they dont catch in the stirrups. Only through wearing those boots was he now here. All the beef is sold to the liners going to China. Beef is always good on shipâ€”not mutton. And he likes riding all day after his cattle; & thinks, at night, if he has rounded them up that he has done something. Doubts sometimes crop up I suspect; about his wife too. But one doesnt know how one makes these decisions. Roger always gave him very good advice, rather casually I gather. And he drank a bottle of claret, 2 glasses of vermouth, & got a little â€œlitâ€ as he would call it. And he wd. have stayed talking about Canada till one. I suppose the stimulus of society. So Iâ€™ve no time or room to describe the translator, save that she wore some nice gold leaves on her black dress; is a woman I suppose with a past; amorous; intellectual; lives half the year in Athens; is in with Jaloux &c, red lipped, strenuous; a working Fchwoman; friend of the Margeries; matter of fact; intellectual; we went through The Waves. What does â€œSee here he comes?â€ mean & so on.

And the Dr. says L. is quite normal! So all that might have been spared
