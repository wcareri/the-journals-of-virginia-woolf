Another curious idiosyncracy. Maynard thinks The Years my best book: thinks one scene, Eâ . & Crosby, beats Tchehovâ€™s Cherry Orchardâ€”& this opinion though from the centre, from a very fine mind, doesnâ€™t flutter me as much as Muirâ€™s blame; it sinks in slowly & deeply. Its not a vanity feeling; the other is: the other will die as soon as this weeks number of The Listener is passed. L. went to Tilton & had a long quiet cronies talk. Maynard not well; cramp in the muscle of the heart. His toes curl up. Lydia anxious. Queer, since he said at Xmas he had never been so well. Talk of what to do for Julian, who strikes everyone as depressed. Oh & no papers this morningâ€”what a curious spite against me, to keep me mildly frizzling all day. But after all, if Desmond does me he will only be mildly avuncular & depressing. Most likely he wont do me. Oh to be quit of reviews! Reading Balzac with great pleasure. Novel reading power is coming back.

Maynard said that he thought The Years very movingâ ; more tender than any of my books; did not puzzle him like The Waves; symbolism not a worry; very beautiful; & no more said than was needed, hadnt yet finished it. But how compose the 2 opinions; its my most human book: & most inhuman? Oh to forget all this & writeâ€”as I must tomorrow.
