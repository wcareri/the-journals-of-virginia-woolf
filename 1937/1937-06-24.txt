A letter from Ott. praising my NS. Gibbon article, Now I have observed that any of my friends who disliked The Years always praise my articles, by way of urging me to give up fiction, & I suppose to make amends to me for not liking The Years. She has been very ill; almost thought she wd have â€œwaved us adieuâ€ but is recovering at Tunbridge Wells. Pipsy reads Emma to her, & she reads H James to herself.

Last night was a hard & fruitless grind: that is, I cant see why Saxon shd have dropped Rosemary into our mill; nor was there much point in bringing the Finnâ€”a flaxen honest girl, who spoke very little English, & couldnâ€™t understand a third of what we said. Saxon himself maintained almost complete silenceâ€”benevolent, but self indulgent; lazy. Why? I asked again & again, and should have had even harder work if Ann & Richard Ll. D. hadnâ€™t come in; Karin & Adrian on top, rather unharmoniously. So we tumbled & tossed. Poor little RB, going to teach Eng. Lit. to children in the provinces. So I lashed out at teaching Eng Lit. Ann very spontaneous, ardent & rough, at the same time sensitiveâ€”a very attractive combination, with the beauty of a ships figure headâ€”a little blown back & battered. Richard I suppose selfish, but amiable enough. Rebecca West asked us to dine that night. Wellâ€”I dont know if that wd have done better. Odd that Saxon was so insistent for so little reason.
