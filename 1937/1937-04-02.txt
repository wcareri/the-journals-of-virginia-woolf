### Friday 2 April

How I interest myself! Quite set up & perky today with a mind brimming, because I was so damnably depressed & smacked on the cheek by Edwin Muir in The Listener & by Scott James in the Life & Letters on Friday. They both gave me a smart snubbing: EM says The Years is dead & disappointingâ€”so in effect did S. James. All the lights sank; my reed bent to the ground. Dead & disappointingâ€”so Iâ€™m found out & that odious rice pudding of a book is what I thought itâ€”a dank failure. No life in it. Much inferior to the bitter truth & intense originality of Miss Compton Burnett. Now this pain woke me at 4 am. & I suffered acutely. All day driving to Janet & back I was under the cloud. But about 7 it lifted. There was a good review, of 4 lines, in The Empire review. The best of my books: did that help? I dont think very much. But the delight of being exploded is quite real. One feels braced for some reason; amused; roused; combative; more than by praise. Of course I was pleased when L. said none of our friends read The Listener. Anyhow, my spirits rose, calm & steady; & I feel once more immune, set on my own feet, a fighter.

No one has written to me. So I feel that buffeting is over, & I can make a fresh start. Still only Desmond to comeâ€”if he is to come: & then perfect freedom.

A very interesting visit to Janet. Both of them as spry & gay & even charming to look at as possible. Janet rounded & mellowed, with the beautifulâ€”â€”telephone: Keynesâ€™s: Maynard is reading The Years. & is enthusiastic. Well that does please me, all the sameâ€”For one thing it gives more ply to 3 Guineas. Now Iâ€™m making up my Broadcast: whose date weâ€™ve tried to change: but to continue with J. & E. A little thatched sunny house, full of nice furniture. Emphie with those lustrous eyes, as if she had always lived her life. She is completely at her ease; voluble; human, spontaneous. Flitting as usual from room to room interrupting, but as naturally as a bird, one eye spilling tears; but no gloom aboutâ€”a natural gaiety & fun. Its true Janet is apparently dying; but they dont know how long sheâ€™ll be at it. Such a bore, she said, to have got this ulcer just as weâ€™d planned to have a nice old age together. So many things we wanted to do. They had meant to go to Holland & look at birds. Nor was this a pose; no stiffness about it, quite natural. So we had a sip of talk with Janetâ€”then with E.: E. says she canâ€™t believe in death ending thingsâ€”whats 70 years? So shortâ€”so shortâ€”Whats it all for I ask if it ends now? Oh no we go onâ€”Iâ€™m convinced of that. It cdnâ€™t be possible otherwiseâ€”so senselessâ€”all the time balancing one elbow in a grey jumper on the edge of the table; a tear running. Now Janet dont believe thisâ€”she dont go to Church. I do. Iâ€™ll just see if sheâ€™s ready for you. Yes, weâ€™ve always been poor. But then we made up our mindsâ€”we wdnt go to Theatres, we wdnt have clothes. Weâ€™d have good foodâ€”my mother always said that was so important for the youngâ€”& then we had to earn our livings. That was so interestingâ€”made you know interesting people. Very few girls in our time had to work.

With Janet gossip, rather straitened, owing to time, about the past; the present; her belief, owing to Heardâ€™s book, in some sort of life in common, not as individuals. Some mystic survival. The young wanting it. No religion. Katherine Asquith offering to come: but I doubt if she wants visits. Quite happy, some discomfort, cant sit or walk.

What is so odd is the switch over from thinking oneself a bad writer (after Muir) to thinking oneself a great writer (after Myanard). On the whole, being a bad writer gives one a greater feeling of freedom: but not the same glory. Difference between oneâ€™s back to the wall & soaring with pinions through the dominions ..â€”soaring with supreme dominionâ€”how does it go?â€”the most liquid line in poetry.
