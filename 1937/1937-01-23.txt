A dripping foggy day: Miss Westâ€™s funeral at Golders Green. The same table, the same flowers: a little purple coffin: a large eagle like parson: & a scatter of brown, dowdy, very old & feeble spinsters: Miss Howlett chief mourner. Miss Howlett with knotted hands: an old pink face; blue steady aged eyes. Nothing dingier & less forcible cd. be imagined. And we were forced to wail through hymn 478 or some such number; about saints receiving their due; alleluia. Only the hired man from the undertaker, or one of the crematorium servants sang: once a woman piped up: but gave out. L. & I sat grimly. The attendant then touched a spring, & the little coffin slid through; after which we gathered in the cloister & inspected the wreaths. Miss Howlett then was led forward, & formally shook hands, & thanked us for our letters. As for Miss West, had she been a kitten or a puppy I think one wd. have felt as much. And yet there was something alive, humorous, kindly, & even merry in the basement room where she sat surrounded with neat papers; a spotted horse; a carved wooden flower, & a piece of green linoleum. Miss L. came up and said she was left executor of what little money belonged to Margaret. One of the wreaths was what L. called a best sellerâ€™s wreath. Miss Delafield was there. But I think on the whole Miss W. enjoyed the H.P. She liked literary parties, & had an unselfish, quite disinterested temper. But its the serviceâ€”the unreality.
