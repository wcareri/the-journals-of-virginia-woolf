### Wednesday 14 April

I must make myself correct Gibbon & send today. But after those months of correction, correction almost makes me cry out in agony. So to ease myself Iâ€™m taking 10 minutes rapid writing. Iâ€™ve done, that is scribbled down, my BBC essayâ€”with some exhilaration. Old Ethel came to tea, & left her thorns in my flesh. Said I was the strongest of women, by way of hinting that L. & I had kept her away at Rodmell on a pretext. But I did not write & tell her so; No: Iâ€™m sunk in privacy in quiet. How strange! It would be flat, if I were not active in the head. Not a letter this morning: only 10 or 11 perhaps about The Years since it came out. Nobody talks to me about it, nobody now writes about it. It seems to have sailed out of sight. And I have some foolish shrinking from meeting anyone who would talk, or not talk of it. Yet it sellsâ€”best of all my novels. Hâ arcourt Bâ race in America have sold 12,000 before publicationâ€”easily my record. Honestly I do not know what to think of this book: is it good or bad? Honestly I am flooredâ€”& so will not think, but cut back as quick as I can to 3 Guineas. Fresh as June dawn in my head again. Another run ahead of me.

And tonight Kingsley Martin, Stephen Spender & Julian dine. K.M. in an agitated voice on the phone asks L. why I wont write for NS. is it money? They propose to increase my fee & also offer more space. So what am I to say then? The truth?
