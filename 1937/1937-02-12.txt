Why should I write here? Only that I am devilishly anxious. L. is going to a Harley St specialist at 4 today to get a report: whether the sugar means diabetes or prostate gland or nothing serious. And I must face facts: how to keep cool, how to control myself, if it is a bad report. Work is my only help. That is the conclusion I came to last night. Probably it is only a question of treatment. Anyhow we shall soon know, unless he keeps us hanging about.

It is a very fine cold day & we are going straight on down to Rodmell where there is a L. party meeting & Q. to dinner. I have been writing hard since Jan 28th at 3 Guineas, & must simply keep at it. Even if I dont manage to finish it,â€”& I expect I shallâ€”it is the one support. I have got it into trimâ€”that is I can I think pour all I want to rather roughly & quickly into this form. Various people skim in and out: but that becomes very dim. We had too the anxiety about Julianâ€”he tells C. Mauron that he means to enlist for Spain. Cornfordâ€™s son was killed there last week. But I cant feel that now anything like so much as I did before this happened. Nessa was in one of her entirely submerged moods on Monday when we went in. Always that extraordinary depth of despair. But I must fight, thats my instinct. And happily these statements may be extreme; but we are faced with a horrid afternoon; & cant ignore it. Odd tho how any kind of actionâ€”that we have to get ready & goâ€”makes thinking impossible. I feel like the man who had to keep dancing on hot bricks. Cant let myself stop. Hence I suppose I write here; wh. explains why Tolstoy & his wife kept diaries.
