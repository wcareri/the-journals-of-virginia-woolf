### Tuesday 14 February

So far had I written that Monday when Fergusson came in & pronounced that my eccentric pulse had passed the limits of reason & was in fact insane. So I was laid in bed again, & set up my state in the drawing room, where I now write sitting up in bed, alongside the fire, with a temperature a shade below normal, & a heart become naturally abnormal, so that perhaps I shall be up & creeping this time next week. I am reading Moby Dick: Princesse de Cleves; Lord Salisbury: Old Mortality; Small Talk at Wreyland; with an occasional bite at the Life of Lord Tennyson, of Johnson; & anything else I find handy. But this is all dissipated & invalidish. I can only hope that like dead leaves they may fertilise my brain. Otherwise, what a 12 months it has been for writing!â€”& I at the prime of life, with little creatures in my head which wonâ€™t exist if I dont let them out. K.M. bursts upon the world in glory next week; I have to hold over Jacobâ€™s Room till October; & I somehow fear that by that time it will appear to me sterile acrobatics. Nevertheless, such is life, that I am very tolerably amused; see a good many people, Elena, Kot, Adrian, Lytton today; & drowse off comfortably. It is illness at its best. We dine over the fire. L. has his tray on a little stool. We are as comfortable as cottagers (looked at through the window) & this morning dropped from the blue (yes it is blue, & frost on the roofs, & Ralph skating at Tidmarsh; & Mrs Sanders not sent her proofs) Â£114.18., unexpected payment by Mitchells, in whom I lost, so I thought, Â£600. This is mercy indeed; for we were very low at the bank, having bought type; & would have had to sell out, for our travels & printers bills. God after all does exist; for always some wind brings down an apple at the critical moment.

Elena has grown solid, like a tree trunk. She keeps her mystery. A performing sealâ€”one doesnâ€™t know what is instinct, what intellect. I find her sympatheticâ€”so maternal, quiet, kindly; & liking literature as a lady does; & saying such unexpected things about it, as a lady does. She doesnâ€™t like representation in fiction; canâ€™t stand Wells & Bennett; attempts Dorothy Richardson; is puzzled; reverts to Scott; hasnâ€™t heard of Joyce; comfortably waves aside indecency; I should guess that she represents the top layer of the Mudie general public very accurately. She is modest, even reserved, about her own doings, which gives her charm. Would have like a country lifeâ€”dogs, garden, village charities, county committees, Gunby & Stephen Massingberd I suppose, best of all; & hates London, where she has had however her great successes. Like my father, I am attracted by the simple & affectionate & womanly. Not that she now dresses with beauty or has much to boast. She is a handsome du Maurier matron, with a double chin, settled complexion; & she dresses in a pepper & salt tailor made, wears spats, & has something of the American bust. I like chattering to her about literature. On Saturday when she comes again, I shall try to discuss the Lushingtons.

And Adrian is so happy & genial that I am really pleased. I donâ€™t want to make him out a failure even. An unambitious man, with good brains, money, wife & children is, I daresay, the most fortunate of us all. He need not protect himself by any illusions. He sees things as they are. He is humorous, contented; free to enjoy without envy or uneasiness. â€œOh wellâ€, he said talking of his medical career, â€œitâ€™s something to do.â€ â€œIts easier now to go on than to stopâ€ he said. He has his ya(t)cht, & as the years pass, he will ripen into a delightful father. Moreover, like the whole family, he has this distinguished, cool, point of view, which always makes him good company, & admits him to any societyâ€”if he wished for any society, which needless to say, he doesnâ€™t.

Saxonâ€™s father is dead; & Saxon controls two houses of lunatics, some with broken legs, others with the influenza; which will make a man of him, so all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds.

I did not enjoy Molly's visit. She is so deaf; so wandering; grown as plump as a ptarmigan; inconclusive more than ever; given to sudden vacant pauses, with her head dropped down; yet very affectionate in her flittermouse way; with that charming irresponsible heartlessness, which always amuses me. She wakes from a pause & raps out something quite to the point & even prosaic. She told me how she had loved the Governor of Madras, & refused Desmond for him, & was very glad now she had married Desmond, who suits her exactly she said. Why did I not enjoy Mollyâ€™s visit then? Well, she never concentrates upon me, I suppose.

I meant to make some notes of my reading (which should include Peacock by the way) but Lottieâ€™s interminable gossip with the old witch wood woman frets me. Talkâ€”talkâ€”talkâ€”wonder expressedâ€”loud laughterâ€”agreementâ€”wood womanâ€™s voice claps more & more emphaticâ€”Nelly there tooâ€”Talk with them a kind of muscular activity I think, for they never say much: repeat one thing over & over.

Goodbye goodbyeâ€”donâ€™t forget.

Ah! at last! And now Lottie must compare notes with Nelly downstairs.
