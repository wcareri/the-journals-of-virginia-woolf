### Friday 28 July

The affairs of the Pâ artridges. have engrossed us for 2 hours again; & a postscript had to be added to Lytton on the telephone. Iâ€™m afraid its a sordid business, as C. said. Nor do I like to see women unhappy. P.â€™s conduct is that of the village Don Juan. Again, he behaves like a bull in a garden. And with it he is malicious. He is a male bully, as L. says. I am reminded of the tantrums of Adrian & Clive. There is something maniacal in masculine vanity.
