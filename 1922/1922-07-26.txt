Just in from tea with the Mirrlees; who are vulgar, L. says: & I think I agree. They have vulgar friends. â€œPockyâ€â€”the girls name was, to whom Hope & I talked. She & the second housemaid had been carrying a salmon about London. She told us the story of her cornelians. Her mother now keeps her jewels, because she canâ€™t be trusted. Her mother calls her â€˜little girlâ€™; & her nostrils opened too wide, & she was self-possessed, & crude & cut a dash, & had no mind, & had the shingles in her hair, & would sit on gossiping with Hope, who seemed to like it all better than I thought right. Rub off the top varnishâ€”life, youth, colour, wealth (which we grant Pocky) & what remains? A dull old woman.

On Sunday L. read through Jacobâ€™s Room. He thinks it my best work. But his first remark was that it was amazingly well written. We argued about it. He calls it a work of genius; he thinks it unlike any other novel; he says that the people are ghosts; he says it is very strange: I have no philosophy of life he says; my people are puppets, moved hither & thither by fate. He doesnâ€™t agree that fate works in this way. Thinks I should use my â€˜methodâ€™, on one or two characters next time; & he found it very interesting, & beautiful, & without lapse (save perhaps the party) & quite intelligible. Pocky has so disturbed my mind that I cannot write this as formally as it deserves, for I was anxious & excited. But I am on the whole pleased. Neither of us knows what the public will think. Thereâ€™s no doubt in my mind that I have found out how to begin (at 40) to say something in my own voice; & that interests me so that I feel I can go ahead without praise.
