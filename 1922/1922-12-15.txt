### Friday 15 December

I forget what I was to say, & only write this now as I have 15 minutes before my solitary dinner, L. dining with Sangers, after a terrific Hogarth Press discussion ending in the final parting with Ralph. It was a question of the terms upon which the Tidmarsh Press (he was to run one in conjunction with us) was to have. He stood out for one third. Finally we agreed; but the discussion raised our backs, & soâ€”(Nell said that orange was badâ€”everything goes throughâ€”Lottieâ€™s conversation is running while I write). I am too muzzy headed to make out anything. This is partly the result of dining to meet the lovely gifted aristocratic Sackville West last night at Cliveâ€™s. Not much to my severer tasteâ€”florid, moustached, parakeet coloured, with all the supple ease of the aristocracy, but not the wit of the artist. She writes 15 pages a dayâ€”has finished another bookâ€”publishes with Heinemannsâ€”knows everyoneâ€”But could I ever know her? I am to dine there on Tuesday.

Waiting for L., I will continue. Half past ten just struck on one of these fine December nights, which come after sunny days, & I donâ€™t know why, keep sending through me such shocks from my childhood. Am I growing old & sentimental? I keep thinking of sounds I heard as a childâ€”at St Ives mostly.

The aristocratic manner is something like the actressesâ€”no false shyness or modesty: a bead dropped into her plate at dinnerâ€”given to Cliveâ€”asks for liqueurâ€”has her hand on all the ropesâ€”makes me feel virgin, shy, & schoolgirlish. Yet after dinner I rapped out opinions. She is a grenadier; hard; handsome, manly; inclined to double chin. Dear old Desmond moped like a tipsy owl in his corner, affectionate & glad to talk to me, I think. He said something about the French admiring Jacob, & wishing to translate it. I go on getting letters, & reap more praise than ever before. Sales sluggish though. Not yet 1000. But I donâ€™t mind.

As for Ralphâ€”that question certainly cant be settled before L. comes in. Why did he make me, & L., so furious by saying, in his sulky schoolboy voice, that if this crisis hadnâ€™t happened, he would have had a nice surprise to offer us at Easter?â€”something of Lyttonâ€™s presumably? I think the kernel of our discontent lies in that sentenceâ€”the bully, the swagger, the bribe offered us by Lytton, through this gawkish boor, & his simple rustic faith that writing by Lytton must solve all difficulties instead of which it complicates things.

So far as I can see, Ralphâ€™s disappearance would leave us more freedom, but give us more work. We should have to make further arrangements. But the basis would be sound, which is the great thing. If we keep Ralph, there will be constant disease. He hinted that he wished to be able to break. Again, the question of borrowing money from Lytton always recurs: & the obvious pressure they make to consolidate their position. This would be perfect if Ralph were not Ralph. I see him rigid & ossified in middle age; repeating more & more accurately his lesson learnt from Lytton. And though I would give a good deal to combine with Lytton in producing literature, there is little to be got from him save his own works. I mean, I think by our own merits now we attract all the young.
