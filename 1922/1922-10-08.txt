### Saturday 8 October

Back again, over the fire at Hogarth House, having read the first chapters of Bentley. Grizzel sits on L.â€™s knee. Boxallâ€”the kitten, called after Nelly to ingratiate her, is happily off mine; temporarily, or I could not write.

But the day has been spoilt for meâ€”so strangelyâ€”by Kitty Maxseâ€™s death; & now I think of her lying in her grave at Gunby, & Leo going home, & all the rest. I read it in the paper. I hadnâ€™t seen her since, I guess, 1908â€”save at old Daviesâ€™ funeral, & then I cut her, which now troubles meâ€”unreasonably I suppose. I could not have kept up with her; she never tried to see me. Yet yetâ€”these old friends dying without any notice on our part alwaysâ€”it begins to happen oftenâ€”saddens me: makes me feel guilty. I wish Iâ€™d met her in the street. My mind has gone back all day to her; in the queer way it does. First thinking out how she died, suddenly at 33 Cromwell Road; she was always afraid of operations. Then visualising herâ€”her white hairâ€”pink cheeksâ€”how she sat uprightâ€”her voiceâ€”with its characteristic tonesâ€”her green blue floorâ€”which she painted with her own hands: her earrings, her gaiety, yet melancholy; her smartness: her tears, which stayed on her cheek. Not that I ever felt at my ease with her. But she was very charmingâ€”very humorous. She got engaged at St Ives, & Thoby thought it was Paddy talking to his boy. They sat on the seat by the greenhouse in the Love Corner. However, I keep going over this very day in my mind.
