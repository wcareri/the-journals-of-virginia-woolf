### Tuesday 26 September

A great many things have happened, unrecorded. This has been the most sociable summer weâ€™ve ever had. Sometimes I feel as if, instead of sleeping through the months in a dark room, Iâ€™d been up in the light all night. Clive & Mary came; Mary in grey silk stockings; couldnâ€™t jump a ditch; was very affable; said she liked long walks; sat on the floor; praised Clive; & half invited me to Wittering. Morgan came on Friday; Tom on Saturday. My talk with Tom deserves writing down, but wonâ€™t get it for the light is fading; & one cannot write talk down either, as was agreed at Charleston the other day.

There was a good deal of talk about Ulysses. Tom said â€œHe is a purely literary writer. He is founded upon Walter Pater with a dash of Newman.â€ I said he was virileâ€”a he-goat; but didnâ€™t expect Tom to agree. Tom did thoâ€™; & said he left out many things that were important. The book would be a landmark, because it destroyed the whole of the 19th Century. It left Joyce himself with nothing to write another book on. It showed up the futility of all the English styles. He thought some of the writing beautiful. But there was no â€˜great conceptionâ€™: that was not Joyceâ€™s intention. He thought that Joyce did completely what he meant to do. But he did not think that he gave a new insight into human natureâ€”said nothing new like Tolstoi. Bloom told one nothing. Indeed, he said, this new method of giving the psychology proves to my mind that it doesnâ€™t work. It doesnâ€™t tell as much as some casual glance from outside often tells. I said I had found Pendennis more illuminating in this way. (The horses are now cropping near my window; the little owl calling; & so I write nonsense.)

So we got on to S. Sitwell who merely explores his sensibilityâ€”one of the deadly crimes as Tom thinks: to Dostoevskyâ€”the ruin of English literature, we agreed; Synge a fake: present state disastrous, because the form donâ€™t fit; to his mind not even promising well; he said that one must now be a very first rate poet to be a poet at all: when there were great poets, the little ones caught some of the glow, & were not worthless. Now thereâ€™s no great poet. When was the last? I asked; & he said none that interested him since the time of Johnson. Browning he said was lazy: they are all lazy he said. And Macaulay spoilt English prose. We agreed that people are now afraid of the English language. He said it came of being bookish, but not reading books enough. One should read all styles thoroughly. He thought D H Lawrence came off occasionally, especially in Aaronâ€™s Rod, the last book; had great moments; but was a most incompetent writer. He could cling tight to his conviction though. (Light now failsâ€”7.10. after a bad rainy day.)
