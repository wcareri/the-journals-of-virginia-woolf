### Friday 24 March

I write in order to drown the voice of the canary birdâ€”Leonardâ€™s typewriting I mean. I cannot read it down, but I can write it down. GravÃ© is imminent. I have nothing special to add as to my circumstances. Still invalided, I sit & receive visitors almost daily; & say nothing about them here. I am writing the first chapter of Reading with the usual fabulous zest. I have never enjoyed any writing more. How often have I said this? Does the pleasure last? I forgetâ€”I say I shall write the book in 6 months,â€”under the year, at any rate. For this reason, people are neglected, & accumulate, up & up & up: I cannot see them nowâ€”Nessa, Duncan, Toynbees, Bobo, Goldie, Mason, Roger, Clive, Clive, Clive, Ray. Clive is the most persistent; we talked from 4.30 to 10.15 the other day. It is clear that I am to rub up his wits; & in return I get my manners polished. I hear of supper parties; elicit facts about drink & talk & goings on. Viola Tree starts singing Mozart with a great hole in her stocking: Christabel â€œa little lump of passionâ€: Maryâ€”mum; Shearman confiding at 3 a.m. his distaste for life. Off we goâ€”C. & Iâ€”upon our relish for it. He enjoys everythingâ€”even the old hag in the doorway. There is no truth about life, he says, except what we feel. It is good if you enjoy it, & so forth. Obviously we reach no heights of reason. Nor do we become completely intimate. A little colour is added to taste. We have our embrace; our frill of sentiment. Impossible, as Nessa says, to talk without it. But I perceive, chiefly through his letters, that once a fortnight is the pitch of our relationship.

Nelly & Lottie have talked till the sky seems nothing but a dish cover echoing their changes of mind. They go home for the week end to settle the matter, & eat birthday cakes, & I guess that she wonâ€™t go to hospital after all. Refer back to some other scene of the kind if you wish to know how many hours have been wasted; how many reflections upon the lower classes formulated; & how often L. has approached me before I order dinner with a pained, solicitous appearance, begging me on no account to say this or that, strongly advising me at all costs to make something else plain.

Betty Potter loves me; is in despair; & I have to see her rehearse in order to keep her from suicide. How can anyone be such a fool as to believe in anyone?
