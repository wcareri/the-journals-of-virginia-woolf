### Sunday 3 September

Perhaps the greatest revolution in my life is the change of nibsâ€”no longer can I write legibly with my old blunt tree stumpâ€”people complainedâ€”But then the usual difficulties beginâ€”what is to take its place At the present moment Iâ€™m using Blackie against his nature, dipping him, that is to say. I should be reading the last immortal chapter of Ulysses: but Iâ€™m hot with Badmington in the orchard; L. is stamping the distemper down on my head, & we dine in 35 minutes & I must change, & the Sangers are coming in afterwards, Iâ€™m fretful with people. Every day will now be occupied till Tuesday week. So this is my last chance so far as diary goes, I daresay.

Walking in the church yard on Friday evening I made this remarkâ€”Its a very odd thing considering how impressive these country church-yards are, & how commonâ€¦. when we saw Dora Sanger being escorted towards us by a stout country woman. On introduction we discovered this to be Daphne, aged 16: a nice, sleek headed, brown eyed girl; in a macintosh. Now I had pictured her aged 6 or 10, still being given her bath by Charlie. We have met daily since; & as I say, they come round tonight, to sit up here & look at the view. Dora will look at the view Charlie prefers spiritual scenery. And we never really show signs of running out of talk. I have only to say, what was a Greek bedroom like in the age of Pericles, & Charlie puts it before one.

Charlie, I was saying, puts it before one. And Daphne is very well informed, & how adorable the young areâ€”like new brooms. I long to look over their shoulders, & see them sweeping clean. Indeed I much prefer them to the distinguished, wrapped soft in their reputations. She is at Bedales; goes to Newnham; then proposes to reform the world, by a moderate kind of revolution, so far as I understand herâ€”for we only stood a second talking under the shadow of the tree outside the Rest, last night. She will write pamphlets, as a beginning. And the truth is that the world is reformed by Daphne Sangerâ€™s pamphletsâ€”no doubt about it. At her age I was for knowing all that was to be known, & for writing a bookâ€”a bookâ€”But what book? That vision came to me more clearly at Manorbier aged 21, walking the down on the edge of the sea. Never have I contrived so to wedge myself into my work as this summerâ€”I cant endure interruptions. Maynard has asked us to Oare, where he keeps house with Lydia, & I should like to go, but we shanâ€™t. The new plan of rotating my crops is working well so far: I am always in a fizz & a stew, either to get my views on Chaucer clear, or on the Odyssey, or to sketch my next chapter. A polite letter from Harcourt Brace informs me that my MS has not arrivedâ€”& they take great interest in my work. This comes of not registering the parcelâ€”L.â€™s fault, Iâ€™m glad to say. I am galloping on, astride a J pen now, not very compactly; but the whole day has been dissipated, & now I must tidy the room.

Yes, on looking at the pages, I think the balance is all in favour of a steel nib. Blackie too smooth; the old blunderbuses too elephantine. Look how neat this is.
