to continueâ€”Certainly the later chapters are bare & grey: ground out too palpably: authorities, I daresay, interfering with the original flow. And Morton is a prig; & Edith a stick; & Evandale a brick; & the preachers dulness I could take for granted. Stillâ€”stillâ€”I want to know what the next chapter brings, & these gallant old fellows can be excused practically anything. How far can our historical portrait painters be trusted, seeing the difficulty I have in putting down the face of Violet Dickinson, whom I saw, for 2 hours yesterday afternoon? One hears her talking in a swinging random way to Lottie in the hall, as she comes in. â€œWhereâ€™s my marmalade?â€”

Howâ€™s Mrs Woolf? Better eh? Where is she?â€ meanwhile putting down coat & umbrella & not listening to a word. Then she seemed to me as she came in gigantically tall: tailor made; with a pearl dolphin with red tongue swinging from a black ribbon; rather stouter; with her white face; prominent blue eyes; nose with a chip off the end; & small beautifully aristocratic hands. Very well: but her talk? Since nature herself could give no account of itâ€”since nature has wilfully left out some screwâ€”what chance is there for me? It touches Mr Bevan; bounces off to Wild Dayrell & the nurse who cut out a bit of the curtain, which was found after three hundred years to come from the curtain at Littlecote: Mrs Bevan kept hordes of goats. Mr Bevan has escaped with a Frenchwoman. His taxiâ€”a Daimler carâ€”went from Victoria to the Emporium & back again: away againâ€”then to the aerodrome. Such nonsense putting old Ribblesdale & Horner on Boardsâ€”Ly.R. was an Astor & refused to let a penny of hers be investedâ€”Your friend Miss Shreiner has gone to Bankok. Dont you remember all her boots and shoes in Eaton Square? To tell the truth I remembered neither Shreiner, her boots, or Eaton Square. Then Herman Norman is back & says things are in an awful mess at Teheran.

â€˜Heâ€™s my cousinâ€™ I said.

Hows that? Off we went on to Normans. Leonard & Ralph were having tea meanwhile & sometimes intercepted a whiff of grapeshot. Now all this, properly strung together, would make a very amusing sketch in the style of Jane Austen. But old Jane, if she had been in the mood, would have given all the other thingsâ€”no, I dont think she would; for Jane was not given to general reflections; one cant put in the shadows that appear curving round her, & giving her a sort of beauty. She quiets downâ€”though believing the old doctrine that talk must be incessantâ€”& becomes humane, generous; shows that humorous sympathy which brings everything into her scopeâ€”naturally; with a touch of salt & reality; she has the range of a good novelist, bathing things in their own atmosphere too, only all so fragmentary & jerky. She told me she had no wish to live. â€œIâ€™m very happyâ€ she said, Oh yes, very happyâ€”But why should I want to go on living? What is there to live for? Your friends?â€”My friends are all dead. Ozzie? Oh heâ€™d do just as well without me. I should like to tidy things up & disappear.

But you believe in immortality?  
â€œNo: I donâ€™t know that I doâ€”Dust & ashes, I say.â€  
She laughed of course; & yet, as I say, has somehow the all round imaginative view which makes one believe her. Certainly I likeâ€”is love the word for these strange deep ancient affections, which began in youth, & have got mixed up with so many important things? I kept looking at her large pleasant blue eyes, so candid & generous, & hearty & going back to Fritham & Hyde Park Gate.

But this doesnâ€™t make a picture, all the same. I feel her somehow to be the sketch for a woman of genius. All the fluid gifts have gone in; but not the boney ones.
