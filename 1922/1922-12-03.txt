### Sunday 3 December

I should be at Aeschylus, for I am making a complete edition, text, translation, & notes of my ownâ€”mostly copied from Verrall; but carefully gone into by me. But these are historic days. The Hogarth Press is in travail. Heinemanns made us a most flattering offerâ€”to the effect that we should give us our brains & blood, & they would see to sales & ledgers. But we sniff patronage. If they gain, we lose. Our name has to be coupled with theirs. In the opinions of Desmond, Clive, Roger & I think Vanessa, the exchange would be capitulation. We are both very willing to come to this conclusion, & have decided for freedom & a fight with great private glee. This brought on an argument with Ralph last Friday. We must have a whole timer in January, or close down partially. After some demur, he brought forth a plan obviously concocted at Tidmarsh, by which we are to become a company, with Noel Câ arrington. for London manager, Lytton, L. & I for partners, with Ralph remaining as he is. Lytton is said to hint a possibility that we should have all his work. At first tempting, this plan becomes to us less & less feasible; considering that we should have to keep N.C. in work, be ready to tackle an enormous commercial success, & fall more & more, so we suspect, into readers & advisers to the firm of Partridge & Carrington, who would become by force of circumstances, commercial mainly with only a dab of Hogarth gold left on top. At this moment we incline to Miss Tomson & freedom. Let P. & Carrington start their own press, & go ahead for ourselves, gradually branching as opportunity occurs. One is much attracted by the idea of a keen worker; & to tell the truth, Noel did not give either of us the desire to strive for him. Why, after all, should we conciliate Ralph? And is it not better to end this perpetual strain of friendshipâ€™s burdenâ€”hurting Lyttonâ€™s feelings that is, by failing to consider how fast poor R.â€™s heart beats after a conversation with us? Such, in short, are the reasons which come to the front; & we have to refuse to talk Hogarth matters, for the discussion is endless. Tomorrow, Ralph is going to lay before us a definite proposal on the part of Lytton.

But there is serious reason, & not mere restlessness, in our need for re-organisation. We are both giving all our spare time, & still there is far more work than we can do. Jacob has sold, I think, 850; with review copies 950; there is an ominous slackening of Simkinâ€™s orders this last week, which shows, perhaps, that the rush is over. But we shall broach our second edition, & shall not lose, even if we sell no more, more than Â£10; so I am satisfied. But the books press. There are now Miss Hobhouseâ€™s diary, & Stephen Reynoldsâ€™ letters to be read & considered, & at this rate, we have work for not 3 people but 4 or 5 or 6.

This autumn has been perhaps the busiest of my dilatory life. People & booksâ€”I sing that to the tune of Woman & Wine, which comes in the Beggars Opera. I dined with Mary on Friday, met Clive & Aldous; Aldous very long, rather puffy, fat faced, white, with very thick hair, & canary coloured socks, is the raconteur; the young man of letters who sees life. We all said we despised reviewers & told little stories to our own advantage. Both the gentlemen had been complimented by Maxâ€”but not the lady. At first one thinks the
