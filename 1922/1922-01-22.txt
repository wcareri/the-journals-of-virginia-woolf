### Sunday 22 January

â€˜Tonight my reading beginsâ€™ did I say? And two nights later I was shivering over the fire & had to tumble into bed with the influenza. How describe the fortnights lapse? Happily, it has been a mitigated lapseâ€”not complete like the summerâ€™s. Again I have a gallery of little bright portraits hanging against the wall of my mindâ€”Nessaâ€”Boboâ€”Bobâ€”Kotâ€”Pippaâ€”to be exact; Nessa just back from France, alighting for a fortnight, & then off again, leaving the children, who have meanwhile got influenza, to Paris. But what am I to say about her? All very gay in French boots, hat, & check skirt; with that queer antique simplicity of surface which I compare to the marble cheeks of a Greek statue. I mean her attitude to Clive.

â€œIts a great pityâ€ she said. â€œMary is a stupid little woman. There she was at the station to meet us. Theyâ€™ve settled down together completely. I never thought it possible after the Guano. Sheâ€™s a very nice womanâ€”quite simple & straightforward.â€  
â€œIts ruining himâ€ I said. â€œHe talks about writing like a fashionable man, now. And if Maryâ€™s there, heâ€™s intolerable.â€  
â€œYesâ€ said Nessa. Her acceptance of all this is complete; perfectly open, unresentful, philosophic.  
But can I bind myself to go through my hoopsâ€”Bob & Bobo & the rest?  
Iâ€™d rather try a general â€œaccount of my friendsâ€ to match one I made two or three years ago.

Suppose I visualise them as a group of marbles with myself in the midst?â€”& now one drawing near, & then another rolling off into a corner? Itâ€™s Desmond that has rolled into the corner this time. I dont know how it came about. Fundamentally, it is chance; that I was ill, & he in Ireland, & then he dines out, & has to be at the office, & so on & so on. Only there are seasons when he breaks through these hindrances persistently, & even has to be warded off (by Leonard that is for I never manage that); whereas, now, for the past 8 months, since the dinner when we hid Miss Green behind a screen, we have never seen him. Eight monthsâ€”& life consists of how many months? Thatâ€™s what I begin to say to myself, as I near my 40th birthday. The machinery for seeing friends is too primitive: one should be able to see them by telephoneâ€”ring up, & be in the same room. Only there is loneliness to be considered tooâ€”this exacting brainâ€”this spirit which wont entirely accommodate itself to company. One person one must have, like air to breathe; butâ€”as for the rest? Still I donâ€™t like missing Desmond; & I blame myself a little for writing sharply in the N.S. (but I was right) about women; & I find myself condemning him for a penny a liner on good terms with his public.

Lyttonâ€™s marble is very close. I think he has determined, partly owing to his fame, to stick tight to one or two rocks, & his friends are one of them. So we are asked to Tidmarsh, & meetings are very carefully cherished, when they occur. His flame burns very pure. No masses of superfluity intervene. We have burnt up all that long ago. (Here mercifully I am compelled to stop in order to rule some blue lines. This is still influenza writing, or Iâ€™m inhibited by Dr. Fergussonâ€™s prohibition. No work for 2 or 3 weeks, he says. But I fancy I shall finish Hardy tomorrow.)

And I could only find a black pencil. But the truth is that when one is seeing people often & intimately one cannot say very much about it. I donâ€™t see Lytton far enough away to have a clear view of him.

On the other hand, Sydney has almost vanished into the fog. Yesterday he loomed up againâ€”for the first time sinceâ€”? He hasnâ€™t been here for 9 months perhaps. He wants to come back. But as during his absence, I have had reports of his infidelity Iâ€™m going to hum & haw a little. I doubt that he is faithful or unfaithful. And he lives in the pigstyâ€”by which I mean the Murrys & the Sullivans & the Gertlers.

Iâ€™ve no quarrels to record. Now I come to think of it Iâ€™m on excellent terms with Clive, with Maynard, with Mary, for anything I know to the contrary. We should get on admirably on a desert island, if Mary could go behind a rock; but London, this January 1922, is not a desert island, & though we meet each other in the street now & again, the conditions donâ€™t make for intimacy. Thereâ€™s Saxonâ€”at the end of the telephone. Infinitely weary, bored, irritable, even yawning audibly as he spoke, was he last nightâ€”grudging other people, so I thought, even their influenzas. What one envies more than anything is simply life. We all live, this way or that: Saxon has never quite got the hang of itâ€”nor Adrian either, I fancy, though Karin obscures Adrian rather effectively. We dined there, perhaps I forgot to record, & bawled like Margate boys.

The Pope is dying today; & the Irishmen have come to terms. The church bells ring, & though it is 10 minutes to eleven I canâ€™t see the face of the clock, nor even the trees in the garden. The birds wake us with their jangling about 7 oâ€™clock; which I take to be a sign of spring, but then I am always optimistic. A thick mist, steam coloured, obscures even twigs, let alone Towers Place. Why do I trouble to be so particular with facts? I think it is my sense of the flight of time: so soon Towers Place will be no more; & twigs, & I that write. I feel time racing like a film at the Cinema. I try to stop it. I prod it with my pen. I try to pin it down.
