### Monday 6 March

The cat lets this mouse run a few steps once more. I have walked for 10 minutes only, according to the directions of Dr Sainsbury, who after examining me for an hour saidâ€”many things; among them that we canâ€™t go abroad. But I am back again, after 2 months this very day, sitting in my chair after tea, writing; & I wrote Jacob this morning, & though my temperature is not normal, my habits are: & that is all I care for. No more lounging & drowsing & doctors visits of a morning, I hope. Yet I no longer feel very trustful. And Ralph may be in any moment to stop these reflections.
