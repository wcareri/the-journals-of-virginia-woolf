### Friday 23 June

I was telling lies to Dorothy Bussy the other day about this very bookâ€”how I lived in writingâ€”& wrote & wrote in the streetsâ€”& coming home floated it off here. I think Iâ€™ve been working too hard; talking too much; to open this book. Working at copying Jacob after tea. That, of course, deserves a page or twoâ€”my premonitory shivers. As for the talk, it has been all about love & lies with Ralph. We have had a mad bull in the houseâ€”a normal Englishman in love; & deceived. My comments could fill a book, & perhaps will fill a book. I donâ€™t find it possible to excuse all, as tradition exacts, & Ralph agrees that it should exact. In short, I donâ€™t like the normal when it is at 1000 horse power. His stupidity, blindness, callousness, struck me more powerfully than the magic virtues of passion. And yet it was interestingâ€”very genuine, on his part; save for the flimsy disguise with which he tried to excuse himself. I began by believing his storyâ€”that C. had lied in matters of such importance that their relations were now forever damaged. But he concealed some essentials; how he had treated her, so as to foster lies. She supplied some very queer facts, one, that he flew into a passion (& his passions are like those in books) because she got naked with V. DobrÃ©e. And he thinks this fine. â€œBut I am like that.â€ â€œYouâ€™re a maniacâ€ I said. Indeed I shouted it in the train coming back from Rogerâ€™s lecture. I lost my temper. We bellowed across the trains rattling. He foxes his eyes; turns rose pink; looks like taking aim at a rabbit. Shouts louder & louder. â€œI should have left you if you had treated me like that.â€ He does not answer. That is his good point. Old Victorian sherry drinking Squire though he is, one can launch out at him, & he is trained enough to stand fire. She is far subâ tler & more civilised; a lier, I daresay; but then one must lie to children. After this, & I think a little on account of my bellowing, a reconciliation took place. At least he chatters again today, & wonâ€™t allude to it. Lytton is gone, & so is Valentine. But I sketch this, partly from discretion, partly from haste, & so leave out the links. It was the stupidity of virility that impressed meâ€”& how, having made those convenient railway lines of convention, the lusts speed along them, unquestioning. She is not in loveâ€”with anyone, I expect; though Lytton has the afterglow of any passion she has. & this queers R.â€™s pitch.

Now I have little time for anything else. We have seen a great many people. Rogerâ€™s lectures provide a rendezvous. Eliot dined last Sunday & read his poem. He sang it & chanted it rhythmed it. It has great beauty & force of phrase: symmetry; & tensity. What connects it together, Iâ€™m not so sure. But he read till he had to rushâ€”letters to write about the London Magazineâ€”& discussion thus was curtailed. One was left, however, with some strong emotion. The Waste Land, it is called; & Mary Hutch, who has heard it more quietly, interprets it to be Tomâ€™s autobiographyâ€”a melancholy one. Yes, Mary kissed me on the stairs. That was after the Memoir Club. Lytton & Morgan read; & our standard is such that little is left for me to hint & guess at. They say what they mean, very brilliantly; & leave the dark as it was before. Then Mary crossed the room & purred in my ear. Molly grows very deaf, & I scold myself for not sitting next her. She puts her chin on her hand & looks wistfully round: says random rather disconsolate things. Morgan, who is now out & about again, thanks to Leonardâ€™s advice, very calm, serene, like a kettle boiling by some private fire, a fire at Weybridge, spent the night here after the Dinner, & then we sat round the table & discussed his book. Our list grows more & more distinguished, but why is there no boom in Tolstoi? No one buys Karn, or Fredegond; but Bunin sells now fairly well. Jacob, as I say, is being typed by Miss Green, & crosses the Atlantic on July 14th. Then will begin my season of doubts & ups & downs. I am guarding myself in this way. I am going to be well on with a story for Eliot, lives for Squire, & Reading, so that I can vary the side of the pillow as fortune inclines. If they say this is all a clever experiment, I shall produce Mrs Dalloway in Bond Street as the finished product. If they say your fiction is impossible, I shall say what about Miss Ormerod, a fantasy. If they say, You canâ€™t make us care a damn for any of your figuresâ€”I shall say, read my criticism then. Now what will they say about Jacob? Mad, I suppose: a disconnected rhapsody: I donâ€™t know. I will confide my view to this book on re-reading. On rereading novels is the title of a very laborious, yet rather gifted article, for the Supt. And Leonard is going to make Â£3,000 a year, via Mr & Mrs Holt, an incredible couple, who spent an incredible afternoon with us at Monks. â€œHe sells everythingâ€”heâ€™ll be selling me nextâ€ she says, very arch.

Mr Holt half winked, & cocked his head.  
â€œLittle woman, little womanâ€ said Mr Holt.  
â€œHeâ€™s the straightest boy that ever livedâ€ said Mrs Holt, not without emotion.  
â€œNo thereâ€™s nothing to be done with books. Henry isnâ€™t at all keen I should try. Henry made Â£30 by an hours work this morning. He keeps his mother, & his orphan sister & her child in a semi detached house with two maids. Everything as nice as it can be.â€

Mr Holt looked L. straight in the eyesâ€”liked to talk business aloneâ€”praised the house & garden too lavishly. Very much in the style of a best seller himself. Perfectly unreal, sentimental, & not, in spite of Mrs Holt, very straight, I should say.
