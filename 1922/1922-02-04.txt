### Saturday 4 February

Another fortnight spent in bed. Indeed, almost as I put down my pen I was seized with a second attack, lay in bed like a piece of timber, & am still in bed, sitting up, looking at the fire, the tree twigs hung with drops of aquamarine, & my temperature a shade above normal. I think this second attack was more wearisome than the first, & I have seen very few people. Nessa came again. How painful these meetings are! Let me try to analyse. Perhaps it is that we both feel that we can exist independently of the other. The door shuts between us, & life flows on again & completely removes the trace. That is an absurd exaggeration. The truth is she was a little depressed, ostensibly because no one had mentioned painting to her in the course of three weeks. â€œI have seen all the cleverest people, she said, & not one asked me about the South of France. Nobody mentioned painting. I hung two of our latest paintings in Maynardâ€™s room, & he never noticed them.â€

â€œSurely Clive?â€ I said.  
â€œOh Clive knows nothing whatever about itâ€ she replied. All this tends to make her turn to Paris as her dwelling place. But then there are the children, Julian at school, Quentin coming home nightly. And then there is Duncan. â€œAnd after all there is nothing binding in our relationshipâ€, she said. â€œIts quite different from yours.â€

And so this ruffled me: donkey that I amâ€”am susceptible to the faintest chord of dissonance twelve fields away. I set out to prove that being childless I was less normal than she. She took offence (the words are too strong). Told me I shouldnâ€™t enjoy cafÃ© life in Paris. Told me I liked my own fireside & books & my friends visits; implied that I was settled & unadventurous. Implied that I spent a great deal upon comfort. As we had only 2 hours together, & she left for Paris next morning, & perhaps I shant see her till May, anyhow not continuously, I felt a sort of discontent, as the door closed behind her. My life, I suppose, did not very vigorously rush in.

Indeed, we are at the moment a little tremulous again. What to do about Ralph?â€”about the Press? Mrs Manning Sanders forges ahead. She has reached the printing off stage, which means that Ralph works in the basement, & leaves the machine dirty. We had tea at 4 yesterday, & I made myself agreeable. â€œAnd the type will be dry for me tomorrow?â€ I said, having dissed wet type laboriously all the afternoon.

â€œNo it is not washed yetâ€ he said. Then vanished.

L. was struggling with the fire. When the door shut I understoodâ€”L. was white with rageâ€”that R. had slipped off leaving L. to go down & clean up. If he had apologised, this would have been bad enough; but to slink away, like a shamefaced schoolboy, was outrageous, & I was furious. L. had been at work all day; & now had another hour in the cold.

Upon this crystallised all our grumblings of the pastâ€”They are to the effect that he is lazy, undependable, now industrious, now slack, unadventurous, all corroded by Lytton, canâ€™t praise, yet has no view of his ownâ€”the old story, which one has heard so often from the victims of the old serpent, but rather a serious detraction from his merits, as a partner in an enterprise. Should the enterprise be modified? Should we part company? Should we hire a woman drudge? I suspect that the work is not possible for an educated & vigorous young man: but I am being charitable.
