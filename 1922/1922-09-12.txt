### Tuesday 12 September

Lytton drove off an hour ago; & I have been sitting here, unable to read or collect myselfâ€”such is the wreckage dealt by 4 days of conversation. We had the Sangers once, & Shanks last night, so we lashed our tongues lavishly. A bitter wind blew splinters of sunshine. On Sunday it pouredâ€”as it has now once more started to do.

I told Lytton I should try to write down his talkâ€”which sprang from a conversation about Boswell. But said Lytton, I never do talk. But you are witty, so they say, I replied. Lytton had of course read Mrs Thrale. And then we talked about Gibbon, whose method of dealing with the approach of the barbarian is quite magnificent. One night he gave us a complete account of the prison system, based on reports which he has been readingâ€”thoroughly, with mastery, & a kind of political ability which impresses me. He would have been an admirable ruler of an Indian province. However, as usual, there was one main theme to which we returnedâ€”Ralph & Carrington. There are two questions to be settledâ€”R. & Vâ alentine Dâ obree (who is settled in London) & R. & his livelihood. Both weigh upon poor old Lytton who feels himself in the position of a father, is slightly in love, yet sees, with his usual candour, all the faults & drawbacks. Ralph, too, lays the responsibility much on himâ€”for the Hogarth Press that isâ€”he refuses to discuss his love affairs, & Lytton sees, apprehensive & cautious as he is, how easily one might take the wrong line, & break off all communications. And so we discussed possible plansâ€”that they should buy Suffield; that we should move into 38 Brunswick Square; that R. should be set up in a farm; that they should live in Boulogne, so that Lytton might write indecently. Perhaps Lytton was depressed. But we said scarcely anything of â€˜our writingâ€™. Not a compliment passed. I daresay this is a healthier atmosphere than the otherâ€”it is not quite so pleasant.

Then Shanks came in last nightâ€”a snub nosed putty faced shapeless little manâ€”entirely lacking in temperament, according to Lyttonâ€”who was very silent. We chattered reviewers shop; & could not leave those rails. He tells me that the Lit. Sup. is not paying any of its contributors. Jack Squire, he said, is becoming stiff with morality. â€œThats a pretty girl,â€ says someone in the street, whereupon Jack blushes scarlet. Indeed, Shanks says that he left the London Mâ ercury because Squire refused to review Ulysses (wh. I have lent Shanks). No doubt Mrs Shanks & Miss Hawkesford somehow came in. But I gathered that Shanks does not take Squire quite so seriously as we had thought. However, I doubt that we shall get much further with a man with a boneless mind. He said he would give me mulberries. Nobody could feel sure what he thought of his evening.
