### Monday 17 July

Back from Garsington, & too unsettled to writeâ€”I meant to say read; but then this does not count as writing. It is to me like scratching; or, if it goes well, like having a bathâ€”which of course, I did not get at Garsington. But Julian said at breakfast this morning that she wanted to be rich in order to have hot baths. Philip replied that they are now laying on water. Then Julian said she wanted to put milk in her bath, if it kept her complexion. She didnâ€™t mind being a fine lady. She wanted to come to London; but â€œmummy only goes for operations & horrid things like that. I did once stay with Brett, but they wouldnâ€™t let me go again.â€ O. & P. stood by with their long cold noses peering into letters assiduously.

But this was the last 10 minutes of my stay. I donâ€™t know that any incident burnt through the long windy cold day. I liked old Birrellâ€™s stories. He is a very well matured vintage: the barrel round & tight & mellow; & the wine within bright & sweet, & not lacking tang either. At least he laid down the law very briskly about Loganâ€™s character: â€œnastyâ€â€”& Lady Colefaxâ€”a bore â€œI prefer Sir Alfred who makes all the money. When fat old gentlemen like myself go to the house, those rogueish Sitwell boys sit at the window opposite & cry through a megaphone â€˜The Ambassador from Swedenâ€™â€¦â€ His account of the society into which Logan introduced me the other day was not rosy. A general distrust, hidden satire, gorging of pate de fois gras in public, improprieties, & incessant celebrities. Birrell does itâ€”sits there, I suppose, by way of distraction; & pays for his tea by talk. Ottoline has her little green book room with the gilt pillars stuffed with pretty yellow books. There I sat, crouching over the fire, & we talked, rather on our guardâ€”a little toothless, perhaps. Much disillusioned she said she was, but now indifferent to disillusionment. So we had the case of Aldous Huxleyâ€”a pretty poor one â€œmere marionettes, not you at allâ€”mere marionettesâ€”why should mere marionettes destroy a long & cherished friendship? Yours very affectionately Aldous Huxley.â€ But mere marionettes have destroyed it. There is Murry pleading & whining to be taken in at the Bailiffs house, with a view to Oxford honours, so Birrell shrewdly said. Still we were low in toneâ€”had she not an operation on her bladder two days before? But energy ran like whips through her. Tea was a long rambling mealâ€”I had Mrs Seligman to talk to; & plunged into her hidden tragedyâ€”a boy undeveloped; & a girl dead. Her poor wretched hunted hare face lit it all up. The boy, she says, has, she knows, a most remarkable mind, but cant read at 11. Sheppard was there with his shiny Homers beneath his arm, depressed, & O. sought to raise his spirits by calling him the happiest of men.

P. drove me into Oxford this morning; & there was Miss Margesson on the platform. This takes me back to last week; my party at Loganâ€™s: at Maryâ€™s; at the Squires. Yes: I saw Lady Colefax & likened her to hard red cherries on a cheap black hat. And Lady Lewis was there, who remembered my mother before she married my father & thought her the most beautiful, the most delightful, of women â€œâ€”youâ€™re very good looking, too, but not like herâ€.

One gets flattered & stimulated at these places; & I found myself thinking of fame, & seeing doors open before me; but I was too much of a coward to walk in to Kent House the next day to meet la Princesse de Polignac, Lytton Strachey, & others. But one of these days no doubt I shall. But to make one love literatureâ€”this is the way. I have skimped all this disgracefully, & here vow to stitch myself a new book, & start fresh at Rodmell.

The 1917 Club has opened its new rooms, & is infested with Mayors & Husseys, (who has written a book in the style of Lytton).

Leonard has been offered Brailsfordâ€™s post on the Nation; & has taken it, short of note writing. He is quit of The Contemporary in January.

Philip is back, & installed at Waddesden.  
I am finishing Jacobâ€™s Room.  
Grizzel now belongs to us.  
I have seen Hope, Logan, Lady Cromer, Hussey, Duncan, & I donâ€™t know who all this last week, but have said nothing.

We dine in the drawing roomâ€”the dining room being given over to print & Ralph (he annoys us both considerably). My temp, goes on, as usual, & Dr Hamill thinks that my right lung is suspicious. Fergusson says no. And perhaps I shall have to see Sainsbury to settle it.
