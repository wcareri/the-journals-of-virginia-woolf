### Saturday 14 October

I was interrupted in this, & now Kitty is buried & mourned by half the grandees in London; & here I am thinking of my book. Kitty fell, very mysteriously, over some bannisters. Shall I ever walk again? she said to Leo. And to the Dr â€œI shall never forgive myself for my carelessnessâ€. How did it happen? Some one presumably knows, & in time I shall hear. Nessa regrets her, but says that the breach came through Kitty. â€œIt seems rather melancholy that it should come to an end like thisâ€ Nessa said; but she was putting Angelica to bed, & we could not dig in our past.

I have seen Nessa, Maynard, Lydia, Desmond, Saxon, Lytton, Frankie Birrell & Marjorie Fry, all within this week; & had two letters, from Lytton & Carrington, about Jacobâ€™s Room, & written I donâ€™t know how many envelopes; & here we are on the verge of publication. I must sit for my portrait to John oâ€™Londonâ€™s on Monday. Richmond writes to ask that date of publication may be put ahead, so that they may notice it on Thursday. My sensations?â€”they remain calm. Yet how could Lytton have praised me more highly? prophecies immortality for it as poetry, is afraid of my romance; but the beauty of the writing &c. Lytton praises me too highly for it to give me exquisite pleasure; or perhaps that nerve grows dulled. I want to be through the splash & swimming in calm water again. I want to be writing unobserved. Mrs Dalloway has branched into a book; & I adumbrate here a study of insanity & suicide: the world seen by the sane & the insane side by sideâ€”something like that. Septimus Smith?â€”is that a good name?â€”& to be more close to the fact than Jacob: but I think Jacob was a necessary step, for me, in working free. And now I must use this benignant page for making out a scheme of work.

I must get on with my reading for the Greek chapter. I shall finish the Prime Minister in another weekâ€”say 21st. Then I must be ready to start my Essay article for the Times: say on the 23rd. That will take say till 2nd Nov. Therefore I must now concentrate on Essays: with some Aeschylus. & I think begin Zimmern, making rather a hasty end of Bentley, who is not really much to my purpose. I think that clears the matter upâ€”though how to read Aeschylus, I donâ€™t quite know: quickly, is my desire, but that, I see, is an illusion.

Our great interview with Lytton as to Ralph came off on Thursday. Lytton was extremely adroit, & made points which Ralph promptâ [l]â y gave away. For Ralph will stay on any terms. Lytton proposes that we should give him complete business control; but this is coupled with his decision on no account to increase his hours of work. Iâ€™m rather in the mood to say that I wonâ€™t give serious books to a manager who wont give up his chicken breeding to look after them. And then how far could L. stand & watch Ralphâ€™s howlers? And lunch & tea with Ralph for ever? And Whitall? This accumulates. We are to go to Tidmarsh after the rush is over & excogitate. As for my views about the success of Jacob, what are they? I think we shall sell 500: it will then go on slowly, & reach 800 by June. It will be highly praised in some places for â€˜beautyâ€™; will be crabbed by people who want human character. The only review I am anxious about is the one in the Supt.: not that it will be the most intelligent, but it will be the most read & I cant bear people to see me downed in public. The Wâ estminster Gazette will be hostile; so, very likely, the Nation. But I am perfectly serious in saying that nothing budges me from my determination to go on, or alters my pleasure, so whatever happens, though the surface may be agitated, the centre is secure.
