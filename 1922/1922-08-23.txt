### Wednesday 23 August

A headache: no writing; so I will copy.

Aug. 21 1922  
My Dear Virginia,  
The atmosphere was extraordinarily propitious; such an effluence of beauty from the landscape & the air, with that healing touch that Iâ€™ve always found in those parts, but there was more than that. As the hours slipped by, so few & so fast, I felt more & more a deep satisfaction at having begun again with you at having picked up broken pieces & being able to hold them together with some firmness. I hope it isnâ€™t imaginary; it seems quite solid, like something really won & earned, a real step forward in this horrific pilgrimage in which weâ€™re all engaged. I might so easily have come away feeling it had been merely a raking over of ashes; I was quite prepared for that; my mind was open. But on the contrary! I feel enriched & alive, delighted to think you are there & are you, & not even minding a bit if you think Iâ€™m a perfect ass. Now for an excitement. I was just beginning to write this when the telephone rung. Bewildering noises, with shouts of â€˜I cant hear youâ€™ from me, a voice I seemed to know, & then I caught a name: â€˜Katherine?â€™ â€˜Sydney, are you my enemy?â€™ â€˜Good God, NO!â€™ Sheâ€™s in Brettâ€™s house at Hampstead. Thats all I could make out. Iâ€™m going to see her on Wednesday. The plot thickens.  
Ever yours  
S.W.
