### Wednesday 19 July

I will seize the opportunity of tea being done, Ralph gone, & Leonard writing letters, to pay some of my dues here. I put aside Mary to write about. One very cold wet night last week, or week before, she dined with me, alone, Leonard out, no servants; rain making the streets swim. I opened the door, & there she was with her white Pierrot face, black satin, orange shawl, laced shoesâ€”the whole outfit merely to dine with me in the rain. She is an impulsive generous woman, whose generosity still exists; but subterraneously I think, floored over by her society varnish, & only let issue by people who donâ€™t compete. She started off upon her treatment by Vanessa, & this was the object of her visit, I suspect; to get me, I mean, to act ambassador. But, at my age, I tend to believe in the moment, more than in posthumous reflections. She was nice enough to me, chattering about her new dress for Chrissie's party; &, whether I was deluded or not I dont know, but she seemed able to put up some defence against my literary observations. That she may repel me with Tomâ€™s arguments is no doubt true. All I maintain (& I maintain this against Nessa & Leonard) is that she showed up well on that occasion; & indeed I suspect that Nessa unintentionally flattens her more than she suspects. The situation is against nature. Nature outs, under disguise, which of course complicates. Sitting at the kitchen table at no. 50 I had this out with Nessa; & I remember how pleased I was to be taking my ease there, & not tiptoeing in the cold at Lady Colefaxâ€™sâ€”to meet the Princesse de Polignac. Nothing can be done says Nessa. Moreover, nothing needs to be done, since in October Clive sets up at no. 50, & can entertain Mary there. In fact, says Nessa, all this palaver about friendship with N. is merely a selfseeking device to improve M.â€™s own position, which, in the autumn, may need re-inforcing. And M. has set Clive against Lydia, & so turned off Maynard; & then one night she kissed Roger, & set afloat the usual contrary stories; altogether, her character is too much in holes for this last attempt to patch it up, & my embassy was fruitless. The truth is, as I am fond of beginning my sentence, that alliances of this kind always cut grooves somewhere or otherâ€”being contrary to all passion; & you cant, even in 1922, do what Plato & Shakespeare couldnâ€™t do. No intelligence bridles the old hagâ€”nature, to wit.

Ralphâ€™s old hag is temporarily under control. Today he has a story that Maynard & Lytton are to buy the English Review from Austin Harrison, set him up as drudge, pay their contributors Â£10.10. a thousand words, & beat all rivals. If Ralph wants it, then I think Lytton may agree; not otherwise. At Garsington they were getting up a subscription to give Tom Â£300, & so free him from journalism. These two bits of gossip seem to belong together; & there was a thirdâ€”that the Nation contributors have signed a Round Robin asking that Murry be removedâ€”which leads naturally to Sydney Waterlow the other nightâ€”Yes, he dined here, in his pearl tie pin. I thought him sweeter, more reasonable, than usual. He has lost his last shreds of belief in Murry, save in Murryâ€™s Criticism, but as this too, depends upon spites & whims, I donâ€™t think even that can be saved from the wreck. Sydney is very proud of his lawn & his fruit trees. He wishes his children were bigger. The little boy promises to be intelligent. Parents never mask their pride successfully. How proud Philip & Ottoline were because Julian could say Prufrock by heart! But bitterness struggles with Ottolineâ€™s pride. â€œHalf a dozen tennis balls are quite enough. You only leave them out in the wet.â€ â€œI dont leave them out in the wet, Mummyâ€,â€”typical of many breakfast talks, no doubt. But Sydney is softer, for the moment, & did not blow & bellow as much as usual.

Now, I never talked to Hussey (who is Mrs Enfield) about her book, though she accosted me in the Club for that purpose, for these reasons. She doeâ sâ nâ€™t praise my writing. She imitates Lytton. And she doesnâ€™t know the art of reading. Never, for goodness sake, set yourself to read Balzac through & talk about it. If you must do these athletics, do them in the bathroom. Somehow the connection between life & literature must be made by women: & they so seldom do it right. There was Hussey stalking beside me to the London Library (though I wished to be alone) & mincing out highly intelligent remarks beneath the horses noses, about seeing things like God & setting the cap on, & I so much rather sheâ€™d talk about her cat, her cook, or her weekly bills. But, of course, she didnâ€™t praise me. And she marries the dullest man in London, & they travel in Italy. What is worth while? Only feeling things for yourselfâ€”& this, I dont think poor Hussey dares do. One might feel, for example, that Ralph was a bore, & Balzac sometimes dull. Can you like Balzac if you like Ralph? Thatâ€™s what I ask myself when I talk to Hussey. She is an ironmongers daughter, & thus the chain of Lytton galls her neck.
