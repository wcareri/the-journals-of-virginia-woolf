This book dwindles, now that I draw my stream off in the morning. Were it not for the irritation of suspenseâ€”Nelly & Lottie: the hospital; the operation, & my own raging toothacheâ€”by which I designate my desire to be writing out the preface to Reading, I should let this page lie blank. Yet many portraits are owed to itâ€”I have seen peopleâ€”& people. Eliot, Clive, Violet,â€”if no one else. Of these Eliot amuses me mostâ€”grown supple as an eel; yes, grown positively familiar & jocular & friendly, though retaining I hope some shreds of authority. I mustnâ€™t lick all the paint off my Gods. He is starting a magazine; to which 20 people are to contribute; & Leonard & I are among them! So what does it matter if K.M. soars in the newspapers, & runs up sales skyhigh? Ah, I have found a fine way of putting her in her place. The more she is praised, the more I am convinced she is bad. After all, thereâ€™s some truth in this. She touches the spot too universally for that spot to be of the bluest blood.

â€œIâ€™ve ceased even to think about Murry. Iâ€™ve forgotten all about himâ€ said Tom.

What, then, did we discuss? He has written a poem of 40 pages, which we are to print in the autumn. This is his best work, he says. He is pleased with it; takes heart, I think, from the thought of that safe in his desk. Clive, via Mary, says he uses violet powder to make him look cadaverous. Thus it appears that Mary is not on good terms with Tom; & that I am seeing Clive rather frequently. He comes on Wednesdays; jolly, & rosy, & squab: a man of the world; & enough of my old friend, & enough of my old lover, to make the afternoons hum. One a week is probably enough. His letters suggest doubts. But, oh dear me, after 9 weeks claustration, I want to vault the wall, & pick a few flowers. The ethical code of Bloomsbury allows poaching; & Iâ€™m amused to see how far their ethics are merely theoretic. Moreover, & more seriously, a change of relationship, a middle aged relationship, offers new experiences.

Then I hit Morgan on the wing. He had come to London that very day, & so came here, & was, we thought, depressed to the verge of inanition. To come back to Weybridge, to come back to an ugly house a mile from the station, an old, fussy, exacting mother, to come back having lost your Rajah, without a novel, & with no power to write oneâ€”this is dismal, I expect, at the age of 43. The middle age of bâ€”â€”s is not to be contemplated without horror. But he was charming, transparent; & told us as much as we could get out. A years absence fills one too full for many drops to issue upon turning the bottle upside down. He told us about the sparrows that fly about the Palaceâ€”No one troubles about them. â€œI used to shout at them sometimes. One got caught in the electric wire. There it hung, until it wrenched its claw off & flew away. The squirrels sat on the piano. There is a great quarrel between the elder branch & the younger branch. The younger branch came to the festival of the God. He treated me very nicely, & hoped to see more of me. â€œIf I thought they would treat you with decent politeness, I should be only too glad that you should goâ€ the Rajah said. I used to row on the lake which was nice. The Indians were too heavy to row. There were black hills. A very nice climate, but dull. There were sparrows only. In other parts the birds were so lovelyâ€”I thought of you Virginia (which pleased me). I dont believe in native states any more. Agitators donâ€™t exist there. If they come, they disappear. It is a very nice life; but one wants other people to talk to. It is much nicer than this. I felt no enthusiasm at seeing my native cliffs again.â€ That was obvious. Off he went, carrying a very heavy metal plate, to dine with Aunt Rosalie at Putney.
