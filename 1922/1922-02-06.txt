What a sprightly journalist Clive Bell is! I have just read him, & see how my sentences would have to be clipped to march in time with his.

Mrs Manning Sanders is a bob haired, wide mouthed woman, dressed in a velvet dressing gown, plump, sandy-haired with canine brown eyes far apart. We liked her. But to Ralph her Fitzroy St origin was against herâ€”this is his rule of thumb measureâ€”for God knows, he said nothing, & is hard & angular as a block of wood. However, we had Mrs M.S. from 5 to 7.15.
