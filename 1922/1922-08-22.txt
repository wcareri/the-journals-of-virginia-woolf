### Tuesday 22 August

On this day, I donâ€™t know how many years ago, 1897 to be precise, Jack came to Hindhead & was accepted by Stella in the moonlit garden. We wandered about the house till she came in & told us. Thoby thought they were tramps. I tried to describe the little trees in the moonlight. Jack was accepted in Tyndallâ€™s little study on that bare heath twenty five years ago. As she died so soon after, somehow it still seems to me like a real thing, unsmothered by the succeeding years.

But I always have to confess, when I write diary in the morning. It is only 11.30 to be honest, & I have left off Mrs Dalloway in Bond Street; & really why is it? I should very much like to account for my depression. Sydney Waterlow spent the week end here; & yesterday we had a days outing at Brighton. At Brighton I saw a lovely blue Victorian dress, which L. advised me not to buy. Sydney reproduced in his heavy lifeless voice exactly the phrases in which Murry dismisses my writing â€œmerely sillyâ€”one simply doesnâ€™t read itâ€”youâ€™re a back number.â€ Then Squire rejected Leonardâ€™s story; & perhaps I dont like seeing new houses built all about; & get edgy about our field. So now I have assembled my factsâ€”to which I now add my spending 10/6 on photographs, which we developed in my dress cupboard last night; & they are all failures. Compliments, clothes, building, photographyâ€”it is for these reasons that I cannot write Mrs Dalloway. Indeed it is fatal to have visitors, even like Clive for one day, in the middle of a story. I had just got up steam. All that agony now has to begin again. And Sydney, however one may discount him beforehand, is always a feather bed on a hot nightâ€”ponderous, meritorious, stuffy. The stuffing is now provided by Kot & Sullivan, who have provided him with a new outfit. Everything is conscientiously revised by their not, to me, penetrating flame; & if the process is done in oneâ€™s presence it becomes, I donâ€™t know why, curiously enervating, humiliating & depressing. Some rooms always smell mouldyâ€”good well built rooms too. No one ever suffered so acutely from atmosphere as I do; & my leaves drooped one by one; though heaven knows my root is firm enough. As L. very truly says there is too much ego in my cosmos.

In fact, Sydney was lighter in hand than I have known him. He had made a vow, for at 45 he makes vows, not to discuss his personal affairs. A deep groan intimated so much when we approached the delectable subject. No: he must refrain. We passed the door. And he got naked & bathed, & made the river look many sizes too small. He is a soft pink mass when naked. We talked too much about Murry. Still, it would have been asâ câ etic not to, considering our lack of subjects of equal value. Yet Sydney considers that he can talk about literature. He can pick up a pencil doubtless; but the chances are he picks up half a dozen. I am thinking of Thoreau, whose fineness of touch was proved by some dealing of his with pencils. I mean that Sydney is entirely without fineness of touch. His grandmother was a ratcatcherâ€™s daughter: his grandfather a printerâ€™s devil: both facts which he profoundly regrets. And so do I.

I am once more writing off the fidgets. Ah, but how divinely happy we were until 12.30 on Thursday when Clive boarded the enchanted island with news from the world of Mary & Colefax! Never have I been so happy in my life. The day was like a perfect piece of cabinet makingâ€”beautifully fitted with beautiful compartments. It rained (I think) things must have happened in the same way & same order as today; but how differently! I could hardly keep my temper ordering dinner this morningâ€”& so on. But I shall walk to Asheham & try to start the machine again. The odd thing is that neither of us wishes for visitors. Of course they threaten us from all sidesâ€”Partridges, Mâ olly. Hamilton, Americans, Lytton, Morgan, Tom, Sangersâ€”no: leave me, leave me, is all I say: to work my brain.

Boen came to tea on Sundayâ€”a cheap piece of crockery, for her nose reminds one of a tea pot spout; her mouth is like a slot in coarse china. She is changing; reading Bliss under Shanksâ€™ orders; wishes to live in London in order to work; not dance; & hurried off to play tennis with him, I suppose. I surprised them on the river bank swimming the great sheep dog â€œThey got him from a shepherd hereâ€ says Boen, with a strange accent or tremor on they, as if â€˜theyâ€™ were past, yet not dead; & so, under pretext of exercising the dog, the walking out which Mrs Dedman so strongly disapproves, goes on; leading according to Sydney, to a life of misery for Shanks, Boen getting her claws into him, clinging to him, drawing him under.

â€œRot!â€ I said. Poor man. I look forward to his Collins. Tuesday cont.

Slowly the cloud withdraws. Not that I can put pen to paper at this moment; but the waters, which that great grampus dislodged, meet together again. I am once more washed by the flood, warm, embracing, fertilising, of my own thoughts. I am too feeble to analyse the psychology, which I guess to be interesting. Its as if some foreign body had dispersed reality for the moment; the foreign body being of some gross material, inimical to thought. And if I can only protect this for the present, I shall be able to write. So the question for me is, how far to withdraw from unsympathetic society in the future? Is this cowardly, or merely good sense? For instance, here is Brett already inviting us into the heart of the enemies campâ€”Hampstead Thursday evenings. If I go I shall be rasped all over, or at any rate dulled & blunted, by the presence of Sullivan, Kot & Sydney. If I donâ€™t go shall I soften & rot in the too mild atmosphere of my own familiars? Perhaps the best plan would be to live in a neutral territoryâ€”neither friend nor foe, & by this means sink the exacting claims of egoism. Is there such a society possible though?

I have ordered the blue silk dress, & must now save 10/- a week towards it.â€”six weeks that is. But if I save the money here, I waste it at the other end, so I have imposed this task upon myself with some amusement.

The way to rock oneself back into writing is this. First gentle exercise in the air. Second the reading of good literature. It is a mistake to think that literature can be produced from the raw. One must get out of lifeâ€”yes, thats why I disliked so much the irruption of Sydneyâ€”one must become externalised; very, very concentrated, all at one point, not having to draw upon the scattered parts of oneâ€™s character, living in the brain. Sydney comes & Iâ€™m Virginia; when I write Iâ€™m merely a sensibility. Sometimes I like being Virginia, but only when Iâ€™m scattered & various & gregarious. Now, so long as we are here, Iâ€™d like to be only a sensibility. By the way, Thackeray is good reading, very vivacious, with â€˜touchesâ€™, as they call them over the way at the Shankâ sâ esâ€™, of astonishing insight.

I have so many letters to write: to Jacques (& he praised Monday or Tuesday highly; & I like to please Jacques; yet Jacquesâ€™ praises never outweigh dull donkey Sydneyâ€™s dispraises) to Ka; to Carrington; toâ€”I forget; & shanâ€™t bother, but shall now rock myself into literature by reading Ulysses!
