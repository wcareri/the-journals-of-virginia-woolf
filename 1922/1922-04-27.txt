### Thursday 27 April

Just backâ€”not from the Club, but from Lopokhova & Rodmell, & fingers are so cold I cant close them on my pen. It is blackening for another downpour. This is the worst spring on record. 27 days of bitter wind, blinding rain, gusts, snowstorms, storms every day. So Rodmell was mitigated joy, & to this was added Nellyâ€™s diversion so that we had to carry coals ourselves. She left us after a week, unable to stand the bi-weekly journey to Lottie in hospital.

We saw Mayors, Nessa, & Cecils. Lady G. Cecil is much like a terrier dog in coat & skirt: worried, untidy, insignificant; ardent, masculine in talk; a terrier on a chain; a great lady much snubbed & reduced: where, I wonder, do her lines & cavities come from? The 80ties was her heyday, when she went to Glasgow with Ld Salisbury & there were 10,000 people in the station who cheered like one manâ€”(the Gordon crisis I think). Jimmy & Hugh & I spent all our pocket money & moreâ€”Jimmy was in debt for 3 years, getting up an agitation about Gordonâ€”hiring halls & speakers. Whereâ€™s that spirit now? The whole of politics is dominated by one personality in whom no one believes. Gladstone was a dishonest man if you likeâ€”but he was a great man. He had a policy. This man has nothing. Hugh tells me thereâ€™s no politics now as there was in our youth. Its a different thing. Your husband says the same. All spites & personalities. Very bad for the countryâ€”We faced each other standing still in the woods to deliver these views.
