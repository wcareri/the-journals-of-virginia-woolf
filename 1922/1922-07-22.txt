### Saturday 22 July

My conscience drives me again to write.  
â€œThis is real rainâ€ says L. at the window.  
â€œMrs Thomsett wont have to go right up somewhere to get pails of waterâ€ says Lottie.

It is pouring heavy, straight, thick. Puddles stand in the garden. It is stuffy, dirty skyed. A white mist of rain blows off the roofs. One poor plant is bent over. We have just had Saturday tea, at which we read the weeklies, & abused poor cur Murry. He slobbers over Garnett this week, which suggests that Garnett has slobbered over him. You canâ€™t write criticism without being a good man, so I maintain. One always sees the soul through words.

Clive came to tea yesterday, & offered me only the faded & fly blown remnants of his mind. He had been up late. So had Iâ€”at the pictures. For my own part, all my strings are jangled by a night out. Dissipation would rot my writing (such as it is, I put in, modestly). Words next day dance patterns in my mind. It takes me a week to recover from Lady Colefaxâ€”who by the way invites me for Friday. Col-fox = black fox. This is from my Chaucer reading. The question yesterday was about Lytton & the English Review. Would it be good or bad for his writing? Ralph says that he is depressed; blocked by the play he canâ€™t writeâ€”& never will be able to write, say I; & if he lubricated himself with journalism, he might reel off some history or biography, & so pass by the play unmoved; & this is his line, & a good one, too, I say. But Leonard thinks that my view & Ralphâ€™s are temporal compromising views, to which Lytton ought not to listen. Partly I am influenced by a wish for the fun of the thingâ€”12 numbers of a new review written by the most brilliant of the ageâ€”myself among them, paid double: London Mercury killed, &c. &c. But James is spending this wet Sunday at Tidmarsh; & James will addle the egg.

If Lytton takes it, Ralph is to be business manager, & leave us. Well? We are polite, but we donâ€™t sigh. And here is a long letter from Dobree, opened by mistake, showing that R. is in mischief again. His spirits are down, & even the servants notice his surliness. Poor young man! For really he was never meant for intellectual whirlpools. No: he was meant for punts in backwaters, gramophones, ices, flirtations, a pretty wife, large family, & interests in the City. Nature is perpetually driving him to convert Tidmarsh into the likeness of this, & so everything goes athwart him. We have bad luck with our prentices. Next time we must stipulate for eunuchs.

Hamill sticks to it that my right lung is wrong. Fergusson finds nothing. Pneumonia germs have been discovered. And my case is to be laid before Sainsbury on the 9thâ€”all rather a bore.
