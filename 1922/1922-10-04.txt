### Wednesday 4 October

Our last whole day. From the weather point of view, the summer has been altogether disappointing. It has promised & then withheld. We have not had 7 consecutive good days. There has been a scattering of good ones, but in the midst of rain, wind, & dark London looking skies. Often the Roman road was so muddy I could not walk along it. And often I heard the thunder murmuring as I walked. Grizzel was frightened & ran homeâ€”as if God would go out of his way to hurt a mongrel fox terrier walking on the flats at Rodmell! But thereâ€™s no arguing about these things. I think the garden has never been better, & we have had good crops of apples & pears, & green peas only 2 days ago.

Spiritually speaking we have made some progress in Rodmell society. I was struck by the bloodlessness of philistines the other day at the Rectory. They seem far less alive than we intellectuals. Mr Shanks & the Hoggs are, after all, so pale, so watery, so mild. Mrs Hawkesford still discusses the country & London; says, for the 20th time, that she is so glad she kept the tennis court going, even though they turned the pony on it during the war. Boen sits lackadaisical, & helps me to Shanksâ€™ cigarettes. Then I donâ€™t like underbred young menâ€”Hogg to wit. They seem to me a little peevish & conventional; & talk slang which covers any character they may have.

I am a little uppish, though, & self assertive, because Brace wrote to me yesterday â€œWe think Jacobâ€™s Room an extraordinarily distinguished & beautiful work. You have, of course, your own method, & it is not easy to foretell how many readers it will have; surely it will have enthusiastic ones, & we delight in publishing itâ€â€”or words to that effect. As this is my first testimony from an impartial person I am pleased. For one thing it must make some impression, as a whole; & cannot be wholly frigid fireworks. We think of publishing on Oct. 27th. I daresay Duckworth is a little cross with me. I snuff my freedom. It is I think true, soberly & not artificially for the public, that I shall go on unconcernedly whatever people say. At last, I like reading my own writing. It seems to me to fit me closer than it did before. I have done my task here better than I expected. Mrs Dalloway & the Chaucer chapter are finished; I have read 5 books of the Odyssey; Ulysses; & now begin Proust. I also read Chaucer & the Pastons. So evidently my plan of the two books running side by side is practicable, & certainly I enjoy my reading with a purpose. I am committed to only one Supt. articleâ€”on Essaysâ€”& that at my own time; so I am free. I shall read Greek now steadily & begin â€˜The Prime Ministerâ€™ on Friday morning. I shall read the Trilogy & some Sophocles & Euripides & a Plato dialogue: also the lives of Bentley & Jebb. At forty I am beginning to learn the mechanism of my own brainâ€”how to get the greatest amount of pleasure & work out of it. The secret is I think always so to contrive that work is pleasant.
