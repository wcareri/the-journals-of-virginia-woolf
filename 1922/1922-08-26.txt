### Saturday 26 August

Having done my morningâ€™s writing, at 11.20, & filled a whole page not so badly after all, I may as well let my brain finish its run on this more terrestrial soil. It is a fine dayâ€”one of the dozen this summer. I dont think I have said enough about the splintered disorder of June, July & August. A broken china closet it makes me think ofâ€”so many smashes & tergivasations. But today is fine, & yesterday we went to Charleston by the Bus, for the first time. After all, one must respect civilisation. This thought came to me standing in a Brighton street the other day from which one sees the downs. Mankind was fuming & fretting & shouldering each other about; the down was smoothly sublime. But I thought this street frenzy is really the better of the twoâ€”the more courageous. One must put up a fight against passive turf, with an occasional snail, & a swell in the ground which it takes 2,000 years to produce. But I daresay this thought was forced upon me: I much prefer the downs myself.

Charleston is as usual. One hears Clive shouting in the garden before one arrives. Nessa emerges from a great variegated quilt of asters & artichokes; not very cordial; a little absent minded. Clive bursts out of his shirt; sits square in his chair & bubbles. Then Duncan drifts in, also vague, absent minded, & incredibly wrapped round with yellow waistcoats, spotted ties, & old blue stained painting jackets. His trousers have to be hitched up constantly. He rumples his hair. However, I canâ€™t help thinking that we grow in cordiality, instead of drifting out of sight. And why not stand on oneâ€™s own legs, & defy them, even in the matter of hats & chaircovers? Surely at the age of fortyâ€¦. Nessa, who concentrates upon one subject, & one only, with a kind of passive ferocity which I find alarming, took L. off primarily to discuss her attitude to Mary. Clive & I are much alike in our haphazard dealings with people. We do not concentrate; we are easily gulled & flattered; we expand & contract; we chatter & gossip; there is something much more fell, stable & determined in the characters of my sister & husband. Really, they can both determine a relationship & hold to it.

As for Duncan he requires, I think, peace for painting. He would like it all settled one way or the other. We saw a perfectly black rabbit, & a perfectly black cat, sitting on the road, with its tail laid out like a strap.

â€œWhat they call an example of melanismâ€ said Cliveâ€”which amused me very much, & also made me like him. Why should this absurd trifle affect me when far more serious things make no impression whatever? And could one ever imagine this in the case of another person?

I dislike Ulysses more & moreâ€”that is think it more & more unimportant; & dont even trouble conscientiously to make out its meanings. Thank God, I need not write about it. Yes, Murry actually goes out of his way to drag in my name with moderate praise today. This must mean that he is coming to live in London; requires a dinner, anyhow people to get up & welcome him when he comes into a room.
