### Sunday 29 October

Miss Mary Butts being gone, & my head too stupid for reading, may as well write here, for my amusement later perhaps. I mean Iâ€™m too riddled with talk & harassed with the usual worry of people who like & people who donâ€™t like J.R. to concentrate. There was the Time review on Thursdayâ€”long, a little tepid, I think; saying that one canâ€™t make characters in this way; flattering enough. Of course, I had a letter from Morgan in the opposite senseâ€”the letter Iâ€™ve liked best of all. We have sold 650, I think; & have ordered a second edition. My sensations?â€”as usualâ€”mixed. I shall never write a book that is an entire success. This time the reviews are against me, & the private people enthusiastic. Either I am a great writer or a nincompoop. â€œAn elderly sensualistâ€ the Daily News calls me. Pall Mall passes me over as negligible. I expect to be neglected & sneered at. And what will be the fate of our second thousand then? So far of course, the success is much more than we expected. I think I am better pleased so far than I have ever been Morgan, Lytton, Bunny, Violet, Logan, Philip, have all written enthusiastically. But I want to be quit of all this. It hangs about me like Mary Buttsâ€™ scent. I dont want to be totting up compliments, & comparing reviews. I want to think out Mrs Dalloway. I want to foresee this book better than the others, & get the utmost out of it. I expect I could have screwed Jacob up tighter if I had foreseen; but I had to make my path as I went.

One of the perquisities of Jacob seems to be society. I am going to Ly Colefax on Tuesday to hear Valery lecture: also to Miss Sands. They are all now (momentarily, through Logan I daresay) on my side. And at the moment I feel inclined for a plunge, though it must be on my own terms: in my own clothes, & at my own hours. I canâ€™t go in to Whitallâ€™s visit at length. But our position becomes more & more complicated. Clearly we cannot go on publishing seriously with Ralph attached to us like a drone. Whitall is a greyhound looking nervous American, serious, matter of fact, forced to make money. How far do we want to make money with him? At anyrate the labour & worry of getting out a long book makes me decided not to do it again on the present system. We have to go to Tidmarsh next week to explain the position. Carrington says that Lytton is most anxious for some arrangement, & the uncertainty is trying Ralphâ€™s nerves. Yet this nervous man makes no attempt to do the most ordinary things for us. L. has to tie parcels every morning. Ralph catches no earlier or later trains. Thursday morning he spent at the tailorâ€™s. But there is the American element in Whitall to be distrustedâ€”in short it bothers us, & the election is beginning to roar in the newspapers. L. has a chance of getting in. We have bitten off a large piece of lifeâ€”but why not? Did I not make out a philosophy some time ago which comes to thisâ€”that one must always be on the move?
