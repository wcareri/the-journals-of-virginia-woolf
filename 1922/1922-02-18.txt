### Saturday 18 February

Three dozen eggs at present prices work out at 10/6. Three dozen = 36. Four eggs for breakfast work out at 28 a week. This leaves 8 over for cooking. I have an egg now every night for dinner. I make these calculations not with a view to an essay upon national economy, though that comes in. My weekly booksâ€”these are in my mindâ€”the very top layer, to be shifted off here most conveniently. For according to the papers, the cost of living is now I dont know how much lower than last year; whereas my books remain about the same. You cant question Nelly much without rubbing a sore. She threatens at once to send up a cheap meal â€œ& Mr Woolf wont like that.â€ There! Not a very grievous itch; & quelled by the sight of the new Byron letters just come from Mudieâ€™s.

Once more my mind is distracted from the thought of death. There was something about fame I had it in mind to say yesterdayâ€”oh I think it was that I have made up my mind that Iâ€™m not going to be popular, & so genuinely that I look upon disregard or abuse as part of my bargain. Iâ€™m to write what I like; & theyâ€™re to say what they like. My only interest as a writer lies, I begin to see, in some queer individuality: not in strength, or passion, or anything startling; but then I say to myself, is not â€˜some queer individualityâ€™ precisely the quality I respect? Peacock, for example: Borrow; Donne; Douglas, in Alone, has a touch of it. Who else comes to mind immediately? FitzGeraldâ€™s Letters. People with this gift go on sounding long after the melodious vigorous music is banal. In proof of this, I read that a small boy, given a book by Marie Corelli for a Sunday school prize, at once killed himself; & the coroner remarked that one of her books was not what he himself would call â€œat all a nice bookâ€. So perhaps the Mighty Atom is dwindling away, & Night & Day arisingâ€”though the Voyage Out seems at the moment most in esteem. That encourages me. After 7 years next April the Dial speaks of its superb artistry. If they say the same of N. & D. in 7 years I shall be content; but I must wait 14 for anyone to take Monday or Tuesday to heart.

I want to read Byronâ€™s Letters, but I must go on with La Princesse de ClÃ©ves. This masterpiece has long been on my conscience. Me to talk of fiction & not to have read this classic! But reading classics is generally hard going. Especially classics like this one, which are classics because of their perfect taste, shapeliness, composure, artistry. Not a hair of its head is dishevelled. I think the beauty very great, but hard to appreciate. All the characters are noble. The movement is stately. The machinery a little cumbrous. Stories have to be told. Letters dropped. It is the action of the human heart & not of muscle or fate that we watch. But stories of noble human hearts have their moments unapproachable in other circumstances. There is a quiet understated profundity in the relations between Madame de ClÃ©ves & her mother, for example. If I were reviewing it, I think I should take for my text beauty in character. Thank God though I am not reviewing it. Within the last few minutes I have skimmed the reviews in the New Statesman; between coffee & cigarette I read the Nation: now the best brains in England (metaphorically speaking) sweated themselves for I donâ€™t know how many hours to give me this brief condescending sort of amusement. When I read reviews I crush the columns together to get at one or two sentences; is it a good book or a bad? And then I discount those 2 sentences according to what I know of the book & of the reviewer. But when I write a review I write every sentence as if it were going to be tried before 3 Chief Justices: I cant believe that I am crushed together & discounted. Reviews seem to me more & more frivolous. Criticism on the other hand absorbs me more & more.

But after 6 weeks influenza my mind throws up no matutinal fountains. My note book lies by my bed unopened. At first I could hardly read for the swarm of ideas that rose involuntarily. I had to write them out at once. And this is great fun. A little air, seeing the buses go by, lounging by the river, will, please God, send the sparks flying again. I am suspended between life & death in an unfamiliar way. Where is my paper knife? I must cut Lord Byron.
