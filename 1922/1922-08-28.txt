### Monday 28 August

I am beginning Greek again, & must really make out some plan: today 28th: Mrs Dalloway finished on Sat. 2nd Sept: Sunday 3rd to Friday 8th start Chaucer: Chaucerâ€”that chapter, I mean, should be finished by Sept. 22nd. And then? Shall I write the next chapter of Mrs D.â€”if she is to have a next chapter; & shall it be The Prime Minister? which will last till the week after we get backâ€”say Oct. 12th. Then I must be ready to start my Greek chapter. So I have from today, 28th till 12thâ€”which is just over 6 weeksâ€”but I must allow for some interruptions. Now what have I to read? Some Homer: one Greek play; some Plato; Zimmern; Sheppard, as text book; Bentleyâ€™s Life. If done thoroughly, this will be enough. But which Greek play? & how much Homer, & what Plato? Then thereâ€™s the Anthology. All to end upon the Odyssey because of the Elizabethans. And I must read a little Ibsen to compare with Euripidesâ€”Racine with Sophoclesâ€”perhaps Marlowe with Aeschylus. Sounds very learned; but really might amuse me. & if it doesnâ€™t, no need to go on.
