### Thursday 3 August

Owing to the change of ink & the change of place, I here begin a new page. Twice a year I make good resolutionsâ€”in August & October. My good resolution for August is to work methodically, yet with the grain not against it. Often, my wisdom teaches me, good resolutions wither because forced. And modern science teaches us to respect pleasure, or that is my reading.

I should make one of my little addings up of days, since there is a break. On the whole a good summer; by which I mean that pleasuresâ€”dining out, seeing people,â€”were rather successfully combined with reading & writing & staying at home. On the whole, L. & I are becoming celebrities. L. would deny this; but then he did not go to Loganâ€™s tea party, nor to Garsington. Still I draw my observation from other sources. Reputation seems to accumulate, though we published nothing this year. Mrs Nicolson thinks me the best woman writerâ€”& I have almost got used to Mrs Nicolsonâ€™s having heard of me. But it gives me some pleasure. Again, I am on freer terms with my little world, & have the chance I think to expand it, only no money to buy clothes. I am horribly in debt for Joyce & Proust at this moment, & must sell books directly I get back to London.

We ended our season last Monday at the Commercio, with Clive & Roger. Roger came in with his hair flying & his coat flying carrying canvasesâ€”his mouth open, his eyes searching roundâ€”& we had our usual talk. Clive had his bits of gossip; & did I not by my evil eye inspire one of them? Mrs Shanks (so they say) has left the Georgian poet. But Tom, coming round to Gordon Square afterwards, was by no means so certain of this as I could wish. Tom was sardonic, guarded, precise, & slightly malevolent, as usual. Clive, of course, on his good behaviour. He sounded me as to a visit to Wittering. Nessa had the mumps downstairs. Duncan drifted in, soft haired, vague, gentle as usual. And Roger undid his canvases, & leant 2 portraits of Logan against the sofa. â€œYes, I think that is the best portrait I have done so farâ€ he said. â€œI think I have never carried anything quite so far as that head.â€ He is 55 I suppose; & still thinks he is about to begin to paint as he shouldâ€”a merciful dispensationâ€”a carrot to lure him across the desert. But it is no desert to Roger. Every faculty is used & burnished, & some fairly on the way to be worn out. He suffers, consults doctors, aches & shivers, but eternally goes on. The perfect man, as I told him, & as indeed I believe him to be. He is off to spend the summer painting with Derain. It is his obsession nowâ€”to paint, paint, paint. Nothing else is worth doing. Pamela is marrying, or failing to marry, her Roumanian Jew.

Yesterday I walked to the top of Asheham hill, & found colonies of mushrooms on the way. The house now looks a little rigid & fixed, the country shut in, & severe compared with this. But the garden here, with the outhouses & their ivy down, is a lovely patchâ€”open & airy with views of the hills; & so far Ted Hunter remains quiescent. The rot has set in, I hope, & I pray that Ted Hunterâ€™s wife may now elope with Mr Belloc. Allison will then lose his fortune, &, Bowen being with child by Shanks, the Hawkesfords will leave, & the Woolves be left by themselves in chastity & glory.

I must broach a new page to announce the beginning, the true not spurious beginning, of Reading this morning. I shall write next that I have never enjoyed any writing more, or felt more certain of success. Jacobâ€™s Room is crossing the Atlantic.
