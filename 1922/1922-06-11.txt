### Sunday 11 June

Disgraceful! disgraceful! disgraceful! From the 27th day of April to this, the eleventh of June, not a word has been recorded. And I only write now to excuse myself from copying out a page or two of Jacob for Miss Green. The depression of a return from Rodmell is always acute. Perhaps this continued temperatureâ€”I lost 3 teeth in vain the other dayâ€”may be some sort of cause for my ups & downs. Yet the 10 days at Rodmell passed smoothly. One lives in the brain thereâ€”I slip easily from writing to reading with spaces between of walkingâ€”walking through the long grass in the meadows, or up the downs; &â€”well I need not talk about June. Perfection is such that it becomes like a normal state. Such is â€˜weatherâ€™; & happiness is not strange but normal tooâ€”And so of course, coming back from Rodmell,â€”blankâ€”reason for blank forgotten as well as blanks contents. If I give my reason, I shall waste my time & energy.
