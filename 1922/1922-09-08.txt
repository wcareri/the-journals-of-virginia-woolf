When Mrs Woolf was here, she said she had been asked several times at Philipâ€™s wedding the meaning of the word honeymoonâ€”Mr Sturgeon has now supplied it. What things people say at weddings! She said, Again Iâ€™m a wanderer on the earth. If I could find someone to go with me, Iâ€™d buy a caravan. Now having had 10 children I am to live in 2 rooms in South Kensington. Leonard cant drink milk with the skin on. None of his family can. â€œI could see it in Mrs Woolfâ€™s eyesâ€ said Lottieâ€”a wonderful piece of psychology. Flora told me that they eat funguses in Sweden; which grow there in great quantities. They eat all except the red funguses. She found a green one & threw it away. It was one of the best. Mrs W. said that Sweden is a great knife & fork country. They think too much about eating she said. Each of these sayings seemed to me very significant at the time; though I daresay I shant be able to see why.

The Sangers came last night. Charlieâ€™s views on literature are oddly cut & dry to me. He discoursed upon languages, Latin & German: I know not why it is that people who arenâ€™t writers always give one a dry bone in oneâ€™s hand, however much they may know. He has a very low opinion of Proust, but thinks that you cant write a psychological novel in French. From French he hops to Latin, to German, to Russian: but the perches are dry.
