### Wednesday 15 February

I thought to myself, as Lytton was talking, Now I will remember this & write it down in my diary tomorrow. And as I thought that, everything melted to mist. People donâ€™t say things, except in biographies. True, Lytton was smooth & mild & melancholy beyond his wont; but with intimates, when talk is interesting, one sentence melts into another; heads & tails merge; there is never a complete beast. These I remember as opinions: Lady Gs. life of Salisbury is extremely good: Salisbury was a perfect aristocrat. The point about him was that he was a man of action simply & solely. Lady S. was stuck up & pert; they discussed travelling second class. And what else can I remember? Absolutely nothing? â€˜Latest Racineâ€™ he had read on the posters at Waterloo; thought it referred to Masefield; then re-read Racing. But he was back again in his old pre-Eminent Victorians despondency, partly, I guessed, because the publishers are chilly about his essays; partly because he canâ€™t think of a plot for a play. When I told him a history of George IVth was quite good enough, I think he was pleased. How these writers live in their workâ€”How ambition consumes them! Everything radiates from this in Lytton, & I fancy loneliness leaks in through the chinks. He gave me the first edition of a book by Beckford; a very characteristic present, & the first he ever gave me, or I him.

We disagreed violently about Percy Lubbockâ€™s book; & I traced poor dear Ralphâ€™s swift unerring insight to the original source. Its annoying to meâ€”as if Lottie picked up my gold watch & gave it a scouring with Bluebell polish (this utterly inappropriate image comes from the irritation she is just now causing me by scrubbing door plates, & turning on the electric light.) All Lyttonâ€™s subtleties & allusions come out spick & span blown through brass.

Of my reading I will now try to make some note.

First Peacock; Nightmare Abbey, & Crotchet Castle. Both are so much better than I remember. Doubtless, Peacock is a taste acquired in maturity. When I was young, reading him in a railway carriage in Greece, sitting opposite Thoby, I remember, who pleased me immensely by approving my remark that Meredith had got his women from Peacock, & that they were very charming women, then, I say I rather had to prod my enthusiasm. Thoby liked it straight off. I wanted mystery, romance, psychology I suppose. And now more than anything I want beautiful prose. I relish it more & more exquisitely. And I enjoy satire more. I like the scepticism of his mind more. I enjoy intellectuality. Moreover, fantasticality does a good deal better than sham psychology. One touch of red in the cheek is all he gives, but I can do the rest. And then theyâ€™re so short; & I read them in little yellowish perfectly appropriate first editions.

The masterly Scott has me by the hair once more. Old Mortality. Iâ€™m in the middle; & have to put up with some dull sermons; but I doubt that he can be dull, because everything is so much in keepingâ€”even his odd monochromatic landscape painting, done in smooth washes of sepia & burnt siena. Edith & Henry too might be typical figures by an old master, put in exactly in the right place. And Cuddie & Mause are as usual, marching straight away for all time, as lusty as life. But I daresay the fighting & the story telling business prevent him from going quite ahead with his gun as in the Antiquary;
