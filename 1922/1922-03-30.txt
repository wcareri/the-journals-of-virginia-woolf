### Thursday 30 March

They have decided for the operation; or rather Johnston has decided for them; & no one can overrule his finding, as he alone had the materials. Now Emma Gilman is in the house, & we have just presented a rose coloured dressing jacket. The atmosphere is a little tremulous, with that kind of significance in trivial sayings which is moving & uncomfortable. It is snowing now, large loose watery flakes; they fall straight; there is no wind: four turned to large drops hang on the branch against the window; (but I am thinking out tomorrowâ€™s writingâ€”or even skipping to the end of the book, & thinking what I shall say about Shaw). Muddy water is in the evening sky, & we began summer time last Sunday, so the evening sky is prolonged. The poor Vaughans will find it very difficult to get through the long evening; & Emma will take a turn in Kensington Gardens, or will say, as she once said to me, â€œOne always expects something of the summer; but somehow, it never seems to happen.â€ This she said some time in 1908 in Russell Square, one evening.

I am shirking Boboâ€™s rehearsal, which I meant to describe. Miss Craig is a rosy, ruddy â€˜personageâ€™ in white waistcoat, with black bow tie & gold chain loosely knotted.

Stop those monkey tricks, do Saundersâ€”& let us have some light.

Miss Craig (Saunders stands right up to the footlights & shouts through her hollowed hands:) â€œThereâ€™s a short on the battens, Miss Craig.â€

Lets have the floats thenâ€¦.

Now, all of you. I want you to listen carefully to the music. Make the movements that suggest themselves to you.

Beautiful lady, you go up to the balcony. Can you step to the left? No: I wonâ€™t take risks. Young man, Dunlop, you walk straightâ€”straight I sayâ€”straightâ€”Canâ€™t you move that table? No? Well then to the right. Miss Potter (this with some acerbity) you neednâ€™t dance.

Poor Betty looked like the skeleton of a sheep. She is at one of her crises, & may be dismissed the stage over this affair.

But it is, as usual, the atmosphere I want to get. The supple, candid, free & easy good sense of theatrical manners, as I noted them at tea. â€œMy dear boy,â€ drinking out of the same cup. Little Lanchester said, when I asked if she walked in her pyjamas, â€œOh do stop being funnyâ€â€”I dont think one could use oneâ€™s brain without being warned off. Still, it donâ€™t much matter. I walked with Miss Litvinne, mother of an illegitimate child, down Longacre, & found her like an articulate terrierâ€”eyes wide apart; greased to life; nimble; sure footed, without a depth anywhere in her brain. They go to the Cabaret; all night dances; John Goss sings. She was communicative, even admiring I think. Anyhow, I like Bohemians. Then we went into the theatre, & there was the light on, the group significant, (Boboâ€™s children) gold tissue; something stimulating & unreal.
