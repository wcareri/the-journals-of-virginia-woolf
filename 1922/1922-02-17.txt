### Friday 17 February

Iâ€™ve just had my dose of phenacetinâ€”that is to say a mildly unfavourable review of Monday or Tuesday reported by Leonard from the Dial, the more depressing as I had vaguely hoped for approval in that august quarter. It seems as if I succeed nowhere. Yet, Iâ€™m glad to find, I have acquired a little philosophy. It amounts to a sense of freedom. I write what I like writing & thereâ€™s an end on it. Moreover, heaven knows I get consideration enough.

Molly Hamilton sits for her portrait today. Her portrait, to be sure, was a little shadowed by the fact that, but for her, I should have had Lytton in the chair, & should have got more for my money. She is a crude piece of work by comparison. One of the strugglers; & thus a good deal of time must be wasted upon factsâ€”how she is to get a jobâ€”what she can live on &c. Besides, the strugglers are all worn & muscular with struggling. She is bitter against peopleâ€”seems to me to snap, as a dog does with a thorn in his foot. And something of her pleasure in seeing me is the charwomanâ€™s pleasure in talking of her bad leg: by a grate which she need not polish, & with tea things which she need not wash up. However, to give her her due, she is a warm, courageous, bustling woman; & I like her spirit, & the trophies she brings me of buffeting & rejectionâ€”â€˜realâ€™ life; if one chooses to think it so. Never was anyone more on their own; & I think she means it when she wishes the motor omnibus would swerve in her direction; but cant be bothered to step to meet it. â€œAnd then Iâ€™m so angry with myself. I have a good howl & start afresh.â€ I shouldnâ€™t like to come in from the Strand, grudging the omnibus its good guidance, find my fire out, no one there, & perhaps a business letter from a firm or an Editorâ€”something severe & impersonal. A dull man wants to marry her. Why not marry a nice man? I asked. â€œAfter being on oneâ€™s own for eight years its impossible to marry anyoneâ€ she told me. â€œOne gets into the habit of being free to do as one likes.â€ She had been the guest of Lady Rhondda in the South of France; & Lady R. who is a good able superficial woman, had psychologised her divorce proceedings all the time, which was boring Molly said; & Lady R. is a feminist, & Molly is not. But the lady Rs. ought to be feminists, I said; & you must encourage them, for if the rich women will do it, we neednt; & its the feminists who will drain off this black blood of bitterness which is poisoning us all. So we talked; the fire dying out; all in shadow, which is the best light for womenâ€™s nerves once theyâ€™re passed 40. I observe that my women guests of that ageâ€”Molly & Elena, move to have their backs to the window, on some excuse or other. Old Violet who has passed that stage, faces light composedly.

I meant to write about death, only life came breaking in as usual. I like, I see, to question people about death. I have taken it into my head that I shanâ€™t live till 70. Suppose, I said to myself the other day this pain over my heart suddenly wrung me out like a dish cloth & left me dead?â€”I was feeling sleepy, indifferent, & calm; & so thought it didnâ€™t much matter, except for L. Then, some bird or light I daresay, or waking wider, set me off wishing to live on my ownâ€”wishing chiefly to walk along the river & look at things.
