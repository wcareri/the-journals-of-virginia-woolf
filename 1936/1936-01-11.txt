This book is now becoming the oddest hop oâ€™ my thumb work: I peck & stop; peck & stop again. Think even of continuing this after tea. Its better than trying to work straight ahead. This is one of my pauses. Twelve oâ€™clockâ€”a very fine day. Asked to lecture to the Cambridge English Club. Shall I say anything of what I think of these invitations? I suppose notâ€”not yet. Ann popped in suddenly after lunch; bare legs, socks, touseled hair: wanted to borrow the second vol. of War & Peace for Judith whoâ€™s had her tonsils out. Something like a rugger blue, in a striped jersey, very tall, & vigorous. She says she has many friends in the collegesâ€”young menâ€”but we shouldnâ€™t know them. Then I read Borrowâ€™s Wild Wales, into which I can plunge head foremost; then L. went to see Morgan, found him with the usual Bugger crew: & I to tea with Nessa; & Duncan came in, & we discussed the bugger crew; which Duncan dislikes when its self conscious, as at Raymondâ€™s, & I always liken to the male urinal. Then L. cameâ€”You see I leave out the quality of the talk â€¦ it was very sympathetic. We discussed journalism, the NS: its hard bright up to date reviews; D. had been dining with Colefax to meet Max. He becomes socialâ€”is so naturally, even though he goes on the wrong day & imagines Sâ , having teaâ€”bread & butter alone. Home, & dine alone, & sleep over Mr Clarksonâ€™s memoirs. He had a sexual kink, & a passion for fishâ€”ran Sara Bernhardtâ€™s errands; & I supposeâ€”but all details are lacking, made 40,000 wigs for one show.
