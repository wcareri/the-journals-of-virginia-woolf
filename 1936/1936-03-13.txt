### Friday 13 March

Getting along rather better. So I steal 10 minutes before lunch. Never have I worked so hard at any book. My aim is not to alter a thing in proof. And I begin to suspect thereâ€™s something thereâ€”it hasnâ€™t flopped yet. But enough of The Yearsâ€”We walked round Ktn Gardens yesterday discussing politics. Aldous refuses to sign the latest manifesto because it approves sanctions. Heâ€™s a pacifist. So am I. Ought I to resign. L. says that considering Europe is now on the verge of the greatest smash for 600 years, one must sink private differences & support the League. Heâ€™s at a special L. Party meeting this morning. This is the most feverish overworked political week weâ€™ve yet had. Hitler has his army on the Rhine. Meetings taking place in London. So serious are the French that theyâ€™reâ€”the little Intelligence groupâ€”is sending a man to confer here tomorrow: a touching belief in English intellectuals. Another meeting tomorrow. As usual, I think Oh this will blow over. But its odd, how near the guns have got to our private life again. I can quite distinctly see them & hear a roar, even though I go on, like a doomed mouse, nibbling at my daily page. What else is there to doâ€”except answer the incessant telephones, & listen to what L. says. Everything goes by the board. Happily we have put off all dinners & so on, on account of The Years. A very concentrated, laborious spring this is: with perhaps 2 fine days: crocuses out; then bitter black & cold. It all seems in keeping: my drudgery; our unsociability; the crisis; meetings; darkâ€”& what it all means, no one knows. Privately â€¦ no, I doubt that Iâ€™ve seen anyone, or done anything but walk & workâ€”walk for an hour after lunchâ€”& so on. I must get back to Hâ ogarth Press MSS though.
