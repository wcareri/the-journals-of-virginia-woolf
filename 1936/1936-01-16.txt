### Thursday 16 January

Seldom have I been more completely miserable than I was about 6.30 last night, reading over the last part of The Years. Such feeble twaddleâ€”such twilight gossip it seemed; such a show up of my own decrepitude, & at such huge length. I could only plump it down on the table & rush up stairs with burning cheeks to L. He said This always happens. But I felt, no it has never been so bad as this. I make this note should I be in the same state after another book. Now this morning, dipping in, it seems to me, on the contrary, a full, bustling live book. I looked at the early pages. I think thereâ€™s something to it. But I must now force myself to begin regular sending to Mabel. 100 pages go tonight I swear.

Iris Origo to dine alone. At first I thought this too is going to be a wash out. But, chiefly owing to L.â€™s charm, & making myself a little drunk, we all chattered, more intimately than we should have done had John been there or William or Harold, & we both liked her. And she is to come again. A genuine woman, I think, honest, intelligent &, to my pleasure, well dressed: also being a snob, I like her Bird of Paradise flight through the gay world. A long green feather in her hat suggests the image.
