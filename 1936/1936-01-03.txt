### Friday 3 January

I began the year with 3 entirely submerged days, headache, head bursting, head so full, racing with ideas; & the rain pouring; the floods out; when we stumbled out yesterday the mud came over my great rubber boots; the water squelched in my soles; so this Christmas has been, as far as country is concerned, a failure, & in spite of what London can do to chafe & annoy Iâ€™m glad to go back, & have, rather guiltily, begged not to stay here another week. Today it is a yellow grey foggy day; so that I can only see the hump, a wet gleam, but no Caburn. I am content though because I think that I have recovered enough balance in the head to begin The Years, I mean the final revision on Monday. This suddenly becomes a little urgent, because for the first time for some years, L. says I have not made enough to pay my share of the house, & have to find Â£70 out of my hoard. This is now reduced to Â£700, & I must fill it up. Amusing, in its way, to think of economy again. But it would be a strain to think seriously; & worseâ€”a brutal interruptionâ€”had I to make money by journalism. The next book I think of calling Answers to Correspondentsâ€¦. But I must not at once stop & make it up. No. I must find a patient & quiet method of soothing that excitable nerve to sleep until The Years is on the tableâ€”finished; In February? Oh the reliefâ€”as if a vastâ€”what can I sayâ€”bony excrescenceâ€”bag of muscleâ€”were cut out of my brain. Yet its better to write that than the other. A queer light on my psychology. I can no longer write for papers. I must write for my own book. I mean I at once adapt what Iâ€™m going to say, if I think of a newspaper.
