### Tuesday 24 March

A very good week end. Trees coming out, hyacinths, crocuses. Hot. The first spring week end. I slept. L. had a large meeting. Clever people from Lewes. But I slept. Then we walked up to Rat Farm & looked for violets. Still spring here. Am tinkeringâ€”in a drowsy state. The approach of Easter that breaker up. Duncan going to Spain. Angelica coming back. We may do anythingâ€”perhaps go away with Morgan, whose book is out. Fat & blue. No time to read it yet. And Iâ€™m so absorbed in Two Guineasâ€”thats what Iâ€™m going to call it. I must very nearly verge on insanity I think. I get so deep in this book I dont know what Iâ€™m doing. Find myself walking along the Strand talking aloud. Old Mrs Wâ . in great spirits yesterday. Anxious to make out that Lady Oxford is not old: that a secluded life may be as good as a social one; & that parties are a natural pursuit for old women. So much of talk is always self-justification. But my five minutes is up, & I must go up. Miss Bernice Marks has been seeing Leonard.
