Armistice dayâ€”completely forgotten, by us. Iâ€™m going along quietly, rather ashamed of my extreme deliberation. Cant review Miss Weeton either. Joe will only allow me 800 words of unsigned; 1500 of signed. An amusing illustration of the virtues of capitalism. Its the advertisement, not the article, they want. And its the advertisement I dont want. But anyhow the book is bad mostly; & to compress Miss W. into 800 words would not be worth doing in the eyes of eternal truth, or any other. No. The desire to review dies out in me when I have the book. Rather an interesting experiment in its way. Again I am confirmed in my project of some private sheet.

Dined with Adrian last night: a solid man called Rickman there. A. & Kâ  very busy & friendly & both enjoying life more than they did, as I think. A. very tenuous & frail & distinguished. On the whole well in the thick of things, not so aloof as of old. A good deal of p. aâ . talked; & I liked it. A mercy not always to talk politics. L. by the way put down Bertieâ€™s book just before we went, & said â€œNow my mind is made up.â€ He had become an isolationist. I feel I was, for other reasons, these many months: but for different reasonsâ€”those I want to explore. But not here. Râ .â€™s family had always lived in Lewes & he remembered the violent Guy Fox days, when you had to wear goggles & wet straw. K. is pleased to make Â£800: a very dissatisfied woman, since she always emphasises this fact. But Iâ€™m no longer so censorious either. Have done no pages, & those the worst. Or so I hope.
