### Wednesday 4 March

Well, Iâ€™m almost through copying the raid scene, I shd. think for the 13th time. Then it will go tomorrow, & I shall have I think one days full holidayâ€”if I dareâ€”before re-reading. So Iâ€™m in sight of the end: that is in sight of the beginning of the other book which keeps knocking unmercifully at the door. Oh to be able once more to write freely every morning, spinning my own words afreshâ€”what a boonâ€”what a physical relief & rest, delight after these last monthsâ€”since October year more or lessâ€”of perpetual compressing & re-writing always at that one book.

The Dolls House last night. Lydia very good; an interesting play, wh. throws light on some of my own efforts; but I wish Iâ€™d gone to Figaro instead. Not a good audience though, & I doubt if London will be as enthusiastic as Cambridge, which is Maynardâ€™s pocket borough. Old Garnett there, like a sheep whose coat has been half torn off. No one else known to me.
