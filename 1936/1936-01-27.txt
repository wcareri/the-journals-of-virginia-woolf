### Monday 27 January

I have done something so incredibly idioticâ€”left my last chapter at Monks yesterdayâ€”that I can hardly get over it. And there I was in the rush of the end. We went to Canterbury & I listened to a full service while L. lectured in the County Hotel. But I wont write my impressions. Almost smashed coming backâ€”lights went outâ€”we backedâ€”a great car swung down, like a liner at sea, & was I thought on us. But missed. So home. Over to Nessaâ€™s: Quentin there. Duncan spent an hour blocked in his car outside Westminster. The death trudge goes on till 6 am. & I forgot to say we saw the coffin & the Princes come from Kings X: standing packed in the Square democracy, though held back by Nessa, swarmed through; leapt the chain, climbed the trees. Then they came, the coffin with its elongated yellow leopards, the crown glittering & one pale blue stone luminous, a bunch of red & white lilies: after that 3 undertakers in black coats with astrachan collars: â€œour Kingâ€ as the woman next me called him, who looks blotched & as if chipped by a stone mason: only his rather set wistful despair marked him from any shopkeeperâ€”not an ingratiating face: bloated, roughened, as if by exposure to drink life grief & as red as a fisherboys. Then it was over. & I shall not try to see more. But the whole world will be afoot at dawn tomorrow.
