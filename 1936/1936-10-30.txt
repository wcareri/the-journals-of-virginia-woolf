### Friday 30 October

I do not wish for the moment to write out the story of the months since I made the last mark here. I do not wish, for reasons I cannot now develop, to analyse that extraordinary summer. It will be more helpful & healthy for me to write scenes; to take up my pen & describe actual events: good practice too for my stumbling & doubting pen. Can I still â€˜writeâ€™? That is the question, you see. And now I will try to prove if the gift is dead, or dormant.

Tuesday 27th. On Tuesday I went to tea with Sibyl. It was a very windy wet evening; leaves swirling along the pavement, people holding their hats & skirts. An oldish shabby man in seedy day clothes opened the door. He might have been a bailiff but was I suppose an auctioneerâ€™s assistant. â€œLady Colefax?â€ I said. He shook his head. He thought I had come to see the furniture. Come this way, he said, & led me, or rather disappeared in front of me, into the servants quartersâ€”that unknown region where so many meals have been prepared, when Fielding issued, so discreet, respectable & cordial. Now there were tables set out with dinner services, with bunches of knives & forks, all ticketed & labelled. Fielding came out from the hidden premises, still in her grey dress & apron, but looking blurred & flustered. â€œI dont know where to put youâ€ she said, in an agitated way, & murmuring something about finding her ladyship, about people being still here, led me finally with apologies to the dining room. That brown festive & somehow succulent room was also up for sale. The walnut table had its ticket & the little glass trees on the mantelpiece & the chandelier. It is a nice warm room I thought sitting down on one of the brown chairs, & thinking how very shy I had been there; yet how glad after, that I had overcome the terror of hair & clothes, & how nimble my tongue became, & how little alarming it was to talk to Sir Arthur on my right, or George Moore or Noel Coward on my left. Yes, I had enjoyed myself in a mixed way thereâ€”the feeling was compounded of relief to find so little to frighten & of pleasure to find so much to sayâ€”when in peered, in the tentative calculating way of a stranger looking at things he may want to buy, an obviously alien gentleman: the sort of man in a brown overcoat that one sees at sales, but not at parties at Argyll House. And no sooner had he begun sizing up the furniture than two fashionable, dimly recognisable women, peered in; one of whom, the smaller, the vaguely pretty & familiar, recognised me to the extent of smiling & half extending her hand; but clearly my name escaped her. And hers only tentatively seemed to me to be Ava Wigram. How sadâ€”how very sadâ€”she said (words I had used to the tremulous & flustered Fielding who seemed, as she agreed, about to burst into tears). â€˜Yes its sad, very sad..â€™ I echoed. And then she asked, had I come to see the things? for I was sitting in my chair as if waiting. No, Iâ€™ve come to see Sibyl I said .. & they prowled round: Ava I think surprised, perhaps displeased, at this assumption of superior intimacy. They were tentatively wandering, touching this & that, into the next room, when Sibyl herself peered in: hurried, furtive; summoned me, as if she lifted me, secretly, to some private assignation out of a world now all formal, no longer friendly. And so we crossed into the drawing room, where, with a sigh & some explanations, she shut the door & sank on the sofa.

My bare hand rested for a moment on her bare hand. This is sympathy, I felt: but it must not be emphasised or prolonged. She looked like a dried up bird; marks were cut on either side of her nose. Deep clefts ran under her eyes. But of course she talked facts. Who was that, in the dining room? Ava Wigram. Oh dearâ€”she saw me then? No I think not.

But Sibyl, you must rest?  
My dear, how can I rest? The Dr & surgeon said to me You must now take 6 months holiday. But Iâ€™m not Greta Garbo â€¦ Whereâ€™s tea?  
Tea, bread & butter & gingerbread, was brought.  
No, everyone says Fielding is a help. I can tell you the truth. Iâ€™ve lived for 35 years with the Irish. She laughs. Then she cries.  
But Sibyl, I said, trying to formulate some phrase of affection or regret, you have given â€¦ yes, passing this house, Iâ€™ve often thought thatâ€”seeing the lights.  
Oh, in those days I was a millionaire. What could I do but give?  
Then compliments to me, which I disdained. Youâ€™ve given to living people .. Iâ€™ve seen Arnold Bennett, George Moore, Noel Cowardâ€¦.  
Door opens â€¦  
Lady Mary Cholmondeley my lady.  
Who? I dont know any such person.. Excuse me, I must go & see for myself â€¦  
  

And she wont wear spectacles, because of her appearance. I say I dont mind wearing them all day .. (but she doesnt). What were we saying? Yes, those youâ€™ve named, they were the people I like to think of â€¦ Glad youâ€™ve had some teaâ€”this is wretched. No, I cant talk to anyone. I go on. I cant let myself talk, or I should sink into such depths â€¦ I should never recover. There are my old Aunts, the Wedgwoods. They knew us when we were youngâ€”when we were engaged. Yes. I go on, from thing to thing.

In comes Ava & the other woman. Society small talk. We shall see you againâ€¦.  
My dear that woman. I dislike her.  
I too, because she makes me dislike her: I dont like disliking people.

Thats true. Stories of Avaâ€™s meanness about the Lyttons & the house in North Street. A story about the house in North Street, how she got it for 700 less. And when I woke from the anaesthetic, Michael said to me the house is gone. I said Well, its not our year, thats all about it. Its not our year. After that I got the house for 700 less than I offeredâ€”because of the Lyttons, & its been lived in by a madman, its filthy. No, Iâ€™ve always wanted to be able to say if theres anyone you want to meet, Iâ€™ll arrange it. I wanted to bring people together â€¦ Now Iâ€™m going to do two things. To collect an anthology of love poems. Isnt it odd? When I was a girl of 18 I read a poem & thought I understood it all. At 18â€”knowing nothing of life. Iâ€™m going to collect an anthology for lovers. And in the nursing home I went through lettersâ€”little notes from Aâ . Bâ . from Wâ . Raleigh.

To turn from dialogue to narrative.

She talked in a scattered nervous way, like a hen fluttering over the edge of an abyss. A brave hen. Her eyes were bright. And they say now that she has cancer in her breast. Nor could I always distinguish between the poseâ€”I am going to show myself poetic & unworldly to Virginiaâ€”& the genuine gallantry. She has been too long exposed to artificial light to do without it. She is like a bat in a bright room when she is in darkness. She is blinded by darkness; I mean when she is alone, without the stimulus & direction of other peoples views she is uncertain. Flounders. With us it is just the opposite. But whether I imagined it or not, I still felt something genuinely rising from the depths in her: a desire to fight her adversity, a momentary desire to break down; but then she was up again & off again. When the door opened & Fielding croaked out â€œThe car, mâ€™ladyâ€ she was glad of the call to action & we swept through the wind swept fluttering lighted streets, sitting together in the Rolls Royce while she told stories, adequately indeed rather brilliantly, of George Moore & Wells, of Henry James & Carrie Balestier. The machine had got going again, after its momentary paralysis, & she jumped out at Mount Street to pay a business visit. Then she was going to a concert & then to have a supper party

But in this hasty account I have forgotten to describe my farewell to Argyll House, as I walked with her out of the double doors, down the little path, & stood for a moment at the wrought iron gate.
