### Wednesday 25 November

L.â€™s birthday. Lunch with Clive. The Princess, a waxy solid handsome lady with kind eyes. Not formidable. Ros. Eddy Ld Berners. Talk all very brilliant. The usual sense of having done with that when it was half over. And the different changes of light. The intimacy. Then the superficiality. Very cold. An eyeless grey day. The same subjects recur. Sybil. Ld. Bâ€™s jokes, the same. Ros. muffled & tentative. I, rather too erratic. The Pâ . out of things. And I must lunch with her & Ethel tomorrow.
