### Wednesday 22 January

The people of America are mourning, as if for their own King; & the Japanese are in tears. So it goes on. But as a matter of fact the Prime Ministerâ€”we are only allowed official announcements on the BBCâ€”& if you turn it on you only hear the ticking of a vast clockâ€”was rather fitting; almost sincere, & very well conditioned. He gave out the impression that he was a tired country gentleman; the King another; both enjoyed Christmas at home; & the Queen is very lonely; one left the other taken, as must happen to married couples; & the King had seemed to him tired lately, but very kind, & quiet as if ready for a long journey; & had woken once or twice, on the last day & had said something Kind (â€˜Kindâ€™ was the adjective always) & had said to his Secretary â€œHow is the Empire?â€â€”an odd expression. â€œThe Empire, Sir, is wellâ€; whereupon he fell asleep. And then of course, he ended with God Save the King.

The shops are all black. â€œWe always carry a large stockâ€ the woman at Lewisâ€™s said. But thereâ€™ll be nothing doing after this rush at all. Thereâ€™ll be no work for usâ€¦â€ Mourning is to outlast the London Season. A black Ascot.
