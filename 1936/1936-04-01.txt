### Wednesday 1 April

I forgot though to make L. an April fool, & he forgot too. The Ms. are lavender & silver. We went to tea with Gerald yesterday, which was like visiting an alligator in a tank, an obese & obsolete alligator, lying like our tortoises, half in & half out of the water. I wished I had gone to Downing St. to hear Baldwin on Newnham as I sat there in the very ugly de Vere Gardens room, with the dull covers, & the tea on wheeled waiters, & the old picture that Gerald bought 40 years ago at St. Ives over the fire. I doubt that he much enjoyed seeing us, or has any capacity for enjoying anything left. We talked publishersâ€™ shop, & sheâ€”her name I dont knowâ€”was vivacious in the strained way of a woman whose life is empty & who has perpetually to animate her husband. She is â€˜got upâ€™ but elderly; shrivelled; rather a nice woman, I suspect, but discontented. And G. told me about his diseases, & threw cold water, sensible, business manâ€™s very faded common senseâ€”for he has failed as a business manâ€”on all projects. Theres nothing in itâ€”nothing in it, he kept saying. Also, nothing doing; nothing doing whatever. I think felt us perhaps more in the swim than himself. I doubt he has any sentiment about the past either: may like Georgeâ€™s sonsâ€”I donâ€™t know. And keeps up with Sophie & Emma Vaughan. So we went & walked in the park. If I can do 25 pages daily I shall be done by Tuesday next. And then the proofs. How its to come out in May, God knows. But I no longer bother much: am doing the difficult North & Sara; but philosophically.
