### Sunday 29 March

Now its Sunday, & Iâ€™m still forging ahead. Done Eleanor in Oxford Street for the 20th time this morning. Iâ€™ve plotted it out now, & shall have done by Tuesday 7th April, I tell myself. And I cant help thinking its rather good. But no more of that. One bad head this week, lying prostrate. So I missed Nessaâ€™s potters party, at which Angelica made a sensation in a new hat. And we put off going to the Cecils this week end: but went instead to Richmond yesterday; saw the lovely view, with a piece of deep green grass, the gasometer, & the clouds: looking towards Ealing L. said. So home; then to the Master Builder, where I did not like Lydiaâ€™s version; partly the ugly clothes; high boots, green skirt, red shawl. And she hasnt the compass; cant swing from the real to the poetic. Elizabeth Cameron was there with a cousin, who agreed. In fact they were very emphatic. Hated it. Asked us to meet the Master builder & drink beer at the CafÃ© Royal; but we refused, & came home; saw the Polish Prince coming, & only locked ourselves in just in time. L. has a sore throat this morning. We think of going, & high time too, to Monks House next Friday & digging ourselves in. Nessa & Angelica, Clive & Quentin will all be there.

I have left out Elizabeth Robins by the wayâ€”a great curse to me; for she came at a moment of high pressure; & I had to throw myself into her infinitely intense, exacting, pernickety demands. No, she must explainâ€”in fact had come from Brighton to explain. She cannot go to see the M.B. but she does go to playsâ€”thats what I cant denyâ€”with a friend. But my sight is goingâ€”now this is a secret. I dont mean Iâ€™m going blind. But I must spare my eyes. And I have a book to write. I want to keep all my strength for that. Could you explain do you think? Yes. yes. and then thereâ€™s another thing, I could only tell you in confidence. I couldnt go & see her Hilda. Iâ€™m Hilda. Iâ€™m the person it was written for â€¦ All very intense. A small frozen humming birdâ€”with rouged lips: intense blue eyes, very small, old; full of accents & intensities. We are to go to dinner or tea.
