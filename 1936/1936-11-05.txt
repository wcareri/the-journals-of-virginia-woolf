### Thursday 5 November

The miracle is accomplished. L. put down the last sheet about 12 last night; & could not speak. He was in tears. He says it is â€œa most remarkable bookâ€”he likes it better than The Waves.â€ & has not a spark of doubt that it must be published. I, as a witness, not only to his emotion, but to his absorption, for he read on & on, canâ€™t doubt his opinion: what about my own? Anyhow the moment of relief was divine. I hardly know yet if Iâ€™m on my heels or headâ€”so amazing is the reversal since Tuesday morning. I have never had such an experience before. Now it is pouring & we go down to Lewes for the fireworks. Eth Watson & Ka yesterday & to the Book Show & walk along Vâ  Street & so on.
