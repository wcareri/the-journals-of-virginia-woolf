### Tuesday 10 November

On the whole it has gone better this morning. Its true my brain is so tired of this job it aches after an hour or less. So I must dandle it, & gently immerse it. Yes I think its good; in its very difficult way.

Yesterday Barnes came to tea; a very white & black professional young man. Strained: on a leash: much burdened with his job; & the moral strain of keeping the BBC up to Cambridge standards. A nice old fashioned Cambridge young man.

Before that I met L. at the Red Lion & down came Kingsley looking, I thought pale lead coloured, ravaged, unwholesome. My pity of course came to the surface; & of course he asked me to review Chestertonâ€™s Auâ tobiographâ y wh. he held in his hand. No doubt I could make a living that way if I chose. In fact the old fountains only want this paving stone of a book off them to spring up. I wonder if anyone has ever suffered so much from a book, as I have from The Years. Once out I will never look at it again. Its like a long childbirth. Think of that summer, every morning a headache, & forcing myself into that room in my nightgown; & lying down after a page: & always with the certainty of failure. Now that certainty is mercifully removed to some extent. But now I feel I dont care what anyone says so long as Iâ€™m rid of it. And for some reason I feel Iâ€™m respected & liked. But this is only the haze dance of illusion, always changing. Never write a long book again. Yet I feel I shall write more fictionâ€”scenes will form. But I am tired this morning: too much strain & racing yesterday. The Daily Worker article. Madrid not fallen. Chaos. Slaughter. War surrounding our island. Mauron over, & G. Brennan. Dine with Adrian tonight.
