### Friday 27 November

Lunch, again with the Princess, at Claridges, where in all my 54 years I have never been. Like a private houseâ€”sumptuous yet refined. The Frenchâ€”little Polignac nieceâ€”a singer: Nadia Boulanger, the Conductorâ€”wear black. Sir R. Storrs. Like George: stolid, second rate, a snob, & very vain. Also disapproving. The genial man gone cold, like red beef congealed. And what a lot to eat! Half left on our plates. Ethel talking with admirable racy English. The smart white faced lady in pearls listening. How she went to prison. The Ps not very vital. Boulanger the one I likedâ€”a vital shabby governess type. French, very, so erect & smart, not dowdy, only shabby: one cheap brooch in the right place. Little P. devitalised, pretty, said F. women must have men. Bâ oulanger says they rule France through influence. Its true they cant get passports officially: but unofficially get everything run everything. Storrs masculine. Only has wine at night. Reads seasonally: Dante: Homer: Shakespeare. Is writing his memoirsâ€”a conceited manâ€”a non-entity I think, but wants to come here. Why? P. tactfully puts a shade over Ethel. Ethel the only one with brains (except B.) (I think I must read Dante of a morning.) So not a very exciting or formidable affair. I walked home; in my black velvet; not a bad day. Happy to be so unconcerned. Then he was told to wait.

L. has a confidential story about the King & Mrs Simpson, told him in secret by K. Martin. Dined alone, read Sir T. Browneâ€™s letters. I am getting back to solid food again. My wits fritter easily, but not so easily. I must work, as I told Sally G. who suffers I think considerably & shd. break off her engagement instead of being psychoanalysed. Ott. after teaâ€”& am I to tell her about Stephen Tennant & Lyttonâ€™s letters? She will erect herself & puff out her cobra hood if I do.
