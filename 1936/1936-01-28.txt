### Tuesday 28 January

The King is at this moment being buried, & if I go up I shall hear the service. A fine mild morning. The sun is out, the streets almost empty. An occasional hoot. No registered post this morning. And a tea party this afternoon.

The most extraordinary thing about writing is that when youâ€™ve struck the right vein, tiredness goes. It must be an effort, thinking wrong, at 5 to one, after a sterile bitter morning, the vein flows: I think now I see to the end.
