### Tuesday 23 June

A good dayâ€”a bad dayâ€”so it goes on. Few people can be so tortured by writing as I am. Only Flaubert I think. Yet I see it now, as a whole: I think I can bring it off, if I only have courage & patience: take each scene quietly: compose: I think it may be a good book. And thenâ€”oh when its finished!

Not so clear today, because I went to dentist & then shopped. My brain is like a scale: one grain pulls it down. Yesterday it balanced: today dips.
