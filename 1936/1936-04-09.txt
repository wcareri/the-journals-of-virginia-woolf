### Thursday 9 April

Now will come the season of depression, after congestion suffocation. The last batch was posted to Clark at Brighton yesterday. L. is in process of reading. I daresay Iâ€™m pessimistic, but I fancy a certain tepidity in his verdict so far: but then its provisional. At any rate these are disgusting, racking at the same time enervated days, & must be thrown on the bonfire. The horror is that tomorrow, after this one windy day of respiteâ€”oh the cold North wind that has blown ravaging daily since we came, but Iâ€™ve had no ears, eyes, or nose: only making my quick transits from house to room, often in despairâ€”after this one dayâ€™s respite, I say, I must begin at the beginning & go through 600 pages of cold proof. Why oh why? Never again, never again. No sooner have I written that, than I make up the first pages of Two Guineas, & begin a congenial ramble about Roger. But seriously I think this shall be my last â€˜novelâ€™. But then I want to tackle criticism too. Enough, though. The first task is to resume charge of life: to read Hogarth MSS. & to stir the waters. Iâ€™ve let them get a little stagnant, mildewed.

Dining at Charleston tonight, Iâ€™m glad to say. Cliveâ€™s article on the Q.M. to be discussed. We met Nessa & Angelica in Lewes: & A. looked like the heroine in a Turgenev novel, in her frogged dress & little cap. Judith Bagenal already a woman of 45 with 6 children: husband a clergyman, I think, or Lecturer at the London School of Economics.

I dont think I said we had taken Morgan to Abingerâ€”a very very bitter cold day: his love, the stout policeman to see him off at Manchester Street. A silent drive, through suburbs, with raked roads: no view: all misted; then sharp to the right & left; up a lane, & there on a little hill was his house; & old Mrs F. columnar with the prominent grey eyes, the maid in apron & false teeth, the handy man & gardener in the distance, all there to welcome him. He has some nicknameâ€”â€œTong?â€â€”for his mother. And we had a look in at the scrupulous Victorian drawing room, with the silver kettle, & the Richmond drawings; one of Hannah More & Squirrelâ€”& then left.

And then there was Colefaxâ€”yes, instantly on us, the first day we arrived, for lunch: in a black beret, & grey tweed coat; dried, like one of the hams in Flintâ€™s shop: not improved by sorrow I think, only posed. Poor woman, what a hard nature; so that to lose Arthur only liberates a little misty sentiment. And yet sheâ€™s brave, I think: but still the hostess, the aspiring, restless, dissatisfiedâ€”running, running, like a dog behind a carriage, that always goes too fast. And how she snaps at the other running dogsâ€”Mrs Wigram, Madame de Margerie. We had polite conversation about notables over the fire, & then she left. Rolls Royce: going on to customers, I think.
