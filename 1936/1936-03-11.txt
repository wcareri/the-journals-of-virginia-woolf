### Wednesday 11 March

Well yesterday I sent off 132 pages to Clark. We have decided to take this unusual courseâ€”that is to print it in galleys before L. sees it & send it to America. Iâ€™m thus feeling more at ease; but rather slack, as we went to Hedda Gabler last night with Nessa Duncan & Mrs Grant. I did not get the full impact: my mind too much set, I suppose, on my own corrections. Jean F. Robertson however was sinuous seductive sinister in a curious metallic old dress. Blue. A girl, who might have been an Ibsen lady, smiled at me. Now who is she? We cant place her. I am only writing this to mark time till lunch. Still, considering my languor, I think Ibsen comes pretty well out of it. (oh the rhythms that go on in my head. Thats one of the difficulties: I must break: want a usual [?] tone: must read Swift, I think). News is that we are going to stay one week end with David & Rachel: Morgan is again going on well. Nessa had trays of pure Chinese silk from Julian. Sheâ€™s taking a room for Angelica. Iâ€™m pleased by the way that A. Bennett writing to his nephew seems, I think, to acquit me of authorsâ€™ vanity. â€œWe got on fine, the day after Iâ€™d slanged her publicly in the E.S.â€¦. We had a great pow-wow at Ethel Sands. Virginiaâ€™s all right..â€ This might be my epitaph I think.

I cant help feeling in the subcutaneous way one does feel such things that we are slightly on the up grade again: old Bloomsbury. Its rather a nicer feeling than being on the down grade perhaps. Nevinson, the painter, gave 50 centimes to the Fund to buy a CÃ©zanne, in Rogerâ€™s memory. Now that sort of meanness makes me angry. Its all of a piece with Grigson &c. And heres Hampson coolly applying to L. who is rushed & pumped & milked by every ninny on the European situationâ€”for help about his miserable little contracts. The European situation developed on Saturday. We were at Monks House. Hâ itler has broken his word again, proposes to re-enter the League. But Iâ€™m too languid: shall even consider having an afternoon off.
