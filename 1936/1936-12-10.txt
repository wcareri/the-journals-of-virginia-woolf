### Thursday 10 December

The chops & changes of the Crisis wd. be worth investigating, had I time. It is a foggy cold morning, as damp & dismal as can be. I have just turned on my electric light. Has the King abdicated? I think so. At 3.30. Baldwin will speak. Each day has been differentâ€”judâ gâ ing from the papers & shop sampling. The Times reiterates No one has hurried the King. We sympathise but â€¦ it is for his Majesty to decide. The Rothermere press & Churchill, who was shouted down in the House, have subsided. No more talk of coercing the King. Mrs Simpson at Cannes says she is ready to withdraw from an unhappy & untenable position. Cars, black cars, drive constantly to & from Fort Belvedere where the King is immured, some (Labour Party gossips) say drinking: the papers say consulting a vet, about a dog who has hurt her paw. Baldwin goes down constantly: the King is rude & drunk. Last night the Queen & Pss Mary went. A brake laden with luggage was seen to leave the fort. No royal engagements are kept. It is a time of mourning. The Q. visits old curiosity shops & is said to have bought a gold frog. Meanwhile â€˜the peopleâ€™ have swung round to a kind of sneering contempt. â€œOught to be ashamed of himselfâ€ the tobacconists young woman said. Timmy the Qâ€™s sec: told George Bergen that abdication is settled. Maynard says no: the difficulties, legal &c, are too great. Bergen says Timmy says he is now merely haggling for a sufficient income. K. George left him nothing; & he has lavished money & jewels on Simpson. All the royal dukes are in & out & the Chancellors & solicitors with their black boxes. Last night Mary on the telephone said that to her certain (through Lady Diana & Lord Brownlow) knowledge the King some weeks ago, finding Mrs S. cooling, became mad with rage; also was entirely possessed against all friends advice, of some bourgeois (her word) obsession about marriage: insisted, after 2 years of license, that the marriage service was essentialâ€”though Mrs S. did not wish itâ€”& went to Baldwin. Baldwin, Mary says, then learnt of the situation for the first time. The rest followed. She says all his friends think him insane. He could have gone on with Mrs S. as mistress till they both cooled: no one objected. Now he has probably lost her, & thrown away the Kingdom & made us all feel slightly yet perceptibly humiliated. Its odd, but so I even feel it. Walking through Whitehall the other day, I thought what a Kingdom! England! And to put it down the sink â€¦ Not a very rational feeling. Still it is what the Nation feels. The Times is discreetly sarcastic at his expense: has a curl of disdain in its tone; quotes, in its leader this morning, letters which beginning earlier in the week with hysterical sympathy, now say Our sons & brothers gave their wives & lovers & also their lives for the country. And cant the King do even thisâ€”? But everything now hardens into the certainty that the King cant do this, & will follow his luggage to Cannes. Rather an ignominious flightâ€”I feel again. He will live in America, Bergen says, Timmy says: & the Q. wants him to abdicate. I gather that Lady Diana, en route for Belvedere, called on Jack in his nursing home, to ask his advice. He advised that the King should professedly give her up: abstain from her society for one year; & then revert to her. But apparently the Kingâ€™s little bourgeois demented mind sticks fast to the marriage service. Mrs S. gives him, unlike all the other mistresses, physical relief: her time synchronises with him. And it is said that she is now a little cooling; so what will they do in Kentucky? I am reluctant to end this page, because it is I think the last entry I shall make in this book on the subject of Edward the Eighth. If I write tomorrow, it will be in the reign, I suppose of Albert the Firstâ€”& heâ€™s not, so Mary says, a popular choice. Let it be. This afternoon I shall go down in the fog to the hub of the universe, & hang about the H. of C.

This is the first hour, or since it is 5.30, & the abdication was announced at 4, the first hour & a half, of the new reign. Yes, I thought, its silly buying sachets at Stags & Mantles: I will go to Westminster. A bus took me to the top of Whitehall. There traffic was turned off & I dismounted. Whitehall was full of shuffling & trampling. People going both ways. Not a thick crowdâ€”a moving crowd. A very beautiful yellow brown light: dry pavements: still lamps lit. Lines of light at Parliament Sqre. & the houses of Parliament in silhouette. The lamp burning in the watch tower. Opposite the Horse Guards there was Ottoline, black, white, red lipped coming towards me. She intercepted my impulse to escape. We turned & walked on. Then Bob Trevelyan loomed up. We three stood & talked. They said it was dreadful â€¦ Iâ€™m very sad â€¦ Its a pity. Has he abdicated? I asked. No, but they say he will. No one knew if he had or hadnâ€™t. A stir of uneasy feeling .. most people half sad, yet also ashamed, yet also excited. Bob left us, not before thoâ€™ heâ€™s hummed & hawed & said that Hawtrey didnt think so badly of the D. of York. Then on we wandered down the yellow brown avenue. We looked up at the beautiful carved front ofâ€”what office? I dont know. Thats the window out of which Charles the First stepped when he had his head cut off said Ottoline, pointing to the great lit up windows in their frame of white stone. So my mother always told me. I felt I was walking in the 17th Century with one of the courtiers; & she was lamenting not the abdication of Edwardâ€”still though people shuffled this way & thatâ€”but the execution of Charles. Its dreadful, dreadful, she kept saying. Of course Portlandâ€™s glad he should go. Poor silly little boyâ€”He always lost his temper. No one could ever tell him a thing he disliked. But to throw it awayâ€¦. Still he hadnâ€™t yet, so far as we knew, thrown it away. â€˜Itâ€™ seemed then, looking at the curved street, & at the red & silver guards drawn up in the court-yard with the Park & the white government buildings behind, very stately, very lovely, very much the noble & severe aristocratic Stuart England .. However, nothing seemed to happen. And she had a tea party: so we hailed a taxi. Have you any news? the man said. No. I dont know .. What do you think? I say he should. We dont want a woman thats already had 2 husbands & an American when there are so many good English girls .. We were thus driving & talking when a newspaper car drove by with the word Abdication very large on a placard. It stopped near us; & the first papers in the bale were bought by Ottoline & me.

This is the first moment of the new reign, I said to Milly, at the open door of number 10: but she was agitated because some unexpected visitorâ€”a man in a coatâ€”had comeâ€”
