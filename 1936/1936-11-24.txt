### Tuesday 24 November

Here I am cleft as usual in my little stick. So free & so cabined. The future. What Iâ€™m to write. Yes I think I can write &c. Began 3 Gs. yesterday. & liked it. Today the old symptomsâ€”t. of l., cant get rid of itâ€”the swollen veinsâ€”the tingling; the odd falling; feeling of despair. Brain not fully blooded. Hot & cold. Iâ€™m glad, how odd, that Iâ€™m lunching with Clive to meet Mme de Polignac. That Iâ€™ve a new black felt hat, bought yesterday after having Ethel S. to lunch. Glad too that Helen Anrep is dining with me: that I shant be alone, alone I fall into those trances, comas, which are I suppose t. of l: but so frustrating, when I want to be clear & to read. A curious throbbing this disease produces. But Iâ€™ve been on the whole vigorous & cheerful since the wonderful revelation of L.â€™s that night. How I woke from deathâ€”or non beingâ€”to life! What an incredible nightâ€”what a weight rolled off!

Yeatsâ€™ anthology out. Am I jealous? No: but depressed to feel Iâ€™m not a poet. Next time I shall be one. And Iâ€™ve touched ground. Whatever happens I dont think I can now be destroyed. Only work work is essential. Rogerâ€¦. &c.

Very cold & dank. We came up on Sunday through the fog. Figures suddenly emerged. The kind man with a paper. I walked by his side leading the car. It crashed into a wall. The wing buckled. Walked by the kerb all through Wimbledon & Wandsworth. The kerb ended. Here I was lost in a trackless mist. & so on & on. A little boy emergedâ€”a street ruffian. People lined the pavement watching the lost cars. Another man led us; offered me a rest. In the car I looked & found the paper was The Blackshirt. Out again. Just as we thought we must find a garage & come home by tube a bus driver told us that in 200 yards it would be clear. So, miraculously, it was. Glass clearâ€”lit up, & so home.

I have also written my memoir. Indeed The Years has taught me something about scenes. But are they worth doing? I want a spell of private writingâ€”with Nessa perhaps. Dotty much praised. My hackles riseâ€”that she shd. lend herself to puffing, shd. print her photograph. Old E. says this is a detail. I daresay sheâ€™s rightâ€”with all her faults she has scope, proportion. She touched me by giving me her little notebook of the woman in the train, well bound, with an inscription. When Iâ€™m low, how this touches me. But I will not be low. Up & off again, like the gull in the poem. Meredithâ€™s. I wish I cd. invent a way of dashing down criticism, as I do here.
