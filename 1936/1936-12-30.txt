### Thursday 30 December

There in front of me lie the proofsâ€”the galleysâ€”to go off today .. a sort of stinging nettle that I cover over. Nor do I wish even to write about it here.

A divine relief has possessed me these last daysâ€”at being quit of itâ€”good or bad. And, for the first time since February I shd. say my mind has sprung up like a tree shaking off a load. And Iâ€™ve plunged into Gibbon & read & read, for the first time since Feb. I think. Now for action & pleasure again & going about. I cd. make some interesting perhaps valuable notes, on the absolute necessity for me of work. Always to be after something. Iâ€™m not sure that the intensiveness & exclusiveness of writing a long book is a possible state: I mean, if even in future I do such a thingâ€”& I doubt itâ€”I will force myself to vary it with little articles. Anyhow, now I am not going to think can I write? I am going to sink into unselfconsciousness & work: at Gibbon first: then a few little articles for America; then {{Roger/3 Guineas}} Which of the 2 comes first, how to dovetail, I dont know. Anyhow even if The Years is a failure, Iâ€™ve thought considerably; & collected a little hoard of ideas. Perhaps Iâ€™m now again on one of those peaks where I shall write 2 or 3 little books quickly: & then have another break. At least I feel myself possessed of skill enough to go on with. No emptiness.

& in proof of this will go in, get my Gibbon notes & begin a careful sketch of the article.
