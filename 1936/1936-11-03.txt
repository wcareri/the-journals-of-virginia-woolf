Miracles will never ceaseâ€”L. actually likes The Years! He thinks it so farâ€”as far as the wind chapterâ€”as good as any of my books. I will put down the actual facts. On Sunday I started to read the proofs. When I had read to the end of the first section I was in despair: stony but convinced despair. I made myself yesterday read on to Present Time. When I reached that landmark I said This is happily so bad that there can be no question about it. I must carry the proofs, like a dead cat, to L. & tell him to burn them unread. This I did. And a weight fell off my shoulders. That is true. I felt relieved of some great pack. It was cold & dry & very grey & I went out & walked through the graveyard with Cromwellâ€™s daughters Tomb down through Grays Inn along Holborn & so back. Now I was no longer Virginia, the genius, but only a perfectly insignificant yet contentâ€”shall I call it spirit? a body? And very tired. Very old. But at the same time content to go on these 100 years with Leonard. So we lunched, in a constraint: a grey acceptance; & I said to L. I will write to Richmond & ask for books to review. The proofs will cost I suppose between 2 & 300 pounds which I will pay out of my hoard. As I have 700 this will leave 400. I was not unhappy. And L. said he thought I might be wrong about the book. Then ever so many strange men arrived: Mr Mumford, mahogany coloured lean, with a very hard bowler & a cane; whom I put in the drawing room with a cigarette; Mr â€”â€” very heavy & large, who said Pardon me & knocked at the door. And Lord & Lady Cecil rang up to ask us to lunch to meet the Spanish Ambassador. (I am making up 3 Guineas) Then, after tea, we went to the Sunday Times book show. How stuffy it was! How dead I feltâ€”Oh how infinitely tired! And Miss White came up, a hard little woman, with a cheery wooden face, & talked about her book & reviews. And then Ursula Strachey came across from Duckworths & said you dont know who I am? And I remembered the moonlit river. And then Roger Senhouse tapped me on the shoulder. We went home, & L. read & read & said nothing: I began to feel actively depressed; yet could make up The Years differentlyâ€”Iâ€™ve thought of a scheme for another bookâ€”it should be told in the first person.â€”Would that do as a form for Roger?â€”& I fell into one of my horrid heats & deep slumbers, as if the blood in my head were cut off. Suddenly L. put down his proof & said he thought it extraordinarily goodâ€”as good as any of them. And now he is reading on, & tired out with the exertion of writing these pages Iâ€™m going up to read the Italian book.
