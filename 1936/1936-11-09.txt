### Monday 9 November

I must make some resolutions about this book. I find it extremely difficult. I get into despair. It seems so bad. I can only cling to L.â€™s verdict. Then I get distracted: I tried, as an anodyne, to take up an article; a memoir: to review a book for the Listener. They make my mind race. I must fix it upon The Years. I must do my proofs & send them off. I must fix my mind on it all the morning. I think the only way is to do that, & then let myself do something else between tea & dinner. But immerse in The Years all the morningâ€”nothing else. If the chapter is difficult, concentrate for a short time. Then write here. But dont dash off into other writing till after tea. When it is done, we can always ask Morgan.
