### Wednesday 4 November

L. who has now read to the end of 1914 still thinks it extraordinarily good: very strange; very interesting; very sad. We discussed my sadness .. But my difficulty is this: I cannot bring myself to believe that he is right. It may be simply that I exaggerated its badness, & therefore he now, finding it not so bad, exaggerates its goodness, if it is to be published, I must at once sit down & correct: how can I? Every other sentence seemed to me bad. But I am shelving the question till he has done, which should be tonight. Now I must copy out my Daily Worker article; then E. Watson is coming: then Ka to lunch. It is one of the most puzzling situations I have ever been in. Of course we might appeal to Morgan.
