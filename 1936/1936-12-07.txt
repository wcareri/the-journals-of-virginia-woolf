### Monday 7 December

Now, we areâ€”without a King? With a Queen? What? The Simpson affair is on the surface. It was on Wednesday 2nd Dec that the Bishop commented on the Kings lack of religion. On Thursday all the papers, The Times & Dâ aily Tâ elegraph very discreetly, mentioned some, domestic difficulties; others Mrs Simpson. All London was gay & garrulousâ€”not exactly gay, but excited. We cant have a woman Simpson for Queen, that was the sense of it. Sheâ€™s no more royal than you or me, was what the grocerâ€™s young woman said. But today, before the PM. makes his announcement to the House, we have developed a strong sense of human sympathy; we are saying Hang it allâ€”the age of Victoria is over. Let him marry whom he likes. In the Beefsteak Club however only Lord Onslow & Clive take the democratic view. Harold is glum as an undertaker, & so are the other nobs. They say Royalty is in Peril. The Empire is divided. In fact never has there been such a crisis. That I think is true. Spain, Germany, Russiaâ€”all are elbowed out. The marriage stretches from one end of the paper to another. Pictures of the D. of York & the Princesses fill every cranny. Mrs Simpson is snapped by lime light at midnight as she gets out of her car. Her luggage is also photographed. Parties are forming. The different interests are queueing up behind Baldwin, or Churchill. Mosley is taking advantage of the crisis for his ends. In fact we are all talking 19 to the dozen; & it looks as if this one little insignificant man had moved a pebble wh. dislodges an avalanche. Thingsâ€”empires, hierarchiesâ€”moralitiesâ€”will never be the same again. Yet today there is a certain feeling that the button has been pressed too hard: emotion is no longer so liberally forthcoming. And the King may keep us all waiting, while he sits, like a naughty boy in the nursery, trying to make up his mind.

Coming past the Palace last night there were crowds waiting in the coldâ€”it is very coldâ€”cant writeâ€”with eyes fixed on the windows. Two or 3 lights were burning in upper windows.
