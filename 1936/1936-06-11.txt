### Thursday 11 June

I can only, after 2 months, make this brief note, to say at last after 2 months dismal & worse, almost catastrophic illnessâ€”never been so near the precipice to my own feeling since 1913â€”Iâ€™m again on top. I have to re-write, I mean interpolate & rub out most of The Years in proof. But I cant go into that. Can only do an hour or so. Oh but the divine joy of being mistress of my mind again! Back from MH. yesterday. Now I am going to live like a cat stepping on eggs till my 600 pages are done. I think I canâ€”I think I canâ€”but must have immense courage & buoyancy to compass it. This, as I say, my first voluntary writing since April 9th. after wh. I pitched into bed: then to Cornwallâ€”no note of that; then back; saw Elly: then to M.H. Home yesterday for a fortnights trial. And the blood has mounted to my head. Wrote 1880 this morning.
