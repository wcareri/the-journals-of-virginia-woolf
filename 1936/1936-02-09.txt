### Sunday 9 February

It is now the 9th of Feb & I have three weeks in which to finish my book. Hence this stolen minuteâ€”stolen while waiting to go round to the meeting at Adrianâ€™sâ€”is the first I have had in wh. to make even this elementary note. I work 3 hours in the morning: 2 often after tea. Then my head swells & I sleep.
