### Saturday 29 February

Leap Year day. A great deal of fuss about the marmots. In fact, these weeks of solitude, seeing no one, only going round to Nessa, refusing all partiesâ€”Sheppard, to see Greek Play, Ellis Roberts to meet Max, & so onâ€”have a space & quiet thats rather favourable to private fun. I become so absorbed in The Years that I take the other world as a kind of amplification, variation in another key. Nothing interferes for the moment; & I rush on; should in fact rush on this morning; but have done so much copyingâ€”the Oxford Street sceneâ€”that I cant cut ice any more. L. is lunching with the Robsons. It is drizzling. It is a damp dismal day. All Duncanâ€™s pictures have been refusedâ€”to give a scrap of upper air newsâ€”by the Q. Mary. A great Bloomsbury agitation set on foot. But they think Sir Percy Bates when persuaded, gently, by the whole connoisseurship of London, may be bamboozled into relenting. All the Cabinet has been murdered in Tokyo. Lydia is a great success at Cambridge. Clive in Paris. I read Quennel on Byron: dont like that young mans clever agile thin blooded mind: & very little else that counts. L. began this morning against Mabel again: because she asked for a rise. So I must face that with other accumulations during my hybernation. And now to lunch. & then to take tickets for Charlie Chaplin. And Iâ€™ve never recorded my request from Lady Oxfordâ€”that I shd. write an obituary of her writing; or my lunch there; & the little drawn up painted alert nervous brilliant woman, as hard as nails, but a good mimic.
