### Friday 10 January London.

Back again. A great gale all yesterday & a dusk over everything & rain, so that the comfort I had expected was diminished. Origo to tea; & wants to dine next week. All the same I will keep my hands on the reins. For, to tell the truth, this six weeks is going to be a most perilous enterprise. How on earth to finish, to get typed, to correct by the end of Feb? To show my state, I mistook 11 for 12 on my watch this morning; so shut up my book & stopped work with such relief that, when I discovered the mistake, I couldnâ€™t bring myself to do the extra hour & did Roger instead. How then am I going to finish? My head is so springless. What I plan is to finish this long last lap for typing say by Monday or Tuesday: send it to Mabel, & then begin at the chapter I stopped at, & go through again, & so keep the whole reading till Iâ€™ve got it all retyped. But can I do this in the time? Iâ€™m going to space my days as carefully as I can, resting after lunch, & reading only with the skin of the eye. But its the chronic problem of people that is the crux (what a word). Heres Dadie asking us to Cambridge; & old Ethel on the alert; & the usual letters. The Câ ambridge Uâ niversity Lit. Soc, Dadie says, is asking me to lecture. Let it. A text for my letter. Origo rather contorted: says Italy is blind red hot devoted patriotic: has thrown her wedding ring into the cauldron too. Anticipates a long war, & then the peace they cd have had a month ago. They are more set than on the great war. 2 meatless days a week.
