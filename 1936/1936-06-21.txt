### Sunday 21 June

After a week of intense sufferingâ€”indeed mornings of tortureâ€”& Iâ€™m not exaggeratingâ€”pain in my headâ€”a feeling of complete despair & failureâ€”a head inside like the nostrils after hay feverâ€”here is a cool quiet morning again, a feeling of relief; respite: hope. Just done the Robsons: think it good.

I am living so constrainedly; so repressedly: I cant make notes of life. Everything is planned, battened down. I do Â½ an hour down here; go up, often in despair, lie down; walk round the square: come back do another 10 lines. Then to Lords yesterday. Always with a feeling of having to repress; control. I see people lying on sofa between tea & dinner. Rose Mâ . Eâ â th Bowen. Nessa. Sat in the square last night. Saw the dripping green leaves. Thunder & lightning. Purple sky. N. & Aâ . discussing 4/8 time. Cats stealing round. L. dining with Tom & Bella. A very strange, most remarkable summer. New emotions: humility: impersonal joy: literary despair. I am learning my craft in the most fierce conditions. Really reading Flaubertâ€™s letters I hear my own voice cry out Oh art! Patience. Find him consoling, admonishing. I must get this book quietly strongly daringly into shape. But it wont be out till next year. Yet I think it has possibilities, cd I seize them. I am trying to cut the characters deep in a phrase: to pare off & compact scenes; to envelop the whole in a medium.
