### Friday 20 March

Book again very good: very bad yesterday. And what a horrid evening. First Lady Simon & Harry: then Raymond: then, for dinner, down I go to the Press, to see if my Macaulayâ€™s come: & theres a tap on the window. I thought it was a little dressmakers apprentice come with my dress. But it was oh dearâ€”a girl, fainting. Can I have a drop of water? She was hardly able to walk. Sat on the area steps while I got one. Then I took her in: got L.: hotted soup. But it was a horrible thing. Shed been walking all day to get work, had neuritisâ€”cdnt sew, had had a cup of tea for breakfast, lived in one room alone in Bethnal Green. At first she cd hardly speakâ€”â€œIâ€™m hungryâ€ she said. Gradually livened. Half dazed. Said You look like brother & sister, both have long noses. Iâ€™m a Jewessâ€”a curious stress on the word as if a confession. Soâ€™s he I said. Then she perked up a little. But my Godâ€”no one to help her, she said. Friends? Oh they only think of enjoying themselves. May I take this home? taking a bun. We gave her tongue, 2 eggs, & 5/- Did you make this yourselfâ€”of the soup. Can you afford itâ€”of the money. And a mere wispâ€”22â€”suffering. Never saw unhappiness, poverty so tangible. And felt its our fault. And she apologised. And what could we do. I shall stay in bed if Iâ€™m feeling bad & then go to the Labour Exchange. But I cant get any work. Think of one of our â€˜classâ€™: & this is what we exact.

Now its raining, & I suppose .. well, whats the use of thinking? As usual what was so vivid I saw it all the evening becomes stylised when I write. Some horror become visible: but in human form. And she may live 20 years â€¦ What a system.
