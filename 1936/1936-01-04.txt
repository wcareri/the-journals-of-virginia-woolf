### Saturday 4 January

The weather has improved, & we have decided to stay till Wednesday. It will now of course rain. But I will make some good resolutions: to read as few weekly papers, which are apt to prick me into recollection of myself, as possible, until this Years is over; to fill my brain with remote books & habits; not to think of Answers to C.ds; & altogether to be as fundamental & as little superficial, to be as physical & as little apprehensive, as possible. And now to do Roger; & then to relax. For, to tell the truth, my head is still all nerves; & one false move means racing despair, exaltation, & all the rest of that familiar misery: that long scale of unhappiness. So I have ordered a sirloin & we shall go for a drive. L. is happier: will now do his trees.
