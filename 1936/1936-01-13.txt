### Monday 13 January

The precious days are ticking over. About 30 now left me, & how much to do! But my new method is working I think: each hour mapped in bed, & kept to, so far. Ann & Cr. Strachey to dine last night. Christopher a charming babbling humane boy, with a great deal of Oliverâ€”in the voice chieflyâ€”some of the Costello coarseness, of feature; but far more dash & vitality than a pure blooded Strachey. Laughter. Talk, of course, of Gumbo & Ray; Ray & Gumbo getting naked & swimming. Yet, though the thought of R.â€™s nakedness makes me squirm, she has humanised her son. He eats 4 eggs, on equal terms, as he says, with her, for Sunday supper. And he was concerned that in Gumboâ€™s new house, ordered from a catalogue, there is only a little box room for the servant. How very unlike Lytton! But he says that Oliver is also humane. Ann in her red; an ungainly girl; but silent, brooding, with opinions, chiefly medical & political. She sells the Daily Worker (3 copies) then breaks in on Cr. who is playing Bach on the piano, & demands eggs & biscuits for lunch at 3.30. Nessa, Clive, Duncan came in: but we drew the young on to chatter about B.B.

I walked somewhere on the Sunday streets & L. went to Mrs W. & met Babs &c. with the Alsatian, which had to be returned. She had just bought it in Pug Row, if thats the name of the dog selling street in Whitechapel. Fogâ€”mitigated fog this morning.
