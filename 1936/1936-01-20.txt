### Monday 20 January

This story I repeated to Duncan last night. He also had met Marjorie at The Times. She had flung her arms round him & kissed him. Another side of Marjorieâ€™s story. They were badly beaten, Nessa & Duncan; but both elected to the Cttee all the same. They had not arranged any speaker on their side, &, as neither of them spoke, & Nan & Ethel were silent, & the others had actually written out speeches, the result as they say was a foregone conclusion.

And the King is not dead, but the same. It is a very fine bright day; I think I must force myself to go to Lewisâ€™s & get a dress made; &â€”&â€”we are dining with Alice Ritchie. Sibyl is only too ready to come.
