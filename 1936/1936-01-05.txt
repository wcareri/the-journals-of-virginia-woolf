### Sunday 5 January

I have had another morning at the old plague. I rather suspect that I have said the thing I meant, & any further work will only muddle. Further work must be merely to tidy & smooth out. This seems likely because Iâ€™m so calm. I feel well, thats done. I want to be off on something else. Whether good or bad, I dont know. And my head is quiet today, soothed by reading The Trumpet Major last night, & a drive to the floods. The clouds were an extraordinary tropical birds wing colour: an impure purple; & the lakes reflected it, & there were droves of plover black & white; & all very linear in line & pure & subtle in colour. How I slept! Gray again today: but I shall not go to tea with Clive & Raymond. No news of Morgan. I cd. hardly listen to the news for fear they wd. begin We regret â€¦
