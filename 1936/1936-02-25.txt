### Tuesday 25 February

And this will show how hard I work. This is the first momentâ€”this 5 minutes before lunchâ€”that Iâ€™ve had to write here. I work all the morning: I work from 5 to 7 most days. Then Iâ€™ve had headaches. Vanquish them by lying still & binding books & reading D. Copperfield. I have sworn that the script shall be ready, typed & corrected, on the 10th March. L. will then read it. And Iâ€™ve still all the Richmond & El. scene to type out; many corrections in that most accursed raid scene to make; all this to have typed; if I can by the 1st which is Sunday; & then I must begin at the beginning & read straight through. So Iâ€™m quite unable either to write here, or to do Roger. On the whole, Iâ€™m enjoying itâ€”thats oddâ€”though in the ups & downs, & with no general opinion.
