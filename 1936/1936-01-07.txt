### Tuesday 7 January

I have again copied out the last pages, & I think got the spacing better. Many details & some fundamentals remain. The snow scene for example. & I suspect a good many unfaced passages remain. But I preserve my sense that its stated; & I need only use my craft not my creation. A pouring dayâ€”a day so wet that L. had to come in a mackintosh, & to spare him I drank my coffee in the dining room by candlelight. No news of Morgan? Why? Joeâ€™s faithless. All the angles of the twigs have white drops on them. Thats Hardyâ€™s gift by the way. minute obstinately individual observations. But how his reputation ever mounted, considering the flatness, tedium, & complete absence of gift of the T. Major, I cant say: & wd like to discover. I think he had genius & no talent. And the English love genius. Iâ€™m English enough too to feel my own past as a peasant expand his notes. Tom, the American, cant; feels nothing I suppose. I think of taking sentences from great writers & expanding them. But then Iâ€™m always feathering round for some way of liberating my critical apprehensions which dont fit the strait jacket of the regular Times leader any longer. Anyhow this rain dissolves my guilt in wishing to go back. And Iâ€™ve had one or two sublime quiet evenings hereâ€”evenings of immunity, using that word in its highest sense.
