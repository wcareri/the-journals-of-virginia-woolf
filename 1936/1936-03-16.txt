I ought not to be doing this: but I cannot go on bothering with those excruciating pages any more. I shall come in at 3 & do some; & again after tea. For my own guidance: I have never suffered, since The Voyage Out, such acute despair on re-reading, as this time. On Saturday for instance: there I was, faced with complete failure: & yet the book is being printed. Then I set to: in despair: thought of throwing it away; but went on typing. After an hour, the line began to taughten. Yesterday I read it again; & I think it may be my best book. However â€¦ Iâ€™m only at the Kings death. I think the change of scene is whats so exhausting: the catching people plumb in the middle: then jerking off. Every beginning seems lifelessâ€”& then I have to retype. Iâ€™ve more or less done 250: & theres 700 to do. A walk down the river & through Richmond Park did more than anything to pump blood in. Adrian though has had another queer seizure: suddenly became unconscious: & was then very sick. This reminds me of father falling down, & I thought he was on fire. Politics have slightly died down; We had a meeting on Saturday: I went to E. Bowen & sat in her glass shining â€˜contemporaryâ€™ room. Like a French pictureâ€”2 ladies sitting looking at the Lake. She is much like a picture. We discussed poor Rose M.â€™s terrible flurry about E. not wanting to see her. R. stopped me in Tâ orrington Sqre to gasp out this heart cry Does Eth no longer want to know me? I went to fetch something she had said she was out â€¦ there was a party .. reviewing young men. In fact they were BBC young men. But what a state of mind this shows!
