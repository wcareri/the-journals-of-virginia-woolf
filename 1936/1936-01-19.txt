### Sunday 19 January

I open this, forced by a sense of what is expected by the public, to remark that Kipling died yesterday; & that the King (George 5th) is probably dying today. The death of Kipling has set all the old war horses of the press padding round their stalls; & the papers have to eke out 5 or 6 columns with the very bare bulletinâ€”condition causes anxietyâ€”which they supplement with biographies of doctors, of nurses, pictures of Sandringham, remarks of old villagers, gossip about the little Princesses in their cherry coloured coats, a snow man, &c. But the fact remains that all the Princes have gathered together, & I suppose at any moment the butler may come in, just as theyre finishing dinner, & say King Edward 8th, upon whichâ€”but I need hardly invent that scene having already so many on my hands.

Privately, I rang up Nessa at 6 yesterday & was alarmed by the agitated & breathless way in which she said Not now: Iâ€™ll ring later. This left me to imagine any number of catastrophes, but I find this morning that I interrupted the crisis of that London Group meeting, which went entirely against Nessa & Duncanâ€™s cabal; they dismissed the President, & elected Sickert. And now, at the same time that the King dies, Nessa & Duncan think of resigning & starting a new Group. It is coldish snowy weather: the snow half melts half freezes; & I pad along, & Judith dined here, & we talked to James & Alix, walked by the Serpentine & must now lunch.

I went up to an elderly stout woman reading the paper at The Times Book Club the other day. It was Margery Strachey. What are you doing? I said. Nothing! she replied. â€œIâ€™ve got nowhere to go & nothing to do.â€

And I left her, sitting reading The Times.
