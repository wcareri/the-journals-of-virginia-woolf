### Wednesday 18 March

It now seems to me so goodâ€”still talking about The Yearsâ€”that I cant go on correcting. In fact I do think the scene at Witterings is about the best, in that line, I ever wrote. First proofs just come: so thereâ€™s a cold douche waiting me there. And I cant concentrate this morningâ€”must make up Letter to an Englishman. I think, once more, that is the final form it will take, because after all separate letters break continuity so

Another pause. This wandering comes from having Karin to dinner last night; & Kot before that; the same as ever: rather heavier, yellower; & then Eâ lizabeâ th Williamson afterwards; & thoâ€™ it wasnâ€™t late, I felt like a wet towel, sitting there. My brain wont grip. Also it is the first day of Springâ€”hot: swarming. And, God damn these persistent old women, I must go to tea with Mrs Grosvenor. Oh what vampires they areâ€”my blood must feed that old wretch. I dislike goingâ€”no hat, want to lie & dream after tea. Then theres Lady Simon tomorrow. And Rodmellâ€¦. Then one week of peace I will have before a week end at the Cecils.

But Karin was very nice: so brisk headed; & somehow sad; pathetic. Said sheâ€™d found Adrian unconscious & how awful it was. Yet they separated. A kind of suffering & capacity for something else in her, somehow, like a dog whose bonesâ€™ been snatched away, but no longer snarls. E.W. very much to the point too.
