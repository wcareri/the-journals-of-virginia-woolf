### Tuesday 21 January

The King died last night. We were dining with Alice Ritchie, & drove back past Buckingham Palace. It was a clear dry night, rather windy & rather cold. As we turned the corner & came by the Palace we saw cars drawn up all along the Mall. There were thin lights. On the white monument people were standing: only everybody seemed to be moving. There was a cluster like a swarm of bees, round the railings. Some people were plastered against the railings, holding on to the bars. There was a discreet frame, like a text, holding a bulletin. We had to drive on past the Monument before the policeman, who spoke with weary politeness, would let us stop. Then we got out, & walked back, crossing with difficulty because cars were passing all the time, & tried to shove our way through the crowd. But it was impossible. So I asked a policeman â€œWhat is the latest bulletin?â€ And he said, It has not been issued. So I said But what is the latest news. I havent heard. (We had only seen Strength diminishing on the placards as we drove out) to which he replied â€œHis majestyâ€™s life is drawing to a peaceful close.â€ This he said without conviction, as if he were reciting words put into his mouth, but with a certain official tolerance. There was some agitation & excitement; many foreigners talking German; a large proportion of distinguished looking men, in semi evening dress; everyone indeed looked rather tall; but by no means tragic; yet not gay; rather suppressing their excitement; & it was all very brightly lit. As we turned away, a fireworkâ€”a silver gilt sputtering fizzing torch began bubbling up, like a signal, like a festival, but it was presumably a photographers light. The crowd clustering on the rails became chalky white for a few seconds; & then we got into the car & drove home. The streets were very empty. But save for the occasional placardâ€”it was now â€œThe King is Dyingâ€â€”there was nothing out of the way. What I took for guns booming was only the banging of the loose door in the mews. But at 3 this morning, L. was woken by paper boys shouting in the street. The King had in fact died at 12.5. He was dead when we were outside the palace. There were one or two narrow lights in the little top windows, I remember. Otherwise all the white curtains were drawn.

Most of the men in Southampton Row wear black ties wh. are brand new, or dark blue ties, which are the nearest they can get. In the stationers the woman spoke with a subdued kindness as if we were both mourning a great uncle we had never seen. The woman in Dennisons said she often thought herself it was absurd only to sell plain labels by the thousand. A very fine cold day. Sun shining.
