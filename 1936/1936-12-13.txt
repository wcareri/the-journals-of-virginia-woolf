### Sunday 13 December

Then we had the Broadcast. â€œPrince Edward speaking from Windsor Castleâ€â€”as the emotional butler announced. Upon which, with a slight stammer at first, in a steely strained voice, as if he were standing with his back against the wall, the King (but that is already vanishing & attaching itself to York) began: â€œAt long last.. I can speak to you â€¦.. The woman I love â€¦ I who have none of those blessingsâ€¦â€ Well, one came in touch with human flesh, I suppose. Also with a set pigheaded steely mind â€¦ a very ordinary young man; but the thing had never been done on that scale. One man set up in the Augusta Tower at Windsor addressing the world on behalf of himself & Mrs Simpson. Out in the Square there was complete emptiness. All the life had been withdrawn to listen, to judge. Miss Strachan clerk wdnâ€™t listen, for fear of sympathising. And then Edward went on in his steely way to say the perfectly correct things, about the Constitution, the P. Minister, her majesty my mother. Finally he wound up, God Save the King with a shout; after which I heard his sigh go up, a kind of whistle. Then silence. Complete silence. Then Mr Hibbert saying. And now we shut down. Good night everybody. Goodnight; & we were tucked up in our beds.
