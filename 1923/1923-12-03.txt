### Monday 3 December

Back from Rodmell; unable to settle in; therefore I write diary. How often I have said this! An odd psychological factâ€”that I can write when Iâ€™m too jangled to read. Moreover, I want to leave as few pages blank as possible; & the end of the year is only some three weeks off.

I meant to write about the change which I discovered last May (about) from seclusion & obscurity to some degree of prosperity & society. My prediction was that we were on the verge of something of the kind. And I see now I shall get my Saxon & my house. Oh thereâ€™s Adrianâ€™s catastrophe to recordâ€”now 2 weeks old. Nessa rang me up in the middle of dinner with Tom here. â€œAdrian & Karin are going to separate.â€ You could have knocked me down with a feather, & Clive too, so he says. The devoted & inseparable couple! And it seemed (thenâ€”this is no longer so) tragic to me; & I was overcome, at hearing theyâ€™d been unhappy for years; & then went & told Tom & Leonard; & then 2 days later, met Adrian in the bathroom at 46; kissed his hand, & he burst into tears. Its an agony! he cried. So we went upstairs holding hands, (I to get ready for my speech at the School of Economics) & he walked to the bus, & told me how it had never been rightâ€”almost, but never quite right. They hadnâ€™t quarrelled. I am too shaky to write. But then he stayed here & I felt come over me the old despair; the crouching servile feeling which is my lowest & worst; the desire for praise, which he never gets; & the old futile comparisons between his respect for Nessa & his disrespect for me came over me, that made me so wretched at Fitzroy Sqre. To my amusement, I found that Nessa, who had been cordial & sanguine about him had changed her view, owing to his visiting her, & now only foretells with despair several long silent sittings. She says, & Clive says, that Karin did it; Karin felt it more than he did. She felt all I used to feel: the snub; the check; the rebuke; the fastidiousness; the lethargy. Poor old Adrian!â€”he now subsides into a flat in Mecklenburgh Sqre; & drifts phantomlike forever. Undoubtedly Haynes was right: the D.N.B. crushed his life out before he was born. It gave me a twist of the head too. I shouldnâ€™t have been so clever, but I should have been more stable, without that contribution to the history of England. Now for a hot bath.
