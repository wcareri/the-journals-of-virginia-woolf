### Monday 6 August

I have ruined my mornings work by making bread & buns, which require constant voyages to the kitchen. The demon then always suggests that I shall read The Hours. Sheer weak dribble it seems to me (read in these circumstances). My comfort is that I can have at it in any way I like; & if it still goes wrong, to the fire with it. Nor do I think it wrong altogether. Whenever there is a breach in my content, all disparaging criticisms creep in; meanly enough, the good ones keep off.

We went over to Charleston yesterday. Although thinking quite well of ourselves, we were not well received by the painters. There they sat like assidâ uâ ous children at a task in a bedroomâ€”Roger, Nessa, & Duncan; Roger on chair in foreground; Nessa on sofa, Duncan on bed. In front of them was one jar of flowers, & one arrangement of still live. Roger was picking out his blue flower very brightly. For some reason, the talk was not entirely congenial. I suspect myself of pertness & so on. Clive was sitting in the drawing room window reading Dryden.

A very good editionâ€”I want to ask your husband some questionsâ€”Will he take an articleâ€¦. V. O I thought your Lytton article very good â€¦ Van. Teaâ€™s readyâ€”V. What am I to do with my cigarette?

Hollyhocks, decapitated, swam in a bowl; there was a loaf for tea, & a long slab of cake. Roger, I cant help thinking has become a little querulous with years. His grievances torment him; he talks of them too much. After tea, Angelica had her dollsâ€™ tea party in the window, & beat Clive, & when he cried, ran of her own accord & picked him a flowerâ€”which was a sensitive womanly act. She is sensitiveâ€”minds being laughed at (as I do). She said she wanted a â€˜slideâ€™ in her hair. â€œDont laugh at meâ€ she said, petulantly, to Roger.

I should say that the weather is perfect, soft as a cushion, blue to the heart. A gospel caravan has just pitched its tent near, & the other night 10 young men bawled hymnsâ€¦. But I am laying my mind wander to The Hours. Now its a strange thing that if I have no gift for novel writing, yet it should so absorb meâ€”I cant diagnose my own caseâ€”which reminds me that Iâ€™ve started upon the revision of my old articles; & feel rather charitable to that side of my faculty. Leonard is at this moment beginning again his book, which I daresay he has not touched since last Christmas.
