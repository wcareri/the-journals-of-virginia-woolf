### Tuesday 11 September

Here we are back from The Knoll, Studland. It was reckoned that we could have got to France in less time, reckoned at Charleston last week (on a hot September afternoon, with the children putting the kitten in a dead tree, which Duncan carried about as if it had been a Christmas tree; & then I read my play, & then I got excited, & then we bicycled homeâ€”all these things I should like to remember). I wanted to observe Lydia as a type for Rezia; & did observe one or two facts. It was very hot at Lulworth, & we sat with the sun in our eyes on a verandah having tea. Suddenly she got cross, frowned, complained of the heat, seemed about to cry, precisely like a child of six. She was concerned to know what Leonard meant by coupling her with me among the â€œsilliesâ€. It means that you can both be beaten, Maynard said. Maynard is grown very gross & stout, especially when he wraps his leopard spotted dressing gown tight round his knees & stands in front of the fire. I was looking at him censoriously, through the eyes of good M. Murry (4th no. of the Adelphi devoted to abuse of Mortimer & Bunny). He has a queer swollen eel like look, not very pleasant. But his eyes are remarkable, & as I truly said when he gave me some pages of his new book to read, the process of mind there displayed is as far ahead of me as Shakespeareâ€™s. True, I donâ€™t respect it so much. But to continue. The poet Rylands was there & Mortimer. Dadyâ€™s hair (he became Dady at 10 a.m. Monday at Poole station) is precisely the colour & consistency of the husk of strawâ€”that thin glistening fabric which one splits off the stalk of straw. Add to this a blue cornflower coloured tweed suit, his apple red face, & blue eyes & you haveâ€”well, merely a corn flower to me, but to Raymond the most intoxicatingly beautiful young man that it is possible to imagine. Unfortunately (for R.) Dady did not share these views. He, being honest Cambridge, puts R. down for â€œa very clever Oxford manâ€. L. is inclined to agree; indeed he calls R. â€œslimyâ€. He patted Dady, enclosed him, as he sat on the floor in his arms, praised his beauty to his face; & one must agree, I think, that all exhibitions of sâ€”â€”feeling have something silly, mawkish, about them, though why I canâ€™t say. Anyhow, R. had a cold in his nose, & his nose is his worst feature, square at the tip, like something that has to stand on a table. His features are not good; his hair dark; & his manners either a little too clever or too flattering. Yet, I liked him better this week end than last. Such are the elements of our party. I was interested to observe, & not much caring, as indeed happens oftener than not nowadays, to make a splash of my own. For one thing, we are grown so old now; & the young are so literal in their respect. We motored to Lulworth on Sunday, or rather to Warbarrow, which we climbed & walked 5 miles over the down. My shoes interfered with my pleasure rather. But I thought of the year 1830, & how most of England then looked as this coast looked, bays with their sweep untenanted, only coastguards & gray cottages, & rowing boats making off to little shipsâ€”And then I caught a view or two which Iâ€™ve no doubt will keep for some years & then be used: the red heather & waterâ€”the mediterranean aspectâ€”but by the bye I must remember how curiously my week end transitory feeling conditioned all this: as if I were seeing something isolated, from a train. The clear water was very moving to me, with the pale stones showing under it like jelly fish. Lulworth of course was all skittles, & men playing in a yard; & people parading in front of a wall which, like an Italian wall, encloses the headland. An odd haze came down, so that we saw nothing distinctly: only outlines. Then we stopped, Maynard liking I think to be showman, at Bindon Abbey, having just before seen the old Manor house where Tess slept, or lived. At Bindon Lydia lay in her pink jacket with the white fur in a Bishops tombâ€”a kind of shaped tank sunk in the earth on the way up to the Calvary, & got up with leaves sticking to her cloak. She lay quite still, acting death, her muscular dancers legs in white silk stockings lying with the soles of the feet touching, & Maynard & I standing by. What did she think about? About Maynard, & her death, & what would happen before? Heaven knows. Bindon is all grass & trees & long stretches of water, like those at Hampton Court. We sat on the mound of the Calvary, the cross being gone, & Maynard talked about palaeolithic man & an interesting theory about the age of manâ€”how the beginning of history about 5,000 b.c. is only the beginning of another lap in the race; others, many others, having been run previously & obliterated by ice ages. Meanwhile Raymond took his Dady along the side walks by the fish ponds. It is a damp romantic place; & one wh. perhaps I shall never see again, as I told L. I had an odd feeling that it is queer to find such places lying unknown in the country, inland. I canâ€™t get hold of it now. I am perhaps encouraged by Proust to search out & identify my feelings, but I have always felt this kind of thing in great profusion, only not tried to capture it, or perhaps lacked skill & confidence. To return:â€”Dady has an ingratiating manner of pawing ladies old enough to be his mother. He threw out an idea that he might join the Press. The printing mania has come upon him & Sebastian, & it looks as if we might now start a Cambridge branch;â€”he asked, lightly, for he is not emphatic & very happy I should think, with all his interests & successes, & no inhibitions & good health, & money in prospect, & an editor to print his poems, & a year more at Cambridge, & a possible fellowship & so forthâ€”he asked lightly whether he might lodge with us in the holidays, & pay his way by working the press. So you see how the future branches & extends: I mean there are ways down the forest; roads leading to right & left hitherto unseen.

It was hot & prosy in London. I bought China at Healâ€™s, & we lunched with Hubert Hâ endersonâ€”a small, testy, unheroic man, vaguely on the look out for offence, & suspecting I think our superior vitality, & longing for a compliment, which being honest at the moment, I could not give him. He ought to have stuck to Cambridge, as, I suspect, he begins to think. He is less of a personage than I thought. Once the flush of the adventure is past, he finds himself hard put to it to keep his end up. Maynard is his standby. Bloomsbury his pest. He wants safe, charming articles, like Mollyâ€™s childhood series.

Any really good article, said L., is bound to be disliked intensely & liked intensely.

H.H. didnâ€™t much agree to this. He thought they could be liked by everyone. He was disappointed by Lytton, who gets Â£40 for 15,00 words, & I think by me. Left to himself, he would soon make The Nation into the Westminster Gazette. But I donâ€™t pretend to care very profoundly. Unfortunately, Desmond has cut up crusty, & L. is landed with F. Bâ irrell for whom he must provide Â£150 p.A. Mortimer I think, descends safely but a little ingloriously on the New Statesman side of the fence. And Bertie Russell says he will resign.
