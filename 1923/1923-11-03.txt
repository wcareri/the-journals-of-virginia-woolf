### Saturday 3 November

And now Iâ€™ve found a house 35 Woburn Square. Yes, shall I write that address often? Certainly I hope to. For me it would be worth Â£500 a year in pleasure. Think of the music I could hear, the people I could see, easily, unthinkingly. And then comes before me the prospect of walking through the city streets; starting off early, some day L.â€™s at the office, & walking say to Wapping; & then to tea at the office. Why this so obsesses my mind I donâ€™t know. It was a beautiful clear November day, yesterday, when I went up & past our house (with green doors opposite the mews) & the squares with their regular houses, & their leafless trees, & people very clearly outlined filled me with joy. Indeed, it was so lovely in the Waterloo Road that it struck me that we were writing Shakespeare; by which I mean that when live people, seeming happy, produce an effect of beauty, & you dont have it offered as a work of art, but it seems a natural gift of theirs, thenâ€”what was I meaning?â€”somehow it affected me as I am affected by reading Shakespeare. No: its life; going on in these very beautiful surroundings. As for the house question I am solving it tonight in this fashion. We will take the house, live in our own flat upstairsâ€”a most lovable & delightful little place; have Nelly to cook; let out the next floor to Saxon; Lottie shall do for him. Then Dady (I think, but am not sure) shall be lodged on the ground floor, entirely apart, with his own servant in the basement, & control of the press which is also lodged there. This seems to me a perfectly feasible solution of innumerable difficulties. Of course Marjorie remains. We broke Dadie to her two days ago. Leonard did it in so many words.

M.: But I dont think I shall like that.

V.: Did you dislike him?

M.: I shant like being under him. Heâ€™d make me typewrite all day. And I suppose I should have to do what he told me?

L.: He would be in the same position to you that we are.

M.: Iâ€™ve never minded working under you. But this is the first time it happened. Iâ€™ve never been able to work with other people. I quarrelled with the headmistress, where I was before this.

(here is an example of the resolute, uncoloured honesty with which she behaves. But she did not show up otherwise in an attractive lightâ€”except that one canâ€™t blame these unimaginative people for anything. She fears the loss of prestige. She is jealous, rather grasping, wants her way; but of course knows all this. That is the modern advantage.

But I have wasted my time drawing a plan of 35 on the opposite page. Nothing runs away with time like these house dreams. I must read Sophocles. After 20 years, I now know how to read Greek quick (with a crib in one hand) & with pleasure. This is for the eternal book. And my mind whips off to rentsâ€”how much can we ask for this house? Iâ€™m heartless about poor old Hogarth, where for 9 years we have been so secure. My mind whips away from Ka, & Altounyan, except that Ka was more like a sack of some of the commoner garden vegetables than ever. She has some worm gnawing at her, some persistent desire to impress us, with her romantic life, with Willâ€™s romantic nature. Now thereâ€™s nothing human beings so quickly see as this motive, & none they more resent. For one thing, it implies some divergence of interest. Sheâ€™s thinking not of you, but of how to impress you. More serious, though, is the dilution of her own interest, since she does not put her full weight on it, but only on half of it, thinking as she must, of making it impress. Her condescension is very curious. She is, or seems to be, one of the county; this she enjoys. But she is aware that being county doesnâ€™t carry far in London, or even Richmond. Anyhow she tells too many stories about the strange figures who drive up to the Eagles Nest. Gordon Bottom ley, the Ranee of Sarawak. She dwells too much upon good Willâ€™s passion for the conscription of natives by the French. All this protestingâ€”thats whats at the bottom of it. But she was in some way very pathetic about Rupert. How Mrs Brooke had suddenly smiled at Mark as Ka had never seen her smile, exactly like Rupert. But if I hadnâ€™t driven her off rather arbitrarily to the past, I donâ€™t know how we should have got through the evening. I was glad to hear Leonard & Altounyan coming down. But I must descend to the basement, & see whats doing with Cliveâ€™s cover; which Leonard does for 8 hours daily.
