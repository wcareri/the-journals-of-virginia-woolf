### Friday 16 November

No we didnâ€™t take 35 Woburn Square, & the colour has gone out of it, & I dont want to write about it at the moment. Iâ€™m back from lunch Lady Colefax, meet Anrep at the Tate, tea Marjorie, discuss Ralph; Leonard back from Rodmell: & in rather a fritter, too much so to read Euripides. Indeed, Iâ€™ve been talking to Hugh Walpoleâ€”not an impressive manâ€”a man who protests too much; an uneasy, prosperous vain man, who harbours some grudge against clever intellectuals & yet respects them, would like to be one. He has the look of a kindly solicitor or banker; red cheeks; very small bright eyes; a genial, but not profound or cordial manner. We talked of contemporary fame. He dwelt a good deal upon the different sets & critics, & how no book was good in the same parish. Somehow it all referred to him. An uninteresting mind, & really not able to cast a shadow even upon me. I did not feel knocked over, dashed to pieces, or anything very vividly, except that he was slightly in awe of me. There was old Lady Horner, with her grey big eyes very far apart in a face creased & crumpled like some old faded gloveâ€”an interesting subtle face; a mind worn down by society, into that kind of simple ease which enhances even small talk. I mean what she said was so freely & easily said that it had a manner with it. Spacious gardens & money have gone to it. Poor unhappy old womanâ€”Am I sentimental to think so often of peoples unhappiness, or is it indirectly some tribute to myself? Lytton is very suave in such societyâ [;] sits in the shadow & now & then draws his sword effectively. Desmond of course does his jolly delightful tricksâ€”eating & drinking meanwhileâ€”acting an actress who cleans her arms like a fly in Nassau. As for Ly Colefax, there she sits painted & emphatic at the head of her table, broadcheeked, a little coarse, kindly glass eyed, affectionate to me almost, capable, apparently disinterestedâ€”I mean if she likes to listen to clever talk & to buy it with a lunch of four courses & good wine; I see no harm in it. Its a taste; not a vice. Off we streamed at 3. It amuses me to hear Ly Horner asking the servants to find out Lady Lovatâ€™s telephone number. These free & easy ways remind me of Ly Bath, the Herbertsâ€”little accidents that impressed me years ago. Yet all it amounts to is that Ly Horner drives about London in a motor car, & has a sort of airiness instead of stuffiness about her. So to the Tate with Lytton. Lytton & I donâ€™t need much preliminary.

Heres my bookâ€”Q.V. in French.  
I daresay it reads better in French

He has almost bought a house near Hungerford, in the downs, but hesitates over the last Â£500. There are no drains & no water. Still I advised the leap, as I always advise leaps. And then there was Anrep, & his tinted floor, all raying out in greens & browns, like the waves of a sea; not a good metaphor, for it is really very compact, strong, & contained. Droves of schoolchildren kept sweeping over it. He explained it to me, smelling rather too much of whisky. Then he drove me to Waterloo. Now I lose interest in these facts, much as I do in writing my novels, & thus have to find a way out of saying them. Hugh Walpole wd. not be bored I suppose; therefore he is convincing. Iâ€™m now writing my Greek chapter in alternate bursts of hot & cold. It seems so superficial, & not worth foisting off upon a world provided with so much knowledge already. Yet I really must write a book about facts once in a way. And I cant keep grinding at fiction, which however goes easier this last lap than before. Here though I come lamely & softly & comfortably to a full stop. I must add that â€œIâ€™ve broken off with Ralph. We had nowhere to meet. And its trueâ€”he ought to be in a park; not in restaurants. And I had two dreadful scenes with Cyril. He wont let him come home, or let me stay away with him. I dont want to lie about it. So weâ€™ve broken offâ€. Rather to her credit, I think, & certainly to our relief.
