### Sunday 22 July

A great many conversations to record: dined with Mortimer & Schofield Thayer the other night & went on with them to Maryâ€™s.

Mortimer is Oxford, & thus not nearly so easy to come to terms with as Sebastian for instance. He is all angle & polish. Wears a swallow tail white waistcoat; wants brilliancy not intimacy, is half a dandy.

M.: Its far better to write reviews than secondrate novels.

L.: I dont agree.

V.: I should like good criticism.

S.T.: Surely it would be much better if Rebecca West wrote criticism.

He was a cautious hardheaded American, edited the Dial. Like Mortimer he buys modern pictures; had met Roger outside the Nat. Gal. & said â€œSurely, Mr Fry? I have the advantage of you Mr Fry: I know you through your caricatures.â€ & so on.

But the talk was too formal & too conventional to bear writing out; or I cant do it; let me see, how did it go:

Adelphi abused.

Murryâ€™s writing abused. We tried to explain our dislike of K.â€™s stories.

M.: I used to have a boy to wait, & now only have an old woman

V.: But this is delicious (chicken in sauce) These are exquisiteâ€”china fruit from Venice.

A good account of flying from Tâ hayer.

S.T.: The pilot sayd he wdnâ€™t start. The company had sold three seats instead of two. But I had taken my passage 10 days before. I wouldnt budge. Some luggage was left. One man took his dachs. But we felt overweighted. Then we got above a storm. One leant over & saw the lightning dashing up at oneâ€™s face. It was terrible. I looked at my feet. One man kept going to the side & being sick. The other kept saying It is bad It is bad. And we all knew we were over weighted. Suddenly the engines stopped. We pitched up & down. We expected the whole thing to crash. The dog sat quite calm. Then after 10 minutes the engine began again. Towns looked like the handle of that salt cellar. Never again, no. And the pilot said heâ€™d been guiding with one hand & fumbling with the other & suddenly touched the right spring by chance, & the engine started. But we might just as well have dashed to the ground.
