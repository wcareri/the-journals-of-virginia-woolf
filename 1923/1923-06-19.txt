### Tuesday 19 June

I took up this book with a kind of idea that I might say something about my writingâ€”which was prompted by glancing at what K.M. said about her writing in the Doveâ€™s Nest. But I only glanced. She said a good deal about feeling things deeply: also about being pure, which I wont criticise, though of course I very well could. But now what do I feel about my writing?â€”this book, that is, The Hours, if thats its name? One must write from deep feeling, said Dostoevsky. And do I? Or do I fabricate with words, loving them as I do? No I think not. In this book I have almost too many ideas. I want to give life & death, sanity & insanity; I want to criticise the social system, & to show it at work, at its most intenseâ€”But here I may be posing. I heard from Ka this morning that she doesnâ€™t like In the Orchard. At once I feel refreshed. I become anonymous, a person who writes for the love of it. She takes away the motive of praise, & lets me feel that without any praise, I should be content to go on. This is what Duncan said of his painting the other night. I feel as if I slipped off all my ball dresses & stood nakedâ€”which as I remember was a very pleasant thing to do. But to go on. Am I writing The Hours from deep emotion? Of course the mad part tries me so much, makes my mind squint so badly that I can hardly face spending the next weeks at it. Its a question though of these characters. People, like Arnold Bennett, say I cant create, or didnâ€™t in Jâ€™s R, characters that survive. My answer isâ€”but I leave that to the Nation: its only the old argument that character is dissipated into shreds now: the old post-Dostoevsky argument. I daresay its true, however, that I havenâ€™t that â€˜realityâ€™ gift. I insubstantise, wilfully to some extent, distrusting realityâ€”its cheapness. But to get further. Have I the power of conveying the true reality? Or do I write essays about myself? Answer these questions as I may, in the uncomplimentary sense, & still there remains this excitement. To get to the bones, now Iâ€™m writing fiction again I feel my force flow straight from me at its fullest. After a dose of criticism I feel that Iâ€™m writing sideways, using only an angle of my mind. This is justification; for free use of the faculties means happiness. Iâ€™m better company, more of a human being. Nevertheless, I think it most important in this book to go for the central things, even though they dont submit, as they should however, to beautification in language. No, I donâ€™t nail my crest to the Murrys, who work in my flesh after the manner of the jigger insect. Its annoying, indeed degrading, to have these bitternesses. Still, think of the 18th Century. But then they were overt, not covert, as now.

I foresee, to return to The Hours, that this is going to be the devil of a struggle. The design is so queer & so masterful. Iâ€™m always having to wrench my substance to fit it. The design is certainly original, & interests me hugely. I should like to write away & away at it, very quick and fierce. Needless to say, I cant. In three weeks from today I shall be dried up.

Having made this very inadequate confession about the soul, I may turn now to the bodyâ€”which is money & America & Mr Crowninshield. Iâ€™m asked to write for Vanity Fair & shall be paid says Clive Â£25 for 1500 words: & get Â£15 from the Nation; & two months ago I was hawking articles of 5,000 words to Jack Squire for Â£13.

Do you like becoming famous? Marjorie asked me yesterday. The truth is Iâ€™m being pushed up, but many people are saying that I shant last, & perhaps I shant. So I return to my old feeling of nakedness as the backbone of my existence, which indeed it is.

For the rest, it is observed in Cornwall & the remoter parts of Weybridge that we are living through a storm of obloquy & must be entirely engrossed in the Nationâ€™s affairs. It is not so at Hogarth House: Iâ€™m no longer so excited about the contents of L.â€™s dispatch box. But one thing I do feel pretty certain about & here confide it to my diaryâ€”we must leave Richmond & set up in London. The arguments are so well known to me that I cant bother to write them down. But when things come upon me in a clap I generally achieve them, because they are then things that matter to me. Leonard remains to be converted, & my God, the moveâ€”the horrorâ€”the servants. Still this is lifeâ€”never to be sitting down for longer than one feels inclined.
