### Wednesday 5 September

Here is the usual half hour to be filled before dinner, & such a mass to stuff it with as would burst a whole day. K.M. used to write all day, she told me; poor Katherine, Iâ€™m always inclined to say unpleasant things about her, for some reason: The Adelphi I suppose. Our week end was Francis Birrell & Raymond Mortimer. Leonard says that F. is 3 quarters grown up, Tony F. spills out the whole contents of his head like a nice little boy; never stops talkingâ€”And what was it about?

About the Tennysons & his mother; my mother (The Bâ irrellâ€™s didnâ€™t much like her: they had a culte for Minny) his father; aunts & so on.

â€œI wish I had distinguished Auntsâ€ said Mortimer.

Rather obviously he hasnt. He is a curious half breed. An Oxford young man, inclined to smartness, dress & culture. His soul is uneasy in Cambridge company. He squirms a little visibly. One is not sure how far one likes him. He flatters. He is not very simple, candid, or talkative, like chatterbox F. who is as open as daylight.

My father is a solicitorâ€”lives at Exmouth, & has really been a bachelor since the death of my mother. She died when I was quite small. No I dont mind being an only child at all. I am quite happy. I never look ahead. If I had two thousand a year, I should never write. I should buy pictures & travel.

We discussed writing novels on Asheham Hill. He had read the Vâ oyage Oâ ut when it came out; & thought it frightfully good. Nâ ight & Dâ ay he couldnâ€™t get through at first, but has now. Jâ acobâ€™â s Râ oom the contemporary novel most to his liking. But he cant write novels himself. Doesnt see why he should; has no originality. Likes pictures perhaps best, because theres Picasso in painting & no one to match him in writing.

â€œPalaeolithic men must have lived here. They lived an extraordinary kind of lifeâ€ we agreed in Asheham Hollow. â€œNow & then the clever ones realised that they were human.â€ At the same time we were talking about Clive Bell who had been to luncheon, talking a great deal. I have a culte for Bloomsbury, said Raymond (we have had to drop titles) â€œHe seems to me a perfectly happy & developed man. He is clever, & he enjoys life too.â€ I said â€œHe has renounced a good deal all the sameâ€”his great book for instance. And his happiness is partly poseâ€. Still, I admitted, heâ€™s a good fellowâ€”heâ€™s done very well. Then Vanessa. â€œShe has such a lovely voice, & then shes very lovely to look at. Her personality too is very impressive,â€ he said. In short â€œYou canâ€™t imagine what it has been to me getting to know Bloomsbury. Theyre different human beings from any I thought possible.â€ Today I have a nice, I think, letter from him. â€œIâ€™d seem gushing if I told you how much I enjoyed my visitâ€¦. Iâ€™m frightfully flattered, & something more than flattered by your friendship, & only hope that when you see through my cleverness, & are thoroughly bored with it, you wonâ€™t be bored with me as wellâ€¦. Anyhow Floreat Bloomsburga!â€

This hits it off very well; my reserves & doubts, his self-consciousness & flattery is it?â€”let us call it â€œenthusiasm.â€

A great deal of time was spent in discussing Nation affairsâ€”the Desmond row; & their position as reviewers. L. is trying to get Bertie & Clive to join in & make the position clear. Undoubtedly the Nation breeds a good many mosquitoes for us. Thereâ€™s Molly this week, refusing to sign her article. And Iâ€™m slightly dashed by the reception of my Conrad conversation, which has been purely negativeâ€”No one has mentioned it. I dont think Mâ ortimer or Bâ irrell quite approved. Never mind; to be dashed is always the most bracing treatment for me. A cold douche should be taken (& generally is) before beginning a book. It invigorates; makes one say â€œOh all right. I write to please myself,â€ & so go ahead. It also has the effect of making me more definite & outspoken in my style, which I imagine all to the good. At any rate, I began for the 5th but last time, I swear, what is now to be called The Common Reader; & did the first page quite moderately well this morning. After all this stew, its odd how, as soon as I begin, a new aspect, never all this 2 or 3 years thought of, at once becomes clear; & gives the whole bundle a new proportion. To curtail, I shall really investigate literature with a view to answering certain questions about ourselvesâ€”Characters are to be merely views: personality must be avoided at all costs. Iâ€™m sure my Conrad adventure taught me this. Directly you specify hair, age, &c something frivolous, or irrelevant, gets into the bookâ€”Dinner!
