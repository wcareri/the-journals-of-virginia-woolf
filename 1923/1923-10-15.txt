Hogarth This last entry seems long ago. And I meant to record for psychological purposes that strange night when I went to meet Leonard & did not meet him. What an intensity of feeling was pressed into those hours! It was a wet windy night; & as I walked back across the field I said Now I am meeting it; now the old devil has once more got his spine through the waves, (but I cannot re-capture really). And such was the strength of my feeling that I became physically rigid. Reality, so I thought, was unveiled. And there was something noble in feeling like this; tragic, not at all petty. Then cold white lights went over the fields; & went out; & I stood under the great trees at Iford waiting for the lights of the bus. And that went by; & I felt lonelier. There was a man with a barrow walking into Lewes, who looked at me. But I could toy with, at least control all this, until suddenly, after the last likely train had come in I felt it was intolerable to sit about, & must do the final thing, which was to go to London. Off I rode, without much time, against such a wind; & again I had a satisfaction in being matched with powerful things, like wind & dark. I battled, had to walk; got on; drove ahead; dropped the torch; picked it up, & so on again without any lights. Saw men & women walking together; thought, youâ€™re safe & happy Iâ€™m an outcast; took my ticket; had 3 minutes to spare, & then, turning the corner of the station stairs, saw Leonard, coming along, bending rather, like a person walking very quick, in his mackintosh. He was rather cold & angry (as, perhaps was natural). And then, not to show my feelings, I went outside & did something to my bicycle. Also, I went back to the ticket office, & said to the humane man there, â€œIts all right. My husband caught the last train. Give me back my fareâ€ which he did. And I got the money more to set myself right with Leonard than because I wanted it. All the way back we talked about a row (about reviewers) at the office; & all the time I was feeling My God, thats over. Iâ€™m out of that. Its over. Really, it was a physical feeling, of lightness & relief & safety. & yet there was too something terrible behind itâ€”the fact of this pain, I suppose; which continued for several daysâ€”I think I should feel it again if I went over that road at night; & it became connected with the deaths of the miners, & with Aubrey Herbertâ€™s death next day. But I have not got it all in, by any means.

We have been dealing with domestic rows; a triumphant solution for us; since Lottie is declared fit for all work by her doctor; but the expense of spirit is too great to be worth while. We lunch on trays. Marjorie does not much like it, but submits. Marjorie has her Champagne love affair with Ralph, now developed into an attack of influenza, as I thought likely. She is a cold honest woman; prepared for the worst. I like her literal good sense, though her spirit does not bounce & spring as one could like. Its her drawl thats the worst of her. And then? My first activity has been to see houses. So far I have seen the outsides of two. And the problem is a difficult one. Its my wish to live in London, no one elses. How far can this wish bear the weight of the removal, the expense, the less pleasant surroundings, & so on? But I shall go on steadily, looking, & I hope, working. Here we are tight wedged in printing & editing. People come (Madge & Janet yesterday for 4 hours, leaving me with a brain like a wrung dish cloth) And we have Dadie in prospect.

This young man with hair like the husk of corn, says he wishes to devote his life to the Hogarth Press, & is writing a letter to that effect to Leonard. This will begin in June. He shall be a partner, & take over the work; & we shall supervise, & by degrees it will become more & more important, & we shall be the benefactors of our age; & have a shop, & enjoy the society of the young, & rummage & splash in the great bran pie, & so never, never stop working with brains or fingers or toes till our limbs fly asunder & the heart sprays off into dust. Such is my fancy pictureâ€”But I must write a careful letter to Frances Cornford & so have no time.

I am now in the thick of the mad scene in Regents Park. I find I write it by clinging as tight to fact as I can, & write perhaps 50 words a morning. This I must re-write some day. I think the design is more remarkable than in any of my books. I daresay I shanâ€™t be able to carry it out. I am stuffed with ideas for it. I feel I can use up everything Iâ€™ve ever thought. Certainly, Iâ€™m less coerced than Iâ€™ve yet been. The doubtful point is I think the character of Mrs Dalloway. It may be too stiff, too glittering & tinselyâ€”But then I can bring innumerable other characters to her support. I wrote the 100th page today. Of course, Iâ€™ve only been feeling my way into itâ€”up till last August anyhow. It took me a yearâ€™s groping to discover what I call my tunnelling process, by which I tell the past by instalments, as I have need of it. This is my prime discovery so far; & the fact that Iâ€™ve been so long finding it, proves, I think, how false Percy Lubbockâ€™s doctrine isâ€”that you can do this sort of thing consciously. One feels about in a state of miseryâ€”indeed I made up my mind one night to abandon the bookâ€”& then one touches the hidden spring. But lorâ€™ love me! Iâ€™ve not re-read my great discovery, & it may be nothing important whatsoever. Never mind. I own I have my hopes for this book. I am going on writing it now till, honestly, I cant write another lineâ€”Journalism, everything, is to give way to it.
