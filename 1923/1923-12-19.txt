### Wednesday 19 December

I dont know if this is my last chance of writing, or if I shall take the black book to Rodmell & fill its last pages there. I am so stifled with work of all sorts, society of all sorts, & plans of all sorts, that I canâ€™t pour a pure stream from my tap. In an hour Sprott & Mary are coming. Merely to count my company since I wrote would take my time & waste it. How elliptical this book becomes! I dont respect events any more: Iâ€™d like to record poor Tomâ€™s getting drunk, all the same. We went to a flat in an arcade, & asked for Captain Eliot. I noticed that his eyes were blurred. He cut the cake meticulously. He helped us to coffeeâ€”or was it tea? Then to liqueurs. He repeated, L. noticed, â€œMrs Ricardoâ€, as L. told his story; he got things a little wrong. There was a long pale squint eyed Oxford youth on the floor. We discussed the personal element in literature. Tom then quietly left the room. L. heard sounds of sickness. After a long time, he came back, sank into the corner, & I saw him, ghastly pale, with his eyes shut, apparently in a stupor. When we left he was only just able to stand on his legs. We heard a shuffling as we went, & Clive went back. Next day, I spent 10 minutes at the telephone receiving apologiesâ€”how distressing, what could we all think? Could we forgive himâ€”the first timeâ€”would we ever come again? no dinner, no lunchâ€”then sudden collapseâ€”how dreadfulâ€”what a miserable end to the eveningâ€”apologise please to Leonard, to your sisterâ€”& so on. One of those comedies which life sometimes does to perfection.

I must briefly touch on Dadie; house problem not settled; Maynard threatening to cut down reviews; Leonard at this moment threatening to resign; Mary & Sprott; Clive & Braithwait, publishing, writing; doing Hardy, & Montaigne & the Greeks & the Elizabethans & the Hours; accepted in America, neglected by all prize givers, very happy, very much on the goâ€”thats my state, at the moment of writing 6.14 p.m. on Wednesday aforesaid.
