### Friday 28 July

These days before going, as we do on Wednesday are too dissipated for serious reading writing living or thinking. Variable as a barometer to phychical changes, my wits flutter & frizzle & I can get no work out of them because, somehow, theyâ€™ve picked up the rumour of a move to Sussex. Indeed, Iâ€™ve been gadding (to parody Iâ€™ve been roaming which we heard at Tancred, Mrs Lytteltonâ€™s intolerably tedious play the other night) gadding too much for the health of my five wits. They soon jangle. Very soon I find myself out of talk, a disillusioned spectator, for instance, of Clive, Mary & Mortimer, of Maryâ€™s great evening party, of old Roger & old Margery, of Tidmarsh with young kitten Rylands verging on the albino. However, Iâ€™ve enjoyed it too, in its rather agitating way, this half year has kept me on the hop. I like that; agitating though it is. Iâ€™ve taken my fences, as I say, & got some good gallops for my trouble. I have also to remind myself that risks imply falls. There are incidents that disquiet me. I have been peevish, exacting, excited, & moody. In these general terms I refer to a certain degree of society: to something stirring us to live more stormily than last year I think. Never settle, is my principle in life: & I try to put it in practice, but in talk more than in action I daresay. My theory is that at 40 one either increases the pace or slows down. Needless to say which I desire. But, to be just, my activity is also mental. Iâ€™m working variously & with intention. Iâ€™ve pulled through my Chaucer chapter; & written ahead at The Hours, & fill in spare space with â€˜seriousâ€™ reading for my book, reading with pen & notebook. It encourages me to feel that all this reading has an end in view. In five years, I shall have fagged out a good book from it, I hope; a rough, but vigorous statue testifying before I die to the great fun & pleasure my habit of reading has given me. And Iâ€™m going to work hard, hard, hard, in every sense at Rodmell. I am going to tackle those old essays of mine, & see whether by drastic & spirited treatment they can be made worth reprinting. Courage & decision are my need, I thinkâ€”to speak out, without mincing. At the moment I feel myself farely free of foreign influence: Eliot, or whoever it might be: & this I must prize, for unless I am myself, I am nobody.

As for the press, we have finished Tom, much to our relief. He will be published this August by Marjorie; & altogether we have worked at full speed since May. & that is Iâ€™m persuaded the root & source & origin of all health & happiness, provided of course that one rides work as a man rides a great horse, in a spirited & independent way; not a drudge, but a man with spurs in his heels. So I donâ€™t force myself any more to read against my will. Iâ€™m grown epicure in my middle age. Nevertheless, some compulsion is needed for the Greek chapter, which I must investigate at Rodmell. Also I shall exploreâ€”take a motor bus ride along the downs one dayâ€”see Steyning, & Arundel & so on. I much regret not having seen Windsor this spring. But I have at least ordered my French grammar. For plans, I have immediately to write a dialogue on Conrad: so must read for that too. Fame? Is not Clive writing an article on me? Has not Bunny praised me in the Dial? Does not Madame LogÃ© propose to translate The Voyage Out?â€”But fame â€œcomes slowly up this wayâ€. I am never praised except by my contemporaries or youngers. When Wells picks young writers, he neglects me. There are many other matters of importance to discuss at Rodmell though: the Nation; L.â€™s work; Hogarth House. Nessa last night, sitting in the Square, recommended Haverstock Hill.
