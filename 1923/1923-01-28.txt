### Sunday 28 January

A certain melancholy has been brooding over me this fortnight. I date it from Katherineâ€™s death. The feeling so often comes to me nowâ€”Yes. Go on writing of course: but into emptiness. Thereâ€™s no competitor. Iâ€™m cockâ€”a lonely cock whose crowing nothing breaksâ€”of my walk. For our friendship had so much that was writing in it. However then I had my fever, & violent cold, was in & out of bed for a week, & still am below normal, I think. In casting accounts, never forget to begin with the state of the body.

K., so Ralph reports via Brett, died in 10 minutes of haemorrhage, walking upstairs with Murry who happened to be there. Brett is â€˜very hard hitâ€™ Ralph says. I soon shant have Ralphâ€™s sayings to report. Does that make me melancholy? Like most of oneâ€™s feelings mine on losing him are mixed. We now have had Joad twiceâ€”Margery I should & do call her, & she comes tomorrow full time. She has a little too much powder & scent for my taste, & drawls. In short she is not upper class. But she has honest intent eyes, & takes it seriously, which, as she is quite without training, is as well. My only fear is lest she should prove a flibbertigibbet. Her quickness of movement, keenness, & dependability are so far a great gain on Ralph. There he sits thick as an oak & as angular. We have heard no more of the Tidmarsh Press.

I have seen quantities of peopleâ€”having them here, as my invalid ways induced, bright pictures, tunes on the gramophoneâ€”but I must not insult the human soul for which I have really so much respect. Bobo & Betty have nothing sharp or bright about them. Both seem to dissolve in a November cloud; depressed, emotional, with no target for emotion. Bobo is vaguely indulging in an affairâ€”perhaps with a medical student called Stanleyâ€”(she does not confide names). He takes her out, makes love, which she enjoys but finds somehow inferior. She likes the surroundings. She had been out with him somewhere, the night before, & said the surroundings were glittering. She yielded to the unreality; then repented, & told him this was the last time. Then she repents of that, forages in her pocket for principles, forages in mine, & I, not knowing her case, advised her to fling herself into life, to reflect, but not to withdraw, which of course pointed the way she secretly wished, & yet privately feels impure. So do I in this case.

Betty had not even any case to put before me. Never was there a limper, less objective, creature. There she lounges in the arm chair opposite, never thinking she need speak, or invent, or comment or do any of the tricks which human beings have devised for keeping the water fresh. One stagnates kindly, gently. She is a nice girl, by which I mean gentle & affectionate, but also clinging & selfish & egotistical. She says dress is a great snare. She says she lives with rotten people. She says she means to go abroad & learn singing. Meanwhile she has taken a flat in the Queenâ€™s Road, so far from her haunts that she must lunch out, & spends hours daily wandering the streets, looking in at shop windows I suppose & coveting dresses.

Who else? Roger & Bob: Bob with his lid on, not talking but bubbling underneath. He had to be kept under or would have foamed all over us. Much talk of the Nation, wh, as I should have recorded, is sold to Maynard & a group, & our future once more quite uncertain. Still I cant fabricate doubts, & hereby record my expectation that we shall emerge richer in 2 months time. Massingham will start a new paper: Maynard will retain Leonard at a handsome fee. And then? (I race, before dinner comes.) Rogerâ€™s lecture, the last. Before it I dined with Noel Olivier (Richards) at the Club. She looked at me with those strange eyes in which a drop seems to have been spiltâ€”a pale blue drop, with a large deep centreâ€”romantic eyes, that seem to behold still Rupert bathing in the river at Christow: eyes pure & wide, & profound it seems. Or is there nothing behind them? I as good as asked her. Why didnâ€™t you marry any of those romantic young men? Why? Why? She didnâ€™t know, said she had moods; all Oliviers are mad she said. And Rupert had gone with Cathleen Nesbitt & she had been jealous, & he had spoken against women & gone among the Asquiths & changed. But when she read his love lettersâ€”beautiful beautiful love lettersâ€”real love letters, she saidâ€”she cries & cries. How direct & unyielding these young women are. But she is â€œover 30â€â€”she would not say how much. & I am 41: which I confess. So we parted.

Then?â€”Morgan, buttoned like a hairdresser, cheerful, communicative, but come to talk business & soon gone.

Then Lilian, with her hands in her lap, facing old age, & horribly bored. The egotismâ€”gentle & blood suckingâ€”of these elderly women! She wanted work, advice, & the names of Inns. I was amused to detect her complete absorption in Margaret; her childlike record of every symptom meal & habit. But this is natural, indeed charming & pathetic too.
