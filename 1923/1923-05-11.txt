### Friday 11 May

The long break deserves a line, since I shall scarcely commemorate it otherwise. Have I not with infinite labour, written for the first number of the Nation To Spain? Am I not sitting waiting for L. to â€˜come back from the officeâ€™ like other wives. It annoys me to be like other wives. Ah there he is! No: damn it; only Nelly gone out. As I say, I cannot go into the journey, the Temples, Brenan, Spain, Paris, et cetera. I stayed in Paris by way of facing life. Yes, I clap the spurs to my flanks & see myself taking fences gallantly. I â€˜took Jane & Hope; not much else, save the French language, at which I failed ignominiously, & now must learn to speak French if I am in future to respect myself. I meant to use this diary to pull myself up from a fortnights debauch of journalism, Nations affairs, & so on. I must make out a work scheme. But for a moment I will dally with description. Margery is doing well, a sign of which is that we now scarcely notice her accent. If she were doing badly it would grate upon us intolerably. We are well up in our books.

Morgan dined here the other night. We tried to cajole him to write with Â£10 p. 1,000 for bait. â€œBut I dont want Â£200 a yearâ€ he said. â€œI daresay I could spend it if I had it, but I donâ€™t want it.â€ So what vice could we appeal to? Vanity was not much touched. Then he has an ascetic regard for principles. People he respects think that Mâ assingham was badly treated. At any rate, Morgan wd. not like to write for us, & not for Desmond, who pays Â£4 instead of Â£10. He is detached as a saint. And we couldnt press him. So far, we donâ€™t feel the Nation blood of our blood. It may turn that way. We work very hard at it. It has temptations & attractions. How they balance the drawbacks I donâ€™t yet know. I like having the pick of new books. My own authority over the reviewing staff is not very exciting. I am a little malicious perhaps. People crowd & crush & press for work. It is mildly amusing to say, now donâ€™t worry, Iâ€™m not going to give you any. I have been so often in their position. But these delights are not very profound. Iâ€™m afraid it looks as though Reading must again be shelved. I canâ€™t afford not to make hay just now. One article a month paid at Â£15 or so. And that precisely uses the time I had to spend from writing my novel. Yet, to take up my work account, I think I must edge in a little time every now & then at Reading. I am at the Greek chapter (in reading). Shall I read a little Greek? My notion is that I can only sketch the chapter, & must perpetually enrich it from time to time. Or shall I plunge into early Elizabethans, of whom I am appallingly ignorant? What happened between Chaucer & Shakespeare? I think that attracts me as a basis. Make notes then; &, directly opportunity offers, dash in at the Pastons & Chaucer. One might read Troilus & Cressida; but I dont feel inclined.
