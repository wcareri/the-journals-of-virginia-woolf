### Tuesday 2 January

If I were a dissembler I should date this the last day of 1922. So it is to all intents. We came back from Rodmell yesterday, & I am in one of my moods, as the nurses used to call it, today. And what is it & why? A desire for children, I suppose; for Nessaâ€™s life; for the sense of flowers breaking all round me involuntarily. Hereâ€™s Angelicaâ€”hereâ€™s Quentin & Julian. Now children dont make yourself ill on plum pudding tonight. We have people dining. Thereâ€™s no hot water. The gas is escaping in Quentinâ€™s bedroomâ€”I pluck what I call flowers at random. They make my life seem a little bare sometimes; & then my inveterate romanticism suggests an image of forging ahead, alone, through the night: of suffering inwardly, stoically; of blazing my way through to the endâ€”& so forth. The truth is that the sails flap about me for a day or two on coming back; & not being at full stretch I ponder & loiter. And it is all temporary: yet let me be quite clear about that. Let me have one confessional where I need not boast. Years & years ago, after the Lytton affair, I said to myself, walking up the hill at Beireuth, never pretend that the things you havenâ€™t got are not worth having; good advice I think. At least it often comes back to me. Never pretend that children, for instance, can be replaced by other things. And then I went on (the thought is always connected with Mrs Freshfieldâ€”why?) to say to myself that one must (put all oneâ€™s weight upon) (how am I to convey it?) like things for themselves: or rather, rid them of their bearing upon oneâ€™s personal life. One must throw that aside; & venture on to the things that exist independently of oneself. Now this is very hard for young women to do. Yet I got satisfaction from it. And now, married to L., I never have to make the effort. I do it, if I enjoy doing it. Perhaps I have been too happy for my soulâ€™s good? Perhaps I have become cowardly & self-indulgent? And does some of my discontent come from feeling that? I could not stay at 46 last night, because L. on the telephone expressed displeasure. Late again. Very foolish. Your heart badâ€”& so my self reliance being sapped, I had no courage to venture against his will. Then I react. Of course its a difficult question. For undoubtedly I get headaches or the jump in my heart; & then this spoils his pleasure, & if one lives with a person, has one the rightâ€”So it goes on. And I will try to make up my accounts on the spiritual side before attacking the temporal, only, as usual, jerkily, disconnectedly, & without more than the sort of tap a chemist might give to the jars in his shop, naming them shortly, because he knows what is in them. At fifty, when I re-read, perhaps I shall know what I meant.

Middle Age then. Let that be the text of my discourse. Iâ€™m afraid weâ€™re becoming elderly. We are busy & attach importance to hours. I have my correspondence to finish, says L. today. I donâ€™t laugh. I take it seriously. But we must not let our hobbies & pleasures become objects of fetish worship. L., I think, suffers from his extreme clarity. He sees things so clear that he canâ€™t swim float & speculate. And now we have such a train attached to us that we have to go on. It is easy, at least, to pretend that pressure is upon us. Nessa, though, who might so easily plead ties & circumstances, rides much more freely than we do. She will spend Easter travelling with the children, for instance. We have to make moneyâ€”that is true. We have to have a house; 2 houses; 2 servants; a press; a Tomson; a Ralph. Yet most of this is for my sake; & am I honest in wishing it otherwise? Dont I feel (mainly) that I must ease the strain of circumstances in order to write?â€”that interruptions bore me: put gross matter in my fire?

I will leave it here, unfinished, a note of interrogationâ€”signifying some mood that recurs, but is not often expressed. Oneâ€™s life is made up, superficially, of such moods; but they cross a solid substance, which too I am not going to hack my way into now.

So this is the end of 1922.
