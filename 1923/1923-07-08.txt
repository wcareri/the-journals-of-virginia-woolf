### Saturday 8 July

So we went to dine with the Myers; & it is now the hottest day of the year. & I donâ€™t want to grumble; having seen many peopleâ€”Anyhow, if a move is to be made, it canâ€™t be till the autumn, or new year. Anyhow I am content at present, or moderately so. I am alive; rather energetic; asked to write for 2 American papers, & so on & so on. I never said that Vanity Fair has invited me & the Dial & new Broom as well as the Nation & the Times, so that I canâ€™t help thinking myself about as successful journalistically as any woman of my day. But that is not saying much. I wish I could write The Hours as freely & vigorously as I scribble Freshwater, a Comedy. Its a strange thing how arduous I find my novels; & yet Freshwater is only spirited fun; & The Hours has some serious merit. I should like though to get speed & life into it. I got tempted, a week ago, into comedy writing, & have scribbâ led daily, & trust it will be done tomorrow. Yet I feel some reluctance to screw myself to The Hours again. Never mind. Should it bore me, into the fire with it!

The very thought of a fire is uncomfortable. I have said nothing about the weather for ages. How May & June melted into thin cold cloud. They were plucked from the year. By the way, on re-reading this book I resolved to write rather more carefully, & to record conversations verbatim. It is difficult to write carefully, as I am always having at this book by way of killing time, filling time, or writing out the fidgets. As for recording conversations, nothing is harder. Let me try.

Desmond: I canâ€™t stay to dinner. No I must get back to my mother. Sheâ€™s become quite an old woman. She was thrown 10 yards by the cab, & though no bones were broken, she has lost her memory. She tells the same story over again. She never stops talking about her accident. I am taking her down to the Isle of Wight.

Enter Janet: I was determined to comeâ€”

Virginia: And is the Forest very lovely?

Desmond: All the oaks are being devoured by caterpillars. Yes, you can hear a pattering sound beneath the trees. That is the caterpillars munching. And if they eat a tree for 3 years, it is dead.

Janet: O how dreadful! I do hope that hasnâ€™t happened to our oak trees.

Leonard: Well, Desmond have we settled our quarrel.

V.: (explaining to Janet) Theyre rivalâ€™s you see. Desmond edits the New Statesman. They steal each others reviewers.

Leonard: Desmond steals my reviewers.

Desmond: Oh, the quarrelâ€™s all made upâ€”I say who have you got this week:

L.: Bertie & Graves.

Desmond: Oh thats all right. My Bertie comes next week. So some gossip about the Nation.

Desmond: Have you read the second number of the Adelphi? Have you read Murry â€œI have been a miserable sinner (acting & striking his breast). I have lied, I have swindled. I have laughed at what I love; but now I am speaking the truth.â€ Heâ€™s like a revivalist preacher. I saw Sullivan last week end. He says he doesnâ€™t agree with Murry. Hes not one of the push. He says you couldnâ€™t think him sincere if you only judged him by this evidence. But he says he is sincere.

Le.: Its John Bull over again. â€œIf every reader will get another readerâ€â€”& that on top of his revelations about Katherineâ€™s death!

V.: I dont object to opening the heart, but I do object to finding it empty. Murry has nothing whatever to reveal. Yet he has sold his reticence.

Janet: Dear dear, dear dear! He talks about his wifeâ€™s death? Dear, dear.

Desmond: Mortimer has done Katherine this week. But heâ€™s not got to the bottom of her. Nor did I.

V.: I say Desmond, whatever the reason may be, the Hawk gets daily better & better. Its never been so good. People talk about the Hawk: about reading the paper for the Hawk.

Des: Oh come Virginia, it wasnâ€™t as bad as all that before! more gossip between Desmond & Leonard.

Janet: (to me)
