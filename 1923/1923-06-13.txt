### Wednesday 13 June

Nessa is back & the London season of course in full swing. So I judged yesterday in the Aeolian Hall, listening, in a dazed way, to Edith Sitwell vociferating through the megaphone. There was Lady Colefax in her hat with the green ribbons. Did I say that I lunched with her last week? That was Derby Day & it rained, & all the light was brown & cold, & she went on talking talking, in consecutive sentences like the shavings that come from planes, artificial, but unbroken. It was not a successful party, Clive & Lytton & me. For Cliveâ€™s back; & he dined here with Leo Myers the other night; & then I went to Golders Green & sat with Mary Sheepshanks in her garden, & beat up the waters of talk, as I do so courageously, so that life maynâ€™t be wasted. The fresh breeze went brushing all the thick hedges which divide the gardens. Somehow, extraordinary emotions possessed me. I forget now what. Often now I have to control my excitementâ€”as if I were pushing through a screen; or as if something beat fiercely close to me. What this portends I donâ€™t know. It is a general sense of the poetry of existence that overcomes me. Often it is connected with the sea & St Ives. Going to 46 continues to excite. Dear old Nessa returned shabby, loose, easy; & 44, so she said. The sight of 2 coffins in the Underground luggage office I daresay constricts all my feelings. I have the sense of the flight of time; & this shores up my emotions. N. & I sat talking, both now well known women, if it comes to that. At dinner we discussed what school Quentin should go to. â€œHe means to be a painterâ€, said Nessa. â€œYesâ€ said Quentin, as if he were saying â€œyes, I am in love.â€ At least it made me feel queer.

Nothing else of great importance has happened. I should be describing Edith Sitwellâ€™s poems, but I kept saying to myself â€œI dont really understandâ€”I dont really admire.â€ The only view, presentable view that I framed, was to the effect that she was monotonous. She has one tune only on her merry go round. And she makes her verse keep step accurately to the Hornpipe. This seems to be wrong; but Iâ€™m all sandy with writing criticism, & must be off to my book again. Leo Myers, who is glazed with disillusionment & middle age, as tongues are glazed, said that my turn & turn about method is wrong. The Drs say so. He goes in for this kind of frigid examination of things. He has no impulses, nothing to do. He goes out every night everywhere. Clive & he capped stories of the demi-monde. Next day Clive rang up & said he had been ashamed. I fancy Clive is trying to take in a reef or two in his white waistcoat of dissipation. And as usual I wantâ€”I wantâ€”But what do I want? Whatever I had, I should always say I want, I want. Yet it comes over me that to sit on the grass at the Horse Show tomorrow with L. will be very contenting. But then I want to go to the Opera. Leo Myers said we all feel excluded. Yet he has 8,000 a year, tax free, 2 houses, 2 children, 1 motor car. We try to impress each other, he said; & had told me of a journey to Cherbourg for this purpose. True, I was deeply impressed. I said to myself he crossed in the Aquitania: then he was quite free to go anywhere he liked. His life was full of romance. And it was I who got the romance by thinking this, not poor Leo, who is glazed like a tongue.

For the rest, I should be writing to Mrs Eliot. & will, now, directly, on the instant. I say nothing about Duncanâ€™s show: about Mollie Hamilton or Henderson who dined last night, or Bob.
