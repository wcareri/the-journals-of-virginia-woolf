### Tuesday 6 March

Undoubtedly this has been a very unpleasant quarter. I date our misery from Jan. 3rd. The main grievance has been this Nation affair, which hangs over us, lifting, then lowering, as it is at the present momentâ€”low & black over our heads. Massm. goes on April 7th: our income ceases; Maynard has made us no definite offerâ€”but that I think is assured so far as L. goes. But that is only Â£120 p.a. & we shall have to scrape up the rest rather dismally, doing journalism, I suppose. Msm. is now said to be waiting for the return of a gentleman in the East, who will he is certain finance him. The scheme is off till October anyhow. But its not the money trouble that worries us: but something psychological. The gloom is more on L.â€™s side than on mine. Mine is a gloom like a mist that comes & goes. One is unsettled. I dip into different circlesâ€”like Maryâ€™s, E. Sandsâ€™, the Richmondsâ€™ concert, & come home either exalted or depressed. My chairs look dirty. Then the social question rises between L. & me. Are we becoming â€˜respectableâ€™? Shall we dine with the Richmonds. L. says no. I regret it. Yes, some how I regret it seriously, this shutting of the door upon suburban studies. I love the chatter & excitement of other peoples houses. Have I not just said that it depresses me too? But then I wanted to meet Percy Lubbock & show myself off as a woman who can talk sense. & so on. I ask people here too often. In short I must take the social side into my own hands. I have, I think, got Reading on its feet, & hope to make way, & find my solace in that. But still I want to make life fuller & fuller.

Poor Katherine has taken to revisiting the earth; she has been seen at Brettâ€™s; by the charwoman. I feel this somehow a kind of judgment on her for writing the kind of thing she did. Brett told me the story the other day & seemed so bare & rasped that I could not have taken this comfort from her had I wished. Nor do I wish, seriously, to obstruct any decent investigation of brains & nerves, seeing how much Iâ€™ve suffered that way myself. But then Brett is not scientific; she at once takes the old fables seriously, & repeats some jargon learnt of Dunning, but no doubt diluted in transit, about day & night, birth, & therefore death, all being beautiful. She feels the â€˜contactâ€™ she says; & has had revelations; & there she sits deaf, injured, solitary, brooding over death, & hearing voices, which soon will become, I expect, entirely fabulous; & even now talking to her has a good deal robbed the image of K.M. of its distinctness. For it came distinctly back when I read her letters. And I saw her wink when poor Brettâ€™s note was handed in, & she said that little person can wait, or something like that. Now B. idolises her, & invests her with every quality of mind & soul. Do people always get what they deserve, & did K.M. do something to deserve this cheap posthumous life? & am I jealous even now?

No: I think one can be honest at my age.  
Old Elena crossed the room to talk to me on Sunday. Oh how shy I was! How matronly & magnificent in a thick rich black way she was! & we couldnâ€™t look each other in the eyesâ€”at least I couldnâ€™t; & she felt me shabby, self-conscious, suburban no doubt. I am putting down notes to use later in re-constructing this period. There is, I think, a sense of frustration & futility about just now. Partly the Nation again, Iâ€™ve no doubt, partlyâ€¦. Never mind, I say; once get my claws into my writing & Iâ€™m safe. Eliot slightly disillusions me too; he is peevish, plaintive, egotistical; what it amounts to is that poverty is unbecoming. He nibbles at cherries. True, the offer, to co-operate with Royde Smith, is a wizened cherry. But he elaborates & complicates, makes one feel that he dreads life as a cat dreads water. But if I hint so much he is all claws. Now, considering my activity on his behalf no doubt I have some of the vile & patronising feelings of the benefactor. Its American, L. says; that & neurotic. I consulted Bruce Richmondâ€”another proof of my importance. He said emphatically â€œHeâ€™s not the man for the job.â€ I canâ€™t help agreeing.

But life, life! How I long to take you in my arms & crush you out!
