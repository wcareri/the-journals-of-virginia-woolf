### Tuesday 17 July

I forget now, it being Tuesday 17th July what Janet said. It was a hot day, I remember. Let me try another conversation. But there have been so many. Shall we attempt old Birrell the other night? Persons: Aug. Birrell: Francis B. Tony B.Â L. & V.

Scene 70 Elm Park Road: first dark pannelled dining room; later the library, a room just beneath the grass of a large garden. Books all round; regular, back to back books in series & editions. Framed autographs on walls. One from Lamb. â€œMary has got to leave meâ€”She is going to be ill. Tell Forster.â€

A.: Birrell Oh, thats dreadful.

He is a large fine untidy old man, in blue shirt, grey hair, no tie. Very vigorous & manly in the Victorian style.

I went to hear Dickens read at Liverpool (he gave away prizes). He had to name a girl called Wellerâ€”Miss Weller, he said: & I assure you there were Bishops, Mayors, Judgesâ€”every sort of personâ€”& they roared with laughter. No other human being could have done that by just mentioning one of his own characters. You would have taken him for an actorâ€”or a seafaring man. He had a blue coat; & a great necktie.â€”a wonderful looking man.

V.: (obediently, filially) And Thackeray, did you know?

A.B.: No, never saw him.

V.: (â€ â€) You should write your memoirs.

A.B.: Good gracious no.

F.B.: I can read all biographiesâ€”all childhoods anyhow.

A.B.: (somehow got on to the Harmsworths). I knew Alfred, the fatherâ€”an old Bailey Barristerâ€”a nice chap, who may have drunk a little too muchâ€”may have. Well he was Vice President of a Club wh. met up at St Johns Wood, the Eyre Arms, I think, called what was it? The Sylvan, because they met in a woodâ€”& I went sometimes & we debatedâ€”all young fellows. One night walking on the Embankment I met Alfred, very down on his luck he was. Iâ€™m going to die he said, & Iâ€™ve done nothing. Iâ€™m leaving my wife, & six children (I think he said) & Iâ€™ve done nothing. Well, I had an inspiration. My dear chap, I said, youâ€™ve done the only thing you could do, & dont you worry, I said. Take my word for it, one of those boysâ€™ll do well. Theyâ€™ll look after their mother, I said; & so we parted. He died in a fortnight. And sure enough, the great Alfred got going, & made a fortune ever so soon, & every penny went to the old lady. One night I was splashed with mud from head to foot in Piccadilly, & there was the old lady, sitting in her barouche, furs on her knee, two horses, driving off to Berkely Street. Always his mother came first. When I knew them there was a smell of cold mutton & boots all over the house. But I saw what a remarkable woman she was. She controlled everything. And now sheâ€™s still alive, & Lady Nth. has married my old friend Hudson.

(Somehow we got on to Hardyâ€™s novels; how he makes a woman confess sheâ€™s had a bastard on her wedding night; upon wh. the husband packs his bag & goes to the South Seas).

A.B.: vehementlyâ€”Youâ€™re all children. You dont know what your talking about. Iâ€™d have done the same. Iâ€™d have packed my bag anyhow. Silly woman! She should have told him in the cornfieldâ€”It was a silly disgusting thing to do. Its not a question of morality. Morality dont change. Its human nature.

F.B.: My dear old Pater youâ€™re talking nonsense. (They were very affectionate: Francis helping him to address Lady Wimbomeâ€™s telegram correctly, which I donâ€™t think he could have done without).

V.: Tennyson is a great poet.

A.B.: Certainly heâ€™s a poet, not a great poet. Hallam was a donkey. Shall never forget his telegram to Eleanor: Passed away peacefully at 3.45. Liked Austinâ€™s book. Hallam carried his mother on his back. It was thought so beautiful. So he never had a profession & didnâ€™t want one. He was a lazy man. Tennyson was a very direct creatureâ€”didnâ€™t like second marriages, didnâ€™t like Lionelâ€™s dying at seaâ€”no sod to visitâ€”very old fashioned, conventional views.

(Told the story of Ellen Terry running round the bedroom naked, & Watts going to Harcourt & saying â€œIt frightened me.â€ â€œIt wouldnâ€™t have frightened meâ€ said Harcourt, very loud & bluff.) Tony Birrell in a high shrill falling voice, he squints rather, is pale, wears spectacles, & suddenly disappears to range about the garden alone.

I had a letter from Hester the other day. She was coming here, but the motor car broke down!! (as if this were a surprising piece of news).

F.B.: Tony, you look after the drinks donâ€™t you. Tony goes & fidgets at the sideboard. In the end A.B. gave me Boswellâ€™s Corsica, & wrote â€œto Victoria Woolfâ€¦â€ then wrote to apologise. An interesting evening, highly Victorian, well furnished with drink & cigars & carpets & leather chairs. Old B. is a storyteller, & has had his day: been a figure in society, yet remains non conformist; not, I think, a very serious writer, but a good Victorian all round humane literary type, sunned by various kinds of life, as we arenâ€™t nowâ€”barrister, politician, essayist. He is anxious to write for L.

Persons: Vivien Eliot, Torn; Sunday tea.

Tom. Put brandy in your tea, Vivien.

No, no, Tom.

Yes. You must put a tea spoonful of brandy in your tea.

Vivien.: Oh all rightâ€”I donâ€™t want it.

V.: One doesnâ€™t like taking medicine before oneâ€™s friends.

L.: What about the great questionâ€”the Adelphi? Whats to be said?

Vvn: What indeed? (sheâ€™s very nervous, very spotty, much powdered, her first drive, overdressed, perhaps.)

Tom: I have put a note in the Criterion. I donâ€™t understand this business about Wells & lifeâ€”this confusion that literature is not life.

V.: Shall you write.

Tom.: Oh dear no. Murry is now comfortable for the first time. Heâ€™s in the society he likes.

Vivien: Iâ€™m living between him & Mr Joyce. Mr Joyce is very nice.

Tom: His wife is very nice tooâ€”& the children. Giorgio is away in la Banque Generale (he pronounces French always with great care & pride).

V.: Iâ€™ve been setting up your poem. Its a good poem.

Vivien: a damned good poem, did you say?

V.: Well, youâ€™ve improved what I said. But it is a dâ€”â€”d good poem.

Cetera disunt.

My impression being that they were nervous, contrasted us with them, & liked us & our surroundings. And on the drive home, I daresay Vivien said â€œWhy canâ€™t we get on as the Woolves do?â€ I think they meant us to feel them in sympathy together. Certainly they were lighter, more affectionate.
