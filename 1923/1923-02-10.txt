The omens are, I think, more favourable. Maynard has presented an ultimatum, to the effect I think, but this was gathered on the telephone, that he will not work with Ramsay Muir. For my own part, what with this & that, I think it fairly certain that Massinghamâ€™s side will now prevail, in some form or other, since even if the Rowntrees are raging as red oxen, they must be open eyed enough to see that they canâ€™t safely deposit their trust in the Wee Frees minus Maynard. Then we have Â£40 from income tax returnâ€”I seem to see a feather floating favourably from that region where the Gods abide. So I said as we walked in the cemetery this afternoon. A charwoman was planting hyacinths on a wet grave. She was all wet grey wool; dull, drab, like a jackal; & I prowled too among the graves to look at names, & ascertain who could be deserving of several tons of granite crucifixâ€”the Belgian soldiers, so it turned out. On we walk again. The spring the spring, I sing in imitation of Wagner, & saw a gorze bush set with soft yellow buds. Then we got into the Park, where the rain drove dogs & humans home, & so back, on the stroke of three. It is now our plan (a day old) to walk from 2 to 3; print from 3 to 5; delay our tea; & so make headway. In fact I set up a little of Read. Morgan is finished, save for one last printing off. Ralph sticks on, defiant, argumentative, & gives one the lowest opinion of the manly virtues.

Is Mary an example of the womanly? She may be a good actress. She had a long talk with me two days ago, in the dusk, over the fire. The upshot of it is to my mind a little complex: does Vanessa misrepresent her? I donâ€™t accuse her of brilliance & wit. But I think I detect a humbler spirit than I expected; she is, she said, shy. And she never likes the people who like her, but attaches herself in spite of all snubs to those she likes. This refers to 46. She has a temper. She flies out. She would like to live with people in numbersâ€”not merely see them. (I thought this sincere). She might be one of those impulsive, affectionate, rather unfortunately concocted natures who are to me interesting, perpetually venturing out, rashly importunate, & then snubbed back again; aspiring; fastidious, vain & so on, but impelled by a kind of passion, for Clive, I suppose, which is sincere. Then of course I rate a womans sensibility & sympathy very high, as pleasure givers that is. Nor is she uncritical: far from it. Didnâ€™t she tell me she could think me lovable if my desire for admiration about everything were not so insatiable? No, I said, I only want on most points to be assured that Iâ€™m of the average human stature. I have my astonishing twists & kinks, as you do. For I couldnâ€™t imagine you shy. Yet you say you can hardly brace yourself to enter the Ritz!â€”your triumphal path, I should have said. And is she really tremulous? a far more instinctive nature than mine or Nessaâ€™s & therefore one we are likely to misjudge. Nothing new, she said, would ever happen to her again. She loves pleasure, I note; & though she neither writes nor paints looks forward to the summer. One will get the blinds out, she said. But I suppose I talked most, & about myself. How Iâ€™d been depressed since Jan. 3rd. We ran it to earth, I think, by discovering that I began journalism on that day. Last Thursday, I think, I returned to fiction, to the instant nourishment & well being of my entire day. I wonder if this next lap will be influenced by Proust? I think his French language, tradition, &c, prevents that: yet his command of every resource is so extravagant that one can hardly fail to profit, & must not flinch, through cowardice.
