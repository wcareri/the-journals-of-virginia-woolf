### Saturday 29 August

Iâ€™ve been battling for ever so long with â€˜The Hoursâ€™, which is proving one of my most tantalising & refractory of books. Parts are so bad, parts so good; Iâ€™m much interested; canâ€™t stop making it up yetâ€”yet. What is the matter with it? But I want to freshen myself, not deaden myself, so will say no more. Only I must note this odd symptom; a conviction that I shall go on, see it through, because it interests me to write it.

Clive & Mary came. So did Nick Bagenal; so did Mrs Jones; & we went to Seaford too. An odd instinct informed me that Mr Jones was non-existent. Who then could Hugh be? He is the child of Philip Morrell! So that puzzle has fitted itself together oddly enough. Mrs J. is too self-conscious to be a widow. She has no past to deploreâ€”an uneasy future, under my eye. The little boy has strange blue eyesâ€”but no look of the old ram. Nickâ€™s attachment to Barbara is very marked. By virtue of her astounding merits he is admitted among the great, in whom he still believes. He brought several pears & a melon. This melon, Molly Hamilton ate. She was windblown & breathless. She is tart, not embittered. She is brave; has herself in hand. Faces more facts every night than I do in a year. Of course her touch is not sensitive; vigorous rather, &, as I say, she licks the gilt off any scrap of gingerbread. I notice this in her descriptions. She never seems to enjoy people completely. But she admires me. I was â€˜niceâ€™ to her indeed; quite simple, quite unaffected, made no attempt to impose myself. But then, I thought, perhaps it is more amusing to be brilliant. One cannot condemn it utterly. It carries further.

Clive has an eggâ€”a turkeys eggâ€”for a head nowâ€”quite bald, unashamedly bald; never a hair will grow any more. Mary was shrinking, childlike, not brilliant, not attending when I read my play, but very anxious to say the right thing. She worships her canary. She pressed me to write about him. What view would I takeâ€”about this last phase, for instance, the Byronic? Chocolates she brought; she wore tight grey Alpaca, with large buttons, & she powdered & re-powdered in the drawing room. I cannot write out any verbatim talk; but will try again. Going to the dogs was discussed:
