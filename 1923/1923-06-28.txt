This may be life; but I doubt that I shall ever convert L. & now sit down baffled & depressed to face a life spent, mute & mitigated, in the suburbs, just as I had it in mind that I could at last go full speed ahead. For the capacities in me will never after 40, accumulate again. And I mind missing life far more than he does, for it isnâ€™t life to him in the sense that it is life to me. Oh to be able to slip in & out of things easily, to be in them, not on the verge of themâ€”I resent this effort & waste. My evening is now wasted because Iâ€™m dining with the Myers. But what should be my course now? Really, I think, to find out exactly how much I mean by this. But half the horror is that L. instead of being, as I gathered, sympathetic has the old rigid obstacleâ€”my health. And I cant sacrifice his peace of mind, yet the obstacle is surely now a dead hand, which one should no longer let dominate our short years of lifeâ€”oh to dwindle them out here, with all these gaps, & abbreviations! Always to catch trains, always to waste time, to sit here & wait for Leonard to come in, to spend hours standing at the box of type with Margery, to wonder what its all forâ€”when, alternatively, I might go & hear a tune, or have a look at a picture, or find out something at the British Museum, or go adventuring among human beings. Sometimes I should merely walk down Cheapside. But now Iâ€™m tied, imprisoned, inhibited. All I can do is to pretend Iâ€™m writing something very important, or reading with a view to a book I shall never write. (Iâ€™m letting my pen fling itself on paper like a leopard starved for bloodâ€”& I must wash & dressâ€”so do not, in years to come, look too harshly upon this first outcry, the expression of many yet unheard). This is the pith of my complaint. For ever to be suburban. L. I donâ€™t think minds any of this as much as I do. But then, Lord! (not Lord in K.M.â€™s serious sense) what I owe to him! What he gives me! Still, I say, surely we could get more from life than we doâ€”isnâ€™t he too much of a Puritan, of a disciplinarian, doesnâ€™t he through birth & training accept a drastic discipline too tamely, or rather, with too Spartan a self control? There is, I suppose, a very different element in us; my social side, his intellectual side. This social side is very genuine in me. Nor do I think it reprehensible. It is a piece of jewellery I inherit from my motherâ€”a joy in laughter, something that is stimulated, not selfishly wholly or vainly, by contact with my friends. And then ideas leap in me. Moreover, for my work now, I want freer intercourse, wider intercourseâ€”& now, at 41, having done a little work, I get my wages partly in invitations. I might know people. In Richmond this is impossible. Either we have arduous parties at long intervals, or I make my frenzied dashes up to London, & leave, guiltily, as the clock strikes 11.

But let me bethink me that L. is very hard worked: the present state must go on till next Christmas, & to be forever worrying is fatal & cruel & only makes the question harder to settle amicably. Still I own I am depressed & baffled.
