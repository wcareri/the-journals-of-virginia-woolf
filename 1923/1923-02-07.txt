### Wednesday 7 February

Nessaâ€™s wedding day. Reflections suppressed. I must describe Cambridge. We walked from the station, past Rattee & Kett, cold, starry; dismal; then familiar; Kingâ€™s College Chapel, hasty wash & dress, & dine with Sheppard. He was in evening dress. He carries a knobbed cane. Maynard, Norton, & Betty to dinner. A good deal of raw time had to be manufactured. I had romanced so much about Cambridge that to find myself sitting there was an anti climax. No one else was excited. Then off in the motor to the A.D.C. I think I was genuinely excited, rather than moved by Oedipus Rex. The plot is so well tied; the storysâ  race so fast. Then the young menâ€™s faces; pink & plump under their wigs, moved me. I donâ€™t know whether memory poured a little mist. Among the audience were: Lytton, Irene Vanbrugh; Q; Faith; & so on. And so to bed; with Kingâ€™s bell saying very pompously all through the night the hour. We were happy & busy all Sunday, first Sheppard, then Pernel; sitting on the Backs, strolling up to Newnham the way I used to go; then lunching with the Shoves, & Fredegond is the image of Christina Rossetti. Her faith is charitable. She has nothing very definite to say. She attends mass. She is happier & more full of vitality than before she says. Gerald, she says, took her to be confirmed, watched with interest &, coming out, wished he had a faith; wished to be a Quaker, but has taken no further steps. I think she makes the most of chance words he lets fall. So to the Moores, finding Moore smoking alone, who asked us directly whether we would come up or have the children brought down. Stout Dorothy was bathing Timothy & smokingâ€”a truncated woman, amiable, red, a little beery; anyhow cheery; & Moore said, very kindly, dearie to the baby, crying for food, like a wise old nurse. Rather they were like a couple of fat beavers with their young. Fine little cubs too, fat, hard, sturdy, likely to do us all credit when we are all dead. The elegiac note will creep in, & shall be justified if I have time. Then to Maynardâ€™s: I must say the pleasantest sitting room I have ever been in, owing to the colours & paintings, curtains & decorations of Bell & Grant. Here we dined well. Ramsay, the unknown guest, was something like a Darwin, broad, thick, powerful, & a great mathematician, & clumsy to boot. Honest I should say, a true Apostle. The party began after a few brilliancies on my part about religion; emotional capital which I did not know how to invest, I said. And Maynard kept the old ball smartly rolling. Indeed we were rather talk-dazed. And as people arrived, I suppose oneâ€™s eyes tire; oneâ€™s brain stales. Lucas is slightly deaf, & pure & sincere, needs that is rather an effort to talk to in the grand style, about literature. Besides, I rather wished to hear Sprott praise Jacobâ€™s Room. Never mind. Mrs Birch, honourable Mrs Birch of Firle, was introduced; like a white wild fox, body perfectly trained, intelligence wild. not a bad combination. Like Vita she detests the scrolloping honours of the great, calls her family dull & stupid, complains of a girls life, Lowndes Square, Ascot, & Aunts who rail against what they call Bo-eemians. She should have married a Guardsman, & is now in Cambridge society, believing in Topsy as I could see, & in Mrs Dobree; humbly taking from our hands whatever we choose to give.

The depression which I mentioned comes partly from the uncertainty about the Nation. Leonard thinks himself a failure. And what use is there in denying a depression which is irrational? Canâ€™t I always think myself one too? It is inevitable. But there was Maynard arrived & trim, yet our junior. The absurd unreality of this as a standard strikes me, but it is not easy to make these truths effective. It is unpleasant waiting in a dependent kind of way to know what Massingham will do. The signs are favourable. Ramsay Muir, Maynardâ€™s editor, is on all hands a dull dog; Maynard is entreating Tomlinson to join him, & so support him against the Wee Frees, who are his co-directors. My notion is, he will float the Nation, make a splash, then dive off, & leave it to its fate within the year. It will dwindle & die. Massingham is optimistic, but delays at Monte Carlo, & we only hear, vaguely, that he has a good chance of starting a threepenny weekly to coincide with the break on April 1st.

And our depression comes too from the time of year, wet & wan, and from Joadâ€™s drawling voice, & Ralphâ€™s stubbornness, & from Lyttonâ€™s hint that he means to start the Tidmarsh Press at once. Here, however, is some mystery, for Carrington professed to know nothing of it, & would only admit to a press for printing refined books, on commissionâ€”I think Joad & Ralph daily for lunch & tea, & the need for bright talk, depress also; & I shall be glad when the 15th March arrives. I suppose the Press must now lose something of its charm, & become more strenuous; acquiring let us hope a different charm. But I wish Joad were, somehow, a lady. Now to Wigmore Hall with Saxon to hear a severe Franck quintet, beyond me no doubt.
