### Saturday 13 March

Written, for a wonder at 10 oâ€™clock at night, with L. doing Tolstoi at the white table; the fire rather hot, & my brain saturated with the Silent Woman. I am reading her because we now read plays at 46. 46 is become a centre. For how long we donâ€™t know, as Maynardâ€™s marriage approaches. Nessa, astride her fine Arab, life I mean, takes further upheavals all in the days work. I daresay I shall feel it more. 46 has been very pleasant to me this winter. Two nights ago the Nicolsons dined there. Exposed to electric light eggs show dark patches. I mean we judged them both incurably stupid. He is bluff, but oh so obvious; she, Duncan thought, took the cue from him, & had nothing free to say. There was Lytton, supple & subtle as an old leather glove, to emphasise their stiffness. It was a rocky steep evening. We had the photographs out. Lytton said â€œI donâ€™t like your motherâ€™s character. Her mouth seems complainingâ€ & a shaft of white light fell across my dusky rich red past.

And then? As to the soul, Iâ€™ve been snubbed by Squire. I sent him my memoir article, asking terms: he accepted, offering Â£13; Â£15 I said, or my ms back; & got it back by return. And now I accept Â£13â€”which perhaps I shanâ€™t get after all. Yet I dont much mind. & only think that poverty & the shifts it puts one to is unbecoming, as Iâ€™ve said. Poor Tom the other day actually couldnâ€™t speak for tears (thanking us) on the telephone. He is broken down, & yet must buckle to & decide: shall he take the Nation? can he defeat Maynard? Iâ€™m tired of writing the word guaranteeâ€”which is what he claims. To show his state, Richmond actually rang me up at 10 p.m. & asked me to intervene with Maynard. He seemed â€˜distraughtâ€™ he said. Whether distraught people can edit the Nation lit. sup. I doubt. And it is more or less my doing. And I dont feel important. And after all we are happy. And Ralph is gone, casually, without good bye. I have seen Osbert Sitwell, Sebastian Sprot & Mr Mortimer. As Nessa says, we are becoming fashionable. Sprot & I lunched at Maryâ€™s; then, tipsy with echoing brains, went to tea at Hillâ€™s in High Street. Infinitely old I felt & rich; he is very poor. His mother used to attend Barkerâ€™s linen sales, so that he knew High Street. I dont know why his experience seemed to me so meagre. His father is a solicitor at Crowborough. He wished to meet Ottoline. He is hungry as a wolf, & snapping up delicacies in an alarming way. If at his age I had met Ottoline!â€”still, I wasnâ€™t much older. I have been reflecting about society again, & think one of its merits is that it needs courage. The going into rooms properly dressed is alarming. No one cares for one; that snubs vanity; one is on equal terms with oneâ€™s fellows. The privileges of the fireside no longer prevail. But Ethel is off till October; & I donâ€™t know where next I shall alight. Indeed this is scribbled before a break.â€”Only for one month, but then physically, perhaps spiritually, the journey is long. How great writers write at night, I donâ€™t know. Its an age since I tried, & I find my head full of pillow stuffing: hot; inchoate. And tomorrow I must get on with How it Strikes a Contemporary. Alas, for the break in my scheme of workâ€”but we must make money, just when I donâ€™t want to; & so the novels get shelved, & Reading, which I had tackled afresh, must be put away, & I must accept Desmondâ€™s reviewing, & Maynardâ€™s too, if offered; still I havenâ€™t any good cause to complain.
