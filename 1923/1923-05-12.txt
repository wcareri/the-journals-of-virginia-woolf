### Sunday 12 May

It is a curious fact that I can write this diary when I am too much distracted to read. Being Sunday, I am clearing off old letters, half formal; & seven strikes; & 15 minutes canâ€™t be made much of for any purpose. I might attempt a portrait. Karin was here yesterday with Ann. Adrian is altogether broken up by psycho analysis. (long interruption question of printing Read) His soul rent in pieces with a view to reconstruction. The doctor says he is a tragedy: & this tragedy consists in the fact that he canâ€™t enjoy life with zest. I am probably responsible. I should have paired with him, instead of hanging on to the elders. So he wilted, pale, under a stone of vivacious brothers & sisters. Karin says we shall see a great change in 3 months. But Noel would have done what none of these doctors can do. The truth is that Karin, being deaf, & as she honestly says, â€œYour sister-in-law lacks humanity, as perhaps youâ€™ve noticedâ€, the truth is she does not fertilise the sunk places in Adrian. Neither did I. Had mother lived, or father been screened offâ€”well, it puts it too high to call it a tragedy. Ann is like him, pale, lank, sensitive, with the long cold fingers I know so well. For my part, I doubt if family life has all the power of evil attributed to it, or psycho-analysis of good. I liked Karin; pitied her too; & then felt come over me some mood of depression, not worth entering upon here.

Morgan told me that when he & Mortimer discussed novelists the other day they agreed that Lawrence & I were the only two whose future interested them. They think of my next book, which I think of calling â€œThe Hoursâ€, with excitement. This does encourage me. Oddly enough, I get praise from my contemporaries, or youngers; never from old stagers, who are said to step so generously from their platforms with words of encouragment.

But I cannot describe Garsington. Thirty seven people to tea; a bunch of young men no bigger than asparagus; walking to & fro, round & round; compliments, attentions, & then this slippery mudâ€”which is what interests me at the moment. A loathing overcomes me of human beingsâ€”their insincerity, their vanityâ€”A wearisome & rather defiling talk with Ott. last night is the foundation of this complaintâ€”& then the blend in oneâ€™s own mind of suavity & sweetness with contempt & bitterness. Her egotism is so great. â€œI am much more sensitive than most peopleâ€ she said to Julian: the first words she said that she meant. She returns to that subject again & againâ€”to herself that is. And her lies have taken away all outlines. Yet on Saturday night I liked her. This was all clear to me a few minutes ago, but now I cannot write it.

Lytâ tâ on & I talked all the way up in the train. He had seen a Greek Temple at Segestum. And thatâ€™s what I adore in himâ€”his enthusiasm for beauty. He said it was like Sophocles. You saw the sea through the columns. Then we discussed Shâ akespeare: he said he wanted to write about Shre as a dramatist; not as a philosopher or poet. He wanted to discuss his contrasts. The scene with Emilia in Othello for instance. And he may write on Lear from this point of view. And Sir Thomas Browne, & the letters of Phalaris; I think he has written something that pleases him. He is absolutely happy. He is in love with Ralph. He has that extraordinary simplicity he said tenderly, tremulously, talking of Ralph & Othello. But why not let oneself be content in the thought of Lyttonâ€”so true, gentle, infinitely nimble, & humane? I seldom rest long in complete agreement with anyone. But here I think oneâ€™s feelings should be unqualified.

Lord David is a pretty boy. Puffin Asquith an ugly oneâ€”wizened, unimpressive, sharp, like a street boy. Sackville West reminded me of a peevish shop girl. They have all the same clipped quick speech & politeness, & total insignificance. Yet we asked Ld David & Puff to write for the Nation, & also a dull fat man called Hartley. What puts me on edge is that Iâ€™m writing like this here, & spoke so differently to Ott. Iâ€™m over peevish in private, partly in order to assert myself. I am a great deal interested suddenly in my book. I want to bring in the despicableness of people like Ott: I want to give the slipperiness of the soul. I have been too tolerant often. The truth is people scarcely care for each other. They have this insane instinct for life. But they never become attached to anything outside themselves. Puff said he loved his family, & had nothing whatever to knock over. He disliked cold indecency. So did Lord David. This must be a phrase in their set. Puff saidâ€”I dont quite know what. I walked round the vegetable garden with him, passing Lytton flirting with Byam Shaw on a green seat; & round the field with Sackville West, who said he was better & was writing a better novel, & round the lake with Menasseh (?) an Egyptian Jew, who said he liked his family, & they were mad & talked like books; & he said that they quoted my writings (the Oxford youth) & wanted me to go & speak; & then there was Mrs Asquith. I was impressed. She is stone white: with the brown veiled eyes of an aged falcon; & in them more depth & scrutiny than I expected; a character, with her friendliness, & ease, & decision. Oh if we could have had Shelleyâ€™s poems, & not Shelley the man! she said. Shelley was quite intolerable, she pronounced; she is a rigid frigid puritan; & in spite of spending thousands on dress. She rides life, if you like; & has picked up a thing or two, which I should like to plunder & never shall. She led Lytton off, & plucked his arm, & hurried, & thought â€˜peopleâ€™ pursued her; yet was very affable with â€˜peopleâ€™ when she had to be; sat on the window sill talking to a black shabby embroideress, to whom Ott. is being kind. Thats one of her horrorsâ€”sheâ€™s always being kind in order to say to herself at night & then Ottoline invites the poor little embroideress to her party, & so to round off her own picture of herself. To sneer like this has a physical discomfort in it. She told me I looked wonderfully well, wh. I disliked. Why? I wonder. Because I had had a headache perhaps, partly. But to be well & use strength to get more out of life is, surely, the greatest fun in the world. What I dislike is feeling that Iâ€™m always taking care, or being taken care of. Never mindâ€”work, work. Lytton says we have still 20 years before us. Mrs Asquith said she loved Scott. If I had time I would describe my surprise visit from Sydney, & my revelations about Murryâ€™s duplicity. This is a very great shock, Sydney said. Sydney said that Murry has an angel & a devil in him. That is melodramatic said Sydney; but I do believe it. Dunning believes it. I cant help liking Sydneyâ€”fundamentally honest; fundamentally weak; gullible; & now settling down to â€˜reposeâ€™, which is very delightful. And heâ€™s a vegetarian. Such a simplification, he said. But if I saw you every day for a week I could tell you what has been happening to me. Vegetarianism is part of a whole revolutionâ€”Donâ€™t I know it without being told it. And the Adelphi would inform me, were I ignorant. Now for Urn Burial for the Times.
