### Sunday 7 January

Let the scene open on the doorstep of number 50 Gordon Square. We went up last night, carrying our bags, & a Ceylonese sword. There was Mary H. in lemon coloured trousers with green ribbons. & so we sat down to dinner; off cold chicken. In came Roger & Adrian & Karin; & very slowly we coloured our faces & made ready for number 46. It was the proudest moment of Cliveâ€™s life when he led Mary on one arm, Virginia on the other, into the drawing room, which was full, miscellaneous; & oriental for the most part. Suppose oneâ€™s normal pulse to be 70: in five minutes it was 120: & the blood, not the sticky whitish fluid of daytime, but brilliant & prickling like champagne. This was my state, & most peoples. We collided, when we met: went pop, used Christian names, flattered, praised, & thought (or I did) of Shakespeare. At any rate I thought of him when the singing was doingâ€”Shâ akespearâ e I thought would have liked us all tonight. Not that Bobo was other than a damp owl, with some private gloom which being too personal for my taste, she brought with her. Then there was a plain woodfaced Darwinâ€”which? And Hussey, like a Victorian seamstress by a table covered in mohair checks. My luck was in though, & I found good quarters with Frankie & Sheppard & Bunny, & Lydiaâ€”all my friends in short. But what we talked about I hardly know. Bunny asked me to be his childs godmother. And a Belgian wants to translate me. Arnold Bennett thinks me wonderful &â€”&â€”(these, no doubt were elements in my hilarity). Gumbo distorted nursery rhymes; Lydia danced; there were charades; Sickert acted Hamlet. We were all easy & gifted & friendly & like good children rewarded by having the capacity for enjoying ourselves thus. Could our fathers? I, wearing my mothers laces, looked at Maryâ€™s little soft Jerboa face in the old looking glassâ€”& wondered.

I daresay no one said anything very brilliant. I sat by Sickert, & liked him, talking in his very workmanlike, but not at all society manner, of painting, & Whistler; of an operation he saw at Dieppe. But can life be worth so much pain, he asked? â€œPour respirerâ€ said the Dr. That is enough. But for two years â€˜after my wifeâ€™s deathâ€™ I did not wish to live said Sickert. There is something indescribably congenial to me in this easy artists talk; the values the same as my own & therefore right; no impediments; life charming, good & interesting; no effort; art brooding calmly over it all; & none of this attachment to mundane things, which I find in Chelsea. For Sickert said, why should one be attached to oneâ€™s own body & breakfast? Why not be satisfied to let others have the use of ones life, & live it over again, being dead oneself? No mysticism, & therefore a great relish for the actual thingsâ€”whatever they may beâ€”old plays, girls, boys, Proust, Handel sung by Oliver; the turn of a head & so on.

As parties do, this one began to dwindle, until a few persistent talkers were left by themselves sitting in such odd positionsâ€”Oliver full length by Barbara on the floor; Ralph astride a chair in the middle of the room; Lytton & I side by side on the sofa.

â€œAnd what do you think of the Tidmarsh Pressâ€, said Lytton.

And this was his craftly way of telling me that Ralph means to set up on his own, or rather on his own after the Hogarth model after easter. Lytton was anxious to sound me. Should we think it poaching? For it would be exactly the same as the Hogarth Press. I said I should say sharp things, but there was quite enough work for two. In the middle of the night of course I blazed up & abused Ralph for a pickpocket (myself to myself that is). But Lytton was not altogether urbane. He is possessive. His baby shall have his toy, & he shanâ€™t share it with anyone else this time. Wellâ€”so be it. The immediate effect is to make L. & me set toâ€”wire in as Nelly would sayâ€”& bestir ourselves for the future. We wont be downed by the prestige & power & pomposity of all the Benson medallists in England. In fact, the struggle is invigorating; though it does not improve our opinion of the ass. I especially dislike his effect upon Lytton. Lytton becomes jealous, & suspicious, & uses his wits to make the worse appear the better cause. Love is the devil. No character can stand up against it. But this passed in our trivial champagne pricking way. And so, at 3, I suppose, back to no. 50 to which Clive had gone previously.

I went up & found the light burning & so turned it out. I noticed a bluish glimmer under Cliveâ€™s door. â€œReading in bed,â€ I thought, & hoped I should not be called in to talk. But the house was too noisy for me to sleep. People seemed to be walking. Then a woman cried, as if in anguish, in the street, & I thought of Mrs Thompson waiting to be executed. I turned about. Footsteps sounded. A door opened. I heard voices. At this hour, I thought innocently, no one can be up without causeâ€”illness or accident. So up I jumped, thrust in my upper teeth, & opened the door.

â€œIs something wrong?â€ I asked of Cliveâ€™s shadow on his bedroom wall, for his door was open.

â€œI hope Iâ€™ve not waked youâ€, he said.

Obviously nothing was wrong. The shriek was Maryâ€™s.

And so we breakfasted together this morning, with the church bells ringing, & all the houses full of Stracheys, Grants, Stephens & Bells & Partridgesâ€”a wet grey morning, in the heart of London, where I am so seldom at that hour.

Such is my frontispiece, which needless to say, I meant to make more brilliant, but as Nessa said this morning, I dont want brilliance. The only thing I care for is to be at my ease, (we were discussing Mary).

Now, briefly to make out my work list.

I shall write at Mrs Dalloway till, next Monday, perhaps, bringing her into full talk, I hope.

Shall I then dash off an article for Squire upon memoirs? which will take till Monday 29th. Then do the Greek chapter, for which I shall have read Odyssey (6 books) Agamemnon: Oedipus Tyrannus, Zimmern, Jebbâ€™s Homerâ€”Life of Jebb, & some dialogue of Platoâ€™s? This puts off writing till rather late in the day; but I want to make myself a certain amount of money regularly, if only for pocket money. Now, therefore, I must finish Pilkington; read Greek regularly; & tackle, perhaps, another vol of Proust. First then, I must master the Agamemnon (this refers to the immediate moment). & before doing that I must write to the new apparition Vita, who gives me a book every other day.
