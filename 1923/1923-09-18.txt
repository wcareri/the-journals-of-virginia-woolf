### Tuesday 18 September

Leonardâ€™s day in London, & left with 30 minutes before I walk off to meet him I may as well write here. We have had visitorsâ€”Lytton & the Partridges, unexpectedly; then Nessa & Duncan; then Morgan for the week end. There are times when I want no one, times when I relish the commonest animated slug. I am worn smooth with talk at the moment, & so did not come to grips with my friends, as I should have done. Yet how good, kind, tender, & clever we all are! Chiefly I remember sitting on the wall of the public house with Duncan & discussing his painting. He said he was trying to simplify; he wants I think, to express something very abstract simply. His own loveliness seems to him now negligible. â€œNessa is a happy artistâ€ he said in the bus (I went in to Lewes). I am a stupid artist she said. She has none of these changes. She does not think things out. Sometimes I am quite ready not to paint for a long time. I suppose he is intellectual, as I suppose I am; & she more instinctive. Yet she changes too. They notice old women & babies all the time. We stood in the High Street, & saw a man drive out of the White Hart, close clipped as a convict, wearing a hard grey bowler, & driving a high stepping piebald. Duncan could not imagine what his life was. So I walked home. Not much talk of interest with Lytton. He pounced on our books. Oh books, books! he cried, & carried off Mortimerâ€™s Oxford Circus. Fame has made him confident, taken from him I suppose, some charm, turned it to strength of some kind. I always feel a kind of mass now behind his view of his own writing. The French at the Monastery had been so enthusiastic about Racine. That set him up, & made it needless to praise his articles in the Nation, which are not, so we think, good.

Very well. We all grow old; grow stocky; lose our pliancy & impressionability. Even Morgan seems to me to be based on some hidden rock. Talking of Proust & Lawrence he said heâ€™d prefer to be Lawrence; but much rather would be himself. We discussed his novels. I donâ€™t think I am a novelist, he said. Suddenly I said â€œNo, I donâ€™t think you areâ€ Ah! he exclaimed, eagerly, interested, not dashed. But L. denied this. â€œIâ€™m not at all downcast about my literary careerâ€, he said. I think he has made up his mind that he has much to fall back on. He is aloof, serene, a snob, he says, reading masterpieces only. We had a long gossip about servants. He found wasps in the mint sauce. This made Agnes drop the dish & go off leaving the dining room door open. Mrs Forster was cold to her for some days. â€œShe will begin to scream & die of appendicitisâ€ he said. And so to Miss Grant Duff & his quarrel in Alexandria. But it grows cold & dark; I shall walk off to meet L.
