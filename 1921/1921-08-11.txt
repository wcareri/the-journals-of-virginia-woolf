### Thursday 11 August

A fortnight already gone. It goes too quickâ€”too quick. If only one could sip slowly & relish every grain of every hour! For, to speak the truth, Iâ€™ve thought of making my will for the first time during these past weeks. Sometimes it seems to me that I shall never write out all the books I have in my head, because of the strain. The devilish thing about writing is that it calls upon every nerve to hold itself taut. That is exactly what I cannot doâ€”Now if it were painting or scribbling music or making patchwork quilts or mud pies, it wouldntâ€™ matter.

The first thing that happened when we came here was that a branch blew down off Allisonâ€™s tree. It lies with its branches standing up in the air, on a sloping part of the meadow, & the children of the cottages collect every morning & swing from rope, or are twirled round & round, till dark. A girl of 12 superintends, & I see her at work swinging the small children hour after hour. Sometimes they cry; sometimes quarrel; but the amusement lasts them. I suppose Julian & Quentin would soon be tired of it. No nurse would consent to stand there swinging them.

In the evening sometimes thereâ€™s a game of stoolball. I caught them at it, as I stood in the road beneath, pink & blue & red & yellow frocks raised above me, & nothing behind them but the vast Asheham hillsâ€”a sight too beautiful for one pair of eyes. Instinctively I want someone to catch my overflow of pleasure.
