### Sunday 2 January 1921

(The first time Iâ€™ve written 1921. And it shouldnâ€™t be written hereâ€”should be written on the first page of a new bookâ€”but weâ€™re just back from Monkâ€™s, & I cant settle to anythingâ€”must indeed take a bath & wash my head instantly.) I want to scribble notes of the Rodmell social. Talk with Mrs Hawkesford. Cheery looking woman with pimple on end of nose, dressed in dirty ermines. We gentry sat together; rustics tramping up & down the room (the schoolroom) bumping into me; solemn; spiritlessâ€”oh infinitely pathetic the â€˜partiesâ€™ of the poor! Anyhow not so badly off as clergymenâ€™s wives. The first thing she told me, with passion, was that Russellâ€™s had sent a plain instead of a fruit cake. â€œThats the way they treat you in the country. I canâ€™t go 7 miles to complain. None of us like plain cakes. So it wonâ€™t be eaten. I had to make another cake today. And sometimes they send things so badly packedâ€”in dirty paper tooâ€”that they fall to pieces when theyâ€™re undoneâ€”â€ Then, without preface, to the sorrows of family life. Olive in London, member of the forum, wonâ€™t stick to anything, now giving dancing lessons with Miss Barker â€œusing Miss Barkerâ€™s name of course. Lady Portarlington is joining. Still, she wonâ€™t marry, girls dont who take to those waysâ€”& whats to happen in middle life? Thats what I say.â€ Then Bowen. Almost 18 but wont put her hair upâ€”â€œWhat am I to do? Thereâ€™s no life for a girl hereâ€”no girl friendsâ€”She hears Olive talk of London. Sheâ€™ll go next. If she leaves me I dont think I shall be able to stand it. I never sent her to a school so that she mightnâ€™t get unsettled. We go to Brighton. Sheâ€™s fond of lectures. She likes chemistry. Olive says she ought to read The Times. We dont take The Timesâ€”nor does Mr Allinson, He lends us picture papers. But she ought to read the debates. Then she could talk to people. Why I can hardly talk to educated people now. One gets out of things. One sees no one. Things happen without oneâ€™s knowing.â€ She had been in London, & stayed with friends in W. Kensington (where she was brought up) & their house looked over Queens. â€œAlways some game going onâ€”ideal I call itâ€. She had made Bowen learn tennis at Tonbridge. â€œBut we were only there for a fortnightâ€”not long enough to learn. Sheâ€™s so shyâ€”People are so stand offish in Lewes. Nothing is ever got up. No tennis parties. Mr Babington (Lord Monk Brettonâ€™s people you know) had a lawn at Rodmell Place. Mr Duberly turned his pony on it. Now its given up completely.â€ I offered books, tennis, & The Times. Real unhappiness of courseâ€”such isolation too; a cruelty to animals to keep a woman without interests alone in the country to magnify cakes. Still canâ€™t go to London because in London a clergyman depends upon pew rents. I should have to pay calls. I should have to make myself nice to people. And we should only get a poor parish. Oh I dont say a word against thisâ€”or the peopleâ€”only for 7 years weâ€™ve not had a roadâ€”its too badâ€”
