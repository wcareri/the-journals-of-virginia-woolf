### Friday 29 April

A great deal to say, I suppose: a great many portraits to sketch; conversations to write down; & reflections to work inâ€”had I time; which I have not (& that sentence reminds me that I mean to read Marvell.) But every afternoon for a week Iâ€™ve been up to the AEolian Hall; taken my seat right at the back; put my bag on the floor & listened to Beethoven quartets. Do I dare say listened? Well, but if one gets a lot of pleasure, really divine pleasure, & knows the tunes, & only occasionally thinks of other thingsâ€”surely I may say listened. We are just back from the 5th: & I had my hand clasped by Lady Cromer in the street: we had tea with Lytton, Carrington & Ralph.

I ought to say something of Lytton. I have seen him oftener these last days than for a whole year perhaps. We have talked about his book & my book. This particular conversation took place in Verreys: gilt feathers: mirrors: blue walls & Lytton & I taking our tea & brioche in a corner: we must have sat well over an hour.

â€œAnd I woke last night & wondered where to place youâ€ I said. â€œThereâ€™s St Simon & La BruyÃ¨re.  
Oh God, he groaned.  
And Macaulay I added.  
â€œYes, Macaulayâ€ he said. â€œA little better than Macaulay.â€  
But not his mass, I insisted. More civilisation of course. And then youâ€™ve only written short books.  
Iâ€™m going to do George the IVth next, he said.  
Well but your place, I insisted.  
And yours he asked  
â€œIâ€™m the â€˜ablest of living women novelistsâ€™â€ I saidâ€”So the British weekly says.  
â€œYou influence meâ€ he said.

And he said he could always recognise my writing though I wrote so many different styles, â€œwhich is the result of hard workâ€ I insisted. And then we discussed historians: Gibbon: a kind of Henry James, I volunteered. Oh dear noâ€”not in the least he said.

â€œHe has a point of view & sticks to itâ€ I said. â€œAnd so do you. I wobble.â€ But what is Gibbon?  
Oh heâ€™s there all right; Lytton said. Forster says heâ€™s an Impâ . But he hadnâ€™t many views. He believed in â€˜virtueâ€™ perhaps.  
A beautiful word, I said.

But just read how the hordes of barbarians devastated the City. Its marvellous. True, he was queer about the Early Xtiansâ€”didnâ€™t see anything in them at all. But read him. Iâ€™m going to next October. And Iâ€™m going to Florence, & I shall be very lonely in the evenings.

The French have influenced you more than the English, I suppose, I said.

Yes. I have their definiteness. Iâ€™m formed.  
I compared you with Carlyle the other day, I said. I read the Reminiscences. Well theyâ€™re the chatter of an old toothless grave digger compared with you: only then he has phrases.  
Ah yes, he has them, said Lytton. But I read him to Norton & James the other day, & they shoutedâ€”they wouldnâ€™t have it. Iâ€™m a little anxious though about â€˜massâ€™. Thatâ€™s my danger is it?  
Yes: You may cut too fine I said. But its a magnificent subjectâ€”George the IVthâ€”& what fun, setting to work on it.  
And your novel?  
Oh I put in my hand & rummage in the bran pie. Thats whats so wonderful. And its all different.  
Yes. Iâ€™m 20 people.  
But one sees the whole from the outside.  
The worst of George IVth is that no one mentions the facts I want. History must be written all over again. Its all moralityâ€”  
& battles, I added.

And then we walked through the streets together, for I had to buy coffee.
