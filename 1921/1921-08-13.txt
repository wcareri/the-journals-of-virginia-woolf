â€œColeridge was as little fitted for action as Lamb, but on a different account. His person was of a good height, but as sluggish & solid as the otherâ€™s was light & fragile. He had, perhaps, suffered it to look old before its time, for want of exercise. His hair was white at 50; & as he generally dressed in black, & had a very tranquil demeanour, his appearance was gentlemanly, & for several years before his death was reverend. Nevertheless, there was something invincibly young in the look of his face. It was round & fresh-coloured, with agreeable features, & an open, indolent, good natured mouth. This boy-like expression was very becoming in one who dreamed & speculated as he did when he was really a boy, & who passed his life apart from the rest of the world, with a book, & his flowers. His forehead was prodigious,â€”a great piece of placid marble;â€”& his fine eyes, in which all the activity of his mind seemed to concentrate, moved under it with a sprightly ease, as if it was a pastime to them to carry all that thought.

â€œAnd it was pastime. Hazlitt said, that Coleridgeâ€™s genius appeared to him like a spirit, all head & wings, eternally floating about in etherialities. He gave me a different impression. I fancied him a good natured wizard, very fond of earth, & conscious of reposing with weight enough in his easy chair, but able to conjure his etherialities about him in the twinkling of an eye. He cd. also change them by thousands, & dismiss them as easily when his dinner came. It was a mighty intellect put upon a sensual body; & the reason why he did little more with it than talk & dream was, that it is agreeable to such a body to do little else. I do not mean that C. was a sensualist in an ill senseâ€¦.â€ which is all that I can take the trouble to quote from Leigh Huntâ€™s memoirs vol 2 page 223, supposing I should want to cook this up again somewhere. L.H. was our spiritual grandfather, a free man. One could have spoken to him as to Desmond. A light man, I daresay, but civilised, much more so than my grandfather in the flesh. These free, vigorous spirits advance the world, & when one lights on them in the strange waste of the past one says Ah youâ€™re my sortâ€”a great compliment. Most people who died 100 years ago are like strangers. One is polite & uneasy with them. Shelley died with H.â€™s copy of Lamia in his hand. H. wd. receive it back from no other, & so burnt it on the pyre. Going home from the funeral? H. & Byron laughed till they split. This is human nature, & H. doesnâ€™t mind owning to it. Then I like his inquisitive human sympathies: history so dull because of its battles & laws; & sea voyages in books so dull because the traveller will describe beauties instead of going into the cabins & saying what the sailors looked like, wore, eat, said; how they behaved.

Lady Carlisle is dead. One likes people much better when theyre battered down by a prodigious seige of misfortune than when they triumph. Such a stock of hope & gifts she set out with, & lost everything (so they say) & died of sleepy sickness, her 5 sons dead before her, & the war crushing her hope for humanity.
