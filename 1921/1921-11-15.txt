### Tuesday 15 November

Really, reallyâ€”this is disgracefulâ€”15 days of November spent & my diary none the wiser. But when nothing is written one may safely suppose that I have been stitching books; or we have had tea at 4 & I have taken my walk afterwards; or I have had to read something for next days writing, or I have been out late, & come home with stencilling materials, & sat down in excitement to try one. We went to Rodmell, & the gale blew at us all day; off arctic fields; so we spent our time attending to the fire. The day before this I wrote the last words of Jacobâ€”on Friday Nov. 4th to be precise, having begun it on April 16 1920: allowing for 6 months interval due to Monday or Tuesday & illness, this makes about a year. I have not yet looked at it. I am struggling with Henry Jamesâ€™ ghost stories for The Times; have I not just laid them down in a mood of satiety?â€” Then I must do Hardy; then I want to write a life of Newnes; then I shall have to furbish up Jacob; & one of these days, if only I could find energy to tackle the Paston letters, I must start Reading: directly Iâ€™ve started Reading I shall think of another novel, I daresay. So that the only question appears to beâ€”will my fingers stand so much scribbling?

We dined with Clive on Friday. Aldous & Mary & Maynard there. All the time I felt Mary solicitous, even affectionate; & sure enough, as I left she took my hand, said â€œI donâ€™t like this plan of quarrellingâ€ & asked me to come & see her. So far nothing has happenedâ€”for was I to ring her up, or she meâ€”& whatâ€™s it all about?

Molly came to tea. Lilian came to lunch. Poor Lilianâ€”poor Margaret. They sit beside the corpse of the Womenâ€™s Guild; the blinds are drawn; they are sad & white, brave, tearless, but infinitely mournful. I see what has happened. When one leaves a life work at 60, one dies. Death, at least, must seem to be there, visible, expectant. One ought to workâ€”never to take oneâ€™s eyes from oneâ€™s work; & then if death should interrupt, well, it is merely that one must get up & leave oneâ€™s stitchingâ€”one wonâ€™t have wasted a thought on death. Margaret says in her work one gets superannuated. One must give it up. A very cruel work then; & she is left without husband or child. So we dragged Lilian over Richmond; but she saw nothing but the ground. Very unhappy she said she was. And Janet wants to sell her odious house & move to the New Forest. I canâ€™t say that elderly group has met with the fate it deserves.

Molly was dressed in Mrs Freshfieldâ€™s velvets. A skirt is enough for an ordinary dress I daresay. â€œHave we quarrelled with Desmond?â€ we asked. Dear dear no. We seem to him cranky & crusty? Oh nonsense. Oh well thats all right thenâ€”Desmond is merely lazy. He is very uncommunicative just now. He tells me nothing. You have heard about the Waterlows? Sydney has become quite intolerable. He plants red flowers & they come up blue. She can do nothing nothing right. He grumbles all the week end. So at last she forbade him to come down. But he couldnâ€™t stand another Alice walking out of the house. They have been abroad for 6 weeks. She broke down & told me the whole thing. We must just go on disliking each other as other couples do, she said.
