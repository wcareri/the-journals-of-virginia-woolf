### Sunday 11 December

Yes, I ought to be doing the beds; but Leonard insists upon doing them himself. Perhaps thatâ€™s Lottie on the stairs? Ought I to go out & scold her for not staying in bed? Is the hot water on? Well, soon it will be time to go out & eat a plate of meat in the restaurant in the passage. In other words, both the servants have German measles, & for 3 days we have been servants instead of masters.

Excuse this scrawl therefore;â€”surely that is Lottie washing up?  
Well, what news can I get in?  
We went to Heartbreak House with the Pâ artridgeâ s. & Lytton. Lytton had just bought a manuscript by Mde du Deffand. Lytton is ripe like a peach in the sun. Carrington wears his old overcoat cut down. Partridge laughs at the wrong jokes.

There was John & Mrs John slightly gross & elderly: wine making his lines thick; & her face more substantial.

Kot dined here. Why did I go to bed with the gooseflesh after hearing discourse of Sullivan Gertler & Sydney Waterlow? They have grease in their texture. And they despise women. And now & then Kot talks like a man of the underworld. Noâ€”I cannot make anything of this, what with one thing & another.

I mark that for perhaps the 50th time, I am frustrated as I mean to write poor T. Hardy. I pray that he sits safe & sound by his fireside at this moment. May all bicycles, bronchitises, & influenzas keep far from him.
