### Sunday 17 April

And I was perfectly right. The strike didnâ€™t happen. About 7 oâ€™clock L. rang up Margaret & heard that the Triple Alliance had split: the railwaymen & transport workers refusing to go on with it, & leaving the miners by themselves. Nothing is yet accurately known. Presumably the miners will have to give in, & I shall get my hot bath, bake home made bread again; yet it seems a pity somehowâ€”if theyâ€™re to be forced back & the mine owners triumphant. I think this is my genuine feeling, though not very profound. It is fairly obvious that working people are well enough satisfied to prefer going on working; I remember the pleasure of the railwaymen when they started running about platforms & leaning out of engines again.

Yesterday we had our avenue walkâ€”the first for a long while; & L. explained the plan of his new bookâ€”a revised version of the Wandering Jew. Very original & solid, it seemed to me; & like a good business man, I pressed him to promise it for the press. Its true that sales & reviews flag, & I much doubt if M. & T. will sell 500, or cover expenses. But I want to push on with it nevertheless; & a solid big book like L.â€™s is essential. We discussed all this walking down the Avenue; looking in at the iron gates of Ham House, & so home to tea, & a Russian lesson with Kot, & now I must write to Lytton & polish off a review. Always these last paragraphs floor me.
