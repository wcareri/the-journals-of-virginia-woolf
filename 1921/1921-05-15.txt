### Sunday 15 May

Whit Sundayâ€”dull, wet, & cold; so that on the whole we dont blame the coal strike for keeping us here over the fire instead of Monks House. Moreover, L. has a chill in his inside, & sits rather dismally with his head in his hand, poor man, allowed no tea or coffee. Its that I should mindâ€”all the romance of the day dulled. By this time I think Carrington will have made up her mind one way or tâ€™other. She must have had an odious Sunday. But still she must make up her mind. So I told Ralph on Friday, broaching that topic after all these months of silence. He did it himself, rather, by telling me of his gloom of the night before: his loneliness. â€œI wished for my motherâ€ he said. â€œThough she irritates me, & I could tell her nothing.â€ He was very shrewd & bitter about C. â€œShe thinks herself one of the little friends of all the worldâ€ he said. Then he said she was selfish, untruthful, & quite indifferent to his suffering. So people in love always turn & rend the loved, with considerable insight too. He was speaking the truth largely. But I expect he was biassed; & also I expectâ€”& indeed told himâ€”that he is a bit of an ogre & tyrant. He wants more control than I should care to giveâ€”control I mean of the body & mind & time & thoughts of his loved. Thereâ€™s his danger & her risk; so I donâ€™t much envy her making up her mind this wet Whit Sunday.

I read 4 pages of sneer & condescending praise of me in the Dial the other day. Oddly enough, I have drawn the sting of it by deciding to print it among my puffs, where it will come in beautifully. The Dial is everything honest vigorous & advanced; so I ought to feel crushed. L. went on selling all last week. I very slowly dribble. Tchekhov is at a standstill. But we hear that never was there such a season for all commodities, in proof of which not a picture at the London Group was sold 2 days ago, though many are worth buying. And did I say?â€”we propose to spend Â£1000 a year upon a tea shop, book shop, gallery in Bond Street. After all, why not? I like rummaging in the great Bran pie, as Iâ€™ve said before: thus we rout middle age for one thing; for another, such queer specimens come out of it. There was Mr Reginald Morris on the hearthrug the other dayâ€”a very bad poet from Hounslow.
