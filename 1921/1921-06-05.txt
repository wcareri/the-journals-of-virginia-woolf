### Sunday 5 June

Poor Hervey Fisher has been buried a week, & is as if he had never been, I suppose: though if I chose I could imagine some feelings on the part of Adeline. Fredegond told us that he once lost his temper with Herbert, walked up to him & licked his eyelashes!

We went to Miss Royde Smithâ€™s party on Thursday to discuss Ireland. Never did I see a less attractive woman than Naomi. Her face might have been cut out of cardboard by blunt scissors. I fixed her with my eye. She fixed me with hers. But I got to the bottom of hers & jumped on the rock in a second. She is slightly furred too; dressed Ã  la 1860; swinging ear rings, skirt in balloons; & a body that billows out but perfectly hard. There she sat in complete command. Here she had her world round her. It was a queer mixture of the intelligent & the respectable. There were two clergymen. They made jokes, which were well within the bounds of decency. My translation of their attitude would be â€œSee how free & playful & advanced we areâ€”yet we have not sacrificed niceness. We are people of the world. Very open minded. Not mere intellectualsâ€”noâ€”look how nicely we dress.â€ Lady Rhondda was more plain dealing I thought; a solid bull dog, something after Rayâ€™s pattern. I detest the mixture of ideas & South Kensington. Then Rose Macaulay chipped in with her witticism all in character at which the clergyman, Duncan Jones, said â€˜Oh Rose!â€™ & everyone laughed loud, as if Rose had done the thing they expected. Yes, I disliked it all a good dealâ€”& the furniture & the picturesâ€”the marriage of conventionality & the Saturday Westminster. I talked to Robert Lyndâ€”& I didnâ€™t much care for him. He is a true journalistâ€”all spent in clever words, elongated, exhausted, voluble, with the cloudy shifty look in the eyes which comes of catering perpetually for the Daily News. I can fancy him much liked. Thereâ€™s no bite about these people. I tried to be elderly & broad minded. I thought of Bloomsbury. But then in Bloomsbury you would come up against something hardâ€”a Maynard, or a Lytton, or even Clive.

Murry has written against our Tchekhov in the Nation. As for Kot, yesterday he couldnâ€™t keep his seat for fury. He verged on the voice & language of the public houseâ€”He said the sort of thing Iâ€™ve heard men say before they kick each other out. Is Murry â€œa damned swindlerâ€? Suppose we admired Murryâ€™s writing, would he change his tune? In my theory heâ€™s all parched for praiseâ€”run mad for lack of it. Yet it goes against my psychology to think people scoundrels. Moreover theyâ€™re more interesting if you can keep the stew on the boil. I think heâ€™s a greater mix than the rest of us. I donâ€™t knowâ€”at this moment I incline to think him a damned swindlerâ€”only a swindler so plausible that heâ€™ll become Professor of English literature in the University of Oxford.
