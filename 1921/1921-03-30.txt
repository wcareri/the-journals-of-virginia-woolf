### Wednesday 30 March

This is the last evening, & L. is packing, & Iâ€™m not in the mood for writing, but feel superstitiously that I should like to read something actually written in Cornwall. By looking over my left shoulder I see gorse yellow against the Atlantic blue, running up, a little ruffled, to the sky, today hazy blue. And weâ€™ve been lying on the Gurnardâ€™s Head, on beds of samphire among grey rocks with buttons of yellow lichen on them. How can I pick out the scene? You look down onto the semitransparent waterâ€”the waves all scrambled into white round the rocksâ€”gulls swaying on bits of seaweedâ€”rocks now dry now drenched with white waterfalls pouring down crevices. No one near us, but a coastguard sitting outside the house.

We took a rabbit path round the cliff, & I find myself a little shakier than I used to be. Still however maintaining without force to my conscience that this is the loveliest place in the world. It is so lonely. Occasionally a very small field is being ploughed, the men steering the plough round the grey granite rocks. But the hills & the cliffs have been given over as a bad job. There they lie graceful even in spite of all their stones & roughness, long limbed, stretching out to sea; & so subtly tinted; greys, all various with gleams in them; getting transparent at dusk; & soft grass greens; & then one night they burnt the heather at Tregerthen, the smoke rolling up over the crest, & flame shining. This we saw from Kaâ€™s. The Eagleâ€™s Nest stands up too much of a castle-boardinghouse to be a pleasant object; but considering the winds, firm roots are needed. Endless varieties of nice elderly men to be seen there, come for climbing.
