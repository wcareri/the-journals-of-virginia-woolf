### Monday 18 April

Just back from lunching with a Cabinet Minister. I mean, of course, Herbert Fisher. We think he asked us in order to apologise forâ€”everything. He said he had neither the physical force nor the combativeness to carry things through. He said he hated Parliament. A political life is dull, & wastes all oneâ€™s time he said; one is always listening to dull speeches, frittering time away. He leaves home at 10, gets back at 11 p.m. & then has a bundle of papers to go through. The upshot of it all was that he couldnâ€™t be blamed for his conduct about Ireland. And then he was careful to explain that the public is ridiculously in the dark about everything. Only the cabinet knows the true spring & source of things he said. That is the only solace of the work. A flood tide of business flows incessantly from all quarters of the world through Downing Street; & there are a few miserable men trying desperately to deal with it. They have to make tremendous decisions with insufficient evidence on the spur of the moment. Then he pulled himself up, & said, solemnly, that he is going to Geneva to initiate peaceâ€”disarmament. â€œYou are the great authority upon that, I understandâ€, he said to Leonard. Anyhow I confess it seemed to me, sitting opposite to Leonard in that brown ugly room with its autotypes of Dutch pictures & Aunt Mary on a donkey, that Leonard was an authority & Herbert a thin-shredded thread paper of a man, whose brain has been harrowed in to sandy streaks like his hair. Never was there a thinner lighter airier specimen I thought; his words without body, & his head cocked at a queer angle, & his hands gesticulating, & his eyes so blue, but almost vacant, & cheerful colourless words, slightly mannered & brushed up in conformity with some official standard of cultureâ€”I daresay Mr Balfour talks something like that. But after mouthing his meaning behold; it flew away like thistledown, & it appeared that this Cabinet Minister & representative of Great Britain in whose hands are armies & navies was dry & empty againâ€”& asking me colloquially whether I remembered Aunt Mary on the donkey, which I did. â€˜The donkey is too smallâ€™, I said â€˜And the horse has no ears,â€™ he added. â€˜Watts has come down in the worldâ€™ I said, feeling astonishingly young & juicy beside him.

â€œYes, he said. I daresay: But I feel that the man who painted that picture was a great manâ€”not a great painter, perhaps, but a great man.â€ After which he descended as usual to badinage about the arts; & praised a Mr Munnings: wonderful pictures of horses; landscapes in the 18th century style behind them. â€œThats what I likeâ€”the 18th century styleâ€”old Crome & Cotman. Well, Munnings is that styleâ€”worth going to the Royal Academy to seeâ€”quite a young fellowâ€”fought through the war.â€ But modern art he didnâ€™t care for; & we walked down Victoria Street to the House of Commons; & he said he was reading Southeyâ€™s Lettersâ€”â€œfirst rate reading. Thereâ€™s a beautiful description of winter. Now who are our promising litterateurs?â€ I said Joyce. Never heard of Joyce. So we parted, Herbert very amiable, grey & distinguished, in his pea-jacket, going to tackle the liquor bill, & envying us very much, he said, writing books at Richmond. And then we ran into Will Vaughan at the London Library, portly & hearty, & keeping up a laugh like an old sea-captains all the time he talked. Indeed, we had nothing to say.
