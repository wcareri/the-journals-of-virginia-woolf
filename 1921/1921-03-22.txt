### Tuesday 22 March

Here we are on the verge of going to Cornwall. This time tomorrowâ€”it is now 5.20â€”we shall be stepping onto the platform at Penzance, sniffing the air, looking for our trap, & thenâ€”Good God!â€”driving off across the moors to Zennorâ€”Why am I so incredibly & incurably romantic about Cornwall? Oneâ€™s past, I suppose: I see children running in the garden. A spring day. Life so new. People so enchanting. The sound of the sea at night. And now I go back â€œbringing my sheavesâ€â€”well, Leonard, & almost 40 years of life, all built on that, permeated by that: how much so I could never explain. And in reality it is very beautiful. I shall go down to Treveal & look at the seaâ€”old waves that have been breaking precisely so these thousand years. But I see I shall never get this said, & Lottie is chattering.

We had Eliot to dinner on Sunday & went to Love for Love, he & I in the Pit; L. upstairs, with a ticket from the New Statesman. Eliot & I had to drive in to Hammersmith in a taxi, having missed our train. We passed through dark market gardens. â€˜Missing trains is awfulâ€™ I said. â€œYes. But humiliation is the worst thing in lifeâ€ he replied. â€œAre you as full of vices as I am?â€ I demanded. â€œFull. Riddled with them.â€ â€œWeâ€™re not as good as Keatsâ€ I said. â€œYes we areâ€ he replied. â€œNo: we dont write classics straight off as magnanimous people do.â€ â€œWeâ€™re trying something harderâ€ he said. â€œAnyhow our work is streaked with badnessâ€ I said. â€œCompared with theirs, mine is futile. Negligible. One goes on because of an illusion.â€ He told me that I talked like that without meaning it. Yet I do mean it. I think one could probably become very intimate with Eliot because of our damned self conscious susceptibility: but I plunge more than he does: perhaps I could learn him to be a frog. He has the advantage of me in laughing out. He laughed at Love for Love: but thinking I must write about it I was a little on the stretch. We saw George Moore talking to Eddie Marsh, on some steps; a little obese, dim eyed, weak, inconsiderable. I was disappointed. There was no rakish poll to be seen. As for Clive he dresses as effectively as any beauty, & poses like someone at a first night. Mary was there. â€œTomâ€, she said, â€œyou must come and see the boat race.â€ Well, these womenâ€™s emotions, which I donâ€™t trouble to write out, are amusing; not very serious in my case. Then we met Nessa & Duncan, as shabby as old moths, making off home together. I bought a pair of boots yesterday for 33/6, which were made for another & fit me precisely. The truth is my foot is shaped like a snake. I have muddled away these 3 days, as far as writing is concerned, & intend to write nothing in Cornwall; but to read the classics. Candide: Shakespeareâ€”historical plays: Adolphe: Keatsâ€™ Letters: Thomas Hardy: & perhaps Hudibras. I shall find some old biography or 10th rate novel & read only that. Never mind.

Leonard is an impulsive man. He has lent Monks House to Mrs Martin. She goes there tomorrow. As she is a complete zany, has no husband, no control over anything, & floats down stream, I see no reason why she should ever get out of Monkâ€™s House. How are we to turn her out? And somehow I see her laying eggs diffusively all over the gardenâ€”an amorphous jelly of a woman, German too.

I had tea with Nessa yesterday & heard a pack of troubles. Poor Ann has inherited Karinâ€™s disease of the ear & must be operated on. They have notice to leave Charleston. And Clive, as she remarks, is not much help at Easter. Adrian came in to tell me that Desmond wanted me, to demand my article instantly. Adrian wears a short red-brown moustache, reminding me in a ghastly way of the hair that grows after death. So distinguished I always think him, but (to me) so repressive.

As for other news, I think I have never said that Lytton stays at home with Lady Strachey, who has taken to fainting on the floor.
