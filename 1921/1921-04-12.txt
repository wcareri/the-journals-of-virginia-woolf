### Tuesday 12 April

I must hurriedly note more symptoms of the disease, so that I can turn back here & medicine myself next time. Well; Iâ€™d worn through the acute stage, & come to the philosophic semi depressed, indifferent, & spent the afternoon taking parcels round the shops, going to Scotland Yard for my purse, when L. met me at tea & dropped into my ear the astonishing news that Lytton thinks the String Quartet â€˜marvellousâ€™. This came through Ralph, who doesnâ€™t exaggerate, to whom Lytton need not lie; & did for a moment flood every nerve with pleasure, so much so that I forgot to buy my coffee & walked over Hungerford Bridge twanging & vibrating. A lovely blue evening too, the river sky colour. And then there was Roger who thinks Iâ€™m on the track of real discoveries, & certainly not a fake. And weâ€™ve broken the record of sales, so far. And Iâ€™m not nearly as pleased as I was depressed; & yet in a state of security; fate cannot touch me; the reviewers may snap; & the sales decrease. What I had feared was that I was dismissed as negligible.

Roger again last night, scraping at his woodcuts while I sewed; the sound like that of a large pertinacious rat. We live in stirring times. Here is Ralph saying that Michael Davies has enlisted to protect the country, against the miners, & McIver is offered Â£1 exs. by government for himself & car, which he will accept. Yet no oneâ€”so far as I knowâ€”really believes that we are in for anything. It will be tided over. Our cellars will be full; our larders too. Nothing is going to upset us. People in a century will say how terrible it all was. And I walked past Downing St yesterday & saw a few men in cabs, a few men with despatch boxes, orderly public watching, wreaths being laid on the Cenotaph. Lyttonâ€™s book already selling 5 thousand copies, & the weather perfect.
