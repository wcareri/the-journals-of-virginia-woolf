### Thursday 10 March

Mr Chancellor has been here trying to make us discontented with our offer for Suffieldâ€”not that it is an offer: we have stated terms; will take Â£1400. Now Chancellors say at auction we might get Â£17 or Â£1800. But this is doubtful; & an amusing example of the tug of war between business men, & the shady shifts they resort to to poach each others game.

For news, what is there? I lunched with Nessa & Duncan the other day, & dashed my pleasure by losing my Roman brooch. Duncan has a large proper studio with a gallery, a deserted place, very silent, off Haverstock Hill, where a murder might take place, or a dead body be found. On the contrary, they were very cheerful, having been to Cambridge, seen the Greek play, heard Roger lecture, & ravished their eyes on several beautiesâ€”for there are beauties now, not seekers after truth, as in my day.

Norton has descended. Bob, of course, muddled it all up. Norton can lunch at any rate at 46; & proposes to live there; yet is desperate; verging on suicidal; can talk of nothing but himself; & will, Nessa thinks, hang about them all like an old decomposing albatross. Thereâ€™s a new suggestion Dr who can make your hair curl, & unravel every knot in your nerves as far as 20 years backâ€”but Norton canâ€™t be made to face him. So Craig goes on rubbing in the suggestion that Norton canâ€™t work; & he canâ€™t work; & now proposes to get employment with the Webbs. What other news? Singularly little in the way of letters this week, not that I ever write them.
