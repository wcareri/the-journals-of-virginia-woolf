### Monday 19 September

Miss Green has been for the week end, & a more comfortable guest does not exist. One need not bother about her; yet, at meal times, she proves brisk & fresh. Her father was a professor, or teacher, of geology at Oxford. Her mother a Unitarian, & a liberal, with a great admiration for Gladstone. When Minna was 9 her father died. She has been secretary to Lady St. Davids.

â€œI consider you as my childâ€ said Ly St D, & underpaid her. Then to Beerbohm Tree for 3 weeks. He walked about the room, behaved like Malvolio, & discoursed to an invisible audience about life. Minna found this trying, especially as it took place late at night in the dome of His Majesties. He used to say â€œAm I to give this autograph?â€â€”Then she was with Heinemann. But his lack of courage annoyed her; he was afraid to publish Norman Angell; &, not having a penny in the world, Minna was too good a pacifist to stayâ€”So she went on to the U.D.C. In this way she has lived all over England; & is fearfully independentâ€”marches about, protected by her extreme plainness, unmolested, & unnoticed; yet has a strong will of her own; & observes, & wonâ€™t be put upon. She is one of that regiment of the wage earning womenâ€™s republic. She eats up everything on her plate, very thoroughly; does not keep accounts; spends nothing on dress, & I daresay subscribes to the Russian Famine Fund. Now she is off to spend a fortnight in Germanyâ€”a country which she thinks very beautiful. I said there were too many signposts & plaster statues. She would have none of it. But then her thick legs, laced boots, wooden face, flaxen hair (scanty) & red cheeks, would be respectable there; ludicrous in Italy or France.
