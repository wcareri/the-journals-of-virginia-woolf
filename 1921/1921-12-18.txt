### Sunday 18 December

Here it is practically the end of the year, & more pages left blank than seems to me altogether wholesome. But my diary dwindles, perversely enough, when the stuff for it is most abundant. There was Roger here for tea & dinner yesterday; the day before I had to go plundering the shops for presents after tea (we have tea at 4 now to suit Ralph). The day before, Thursday, I had to put in semicolons to my Hen James article while talking to Ralph over my shoulder & then to rush to catch a train to Hampstead to dine with Brett & Gertler. Tomorrow we dine with Adrian. But in thus accumulating facts I am shirking my business of describing them. Well, Brettâ€™s salon need give no one the gooseflesh. I thought to myself, as I sat in my black dress by the anthracite stove in the studio that if Sydney, Kot, Gerder, Brett, Miln, & Sullivan with one voice denounced me, I should sleep the sounder. It is a group without teeth or claws. For one thing they have no faith in each other. In my day groups were formidable because they coalesced. But there was Gertler dismissing Sydney as an old bore (not to his face) & Kot detecting faults, â€œyes very serious faultsâ€”no you misunderstand my characterâ€”I do not find fault with the people I really likeâ€”I never discuss themâ€”â€ & Miln is a moonfaced cipherâ€”what they call, justly, a quiet manâ€”& Sullivan is too much of the indiarubber faced, mobile lipped, unshaven, uncombed, black, uncompromising, suspicious, powerful man of genius in Hampstead type for my taste. Anyhow, the hours wore rather thin, & Gertler was the chief stimulant. He has grown fat; his hair stands upright; he has the same tightly buttoned face as of oldâ€”little eyesâ€”hard cheeksâ€”something small & concentrated about him which makes me repeat, however foolhardily, that I donâ€™t believe he can paint a pictureâ€”though his pertinacity would bore holes in granite, if that helped. However to balance this, I must add that heâ€™s more spontaneous than most: has an alert mind, & is, I should say, in defiance of Ralph, something of a Puritan. Sydney shocks him. Sydney says â€œNow what do you do about womenâ€™s society? Do you copulate with your models?â€ And again, â€œDid you think that Marg made a bloody fool of herself the other night?â€

Brett is soft, docile, & small. She danced before Q. Victoria.

Rogerâ€™s visit went off specially well. I mean we are grown rather intimate, & sit talking at our easeâ€”practically of everything. This was not so a year ago. It is partly the good effect of having friends in commonâ€”not, as used to be the way, my seeing Roger alone, while Leonard stayed at home. I see in this one of the good effects of middle age. Roger had Benda in his pocket & read a passage aloud which started us off, & Leonard made him stand to his guns; & then on to all the usual things. Roger grudges every minute now that he doesnâ€™t paint. So we reflected upon these strange, on the whole merciful, dispensations, by which Roger always sees masterpieces ahead of him & I see great novelsâ€”We have our atmosphere of illusion, without which life would be so much duller than it is. Here am I at last starting on Hardy, & saying to myself, not for the first time, This at least is going to be first rate. We discussed Proust, & Clive &, since I like to trace these things, I was interested to see how far apart Roger & Clive are now compared with what they wereâ€”Roger suspects Cliveâ€™s friendships: had not yet been to see him.

And before this Rosalind & Arnold Tâ oynbee appeared with a kitten & the manuscript of her new novel. She is a wisp of a woman, with the eyes of a kind sensitive thoughtful nature, which canâ€™t, I am afraid, produce much in the way of art. She canâ€™t by any possibility write a long book, she said; & she only made Â£10 by her last; & altogether she seems rather shelless & defenceless, though she is Gilbert Murrayâ€™s daughter. Iâ€™m glad at least Iâ€™m not that, with a dash of aristocracy to refine still further.

Our luck seems, at last, to be in again. At least these are all good signs. Allison is tired of farming: the Americans want to have L.â€™s Contemporary articles; 37 copies of Tchekov were ordered yesterday; & the Labour Monthly wants L. to write another article. If each of these letters had been written the other way round we should have been very dismal, so we ought to be very cheerful. With luck we may have Â£400 instead of Â£250; & we might buy a motor car; & we might buy the meadow; & we might run up another lodge, & we might take in a new strip of garden. & so on & so on.
