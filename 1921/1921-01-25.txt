### Tuesday 25 January

Here have I waited 25 days before beginning the new year; & the 25 is, not unfortunately my 25th, but my 39th birthday; & weâ€™ve had tea, & calculated the costs of printing Tchekov; now L. is folding the sheets of his book, & Ralph has gone, & I having taken this out of the press proceed to steal a few minutes to baptise it. I must help L. & canâ€™t think of a solemn beginning. Iâ€™m at a crisis in Jacob: want to finish in 20,000 words, written straight off in a frenzy. And I must pull myself together to bring it off. Tomorrow we iniâ tiâ ate the Cock Club, Sanger, Pippa, Molly Hamilton & Sidney dining â€˜along sideâ€™ of us. Lytton has asked to dedicate Victoria to me, which pleases me, & I stipulate, from vanity, for my name in full.

Then, if I had time, I could write a new chapter in Cliveâ€™s life. Spring has miraculously renewed herself. Pink almond blossoms are in bud. Callow birds crow. In short, heâ€™s out of love & in love, & contemplated eloping with a Spaniard in a motor car. â€œBut after all, I said to myself as I walked back, I like to think of my book & my armchair. Itâ€™s terrible, terrible. I canâ€™t give up my old friends after all.â€ The dusky one lives in Chelsea, has a car, no husband, children, & is beautiful as the Southern night. No one has ever seen her, & she, to her credit, has never heard of Maynard Keynes. We speculate about Maryâ€™s attitude. Poor parrokeet fallen off her perch, or left to preen & prink in solitude. Then weâ€™re just over the crest of a Sydney swell: such a solemn heaving one; the poor manâ€™s bosom all clouded & turgid owing to Murry; who sits at Hampstead promulgating doctrines, & caring not at all that S. seriously thinks of leaving wife & children. â€œI have no solid core. I am unlike everyone else, & probably more unhappy.â€ Indeed his bloodhound eyes drooped & almost spilt tears. We talked sense into him, & the inflated tumour burst. He came down happier to breakfast; & a little less certain of the worth of Murryâ€™s goodness. What Murryâ€™s goodness amounts to Iâ€™m puzzled to say. K.M. (as the papers call her) swims from triumph to triumph in the reviews; save that Squire doubts her geniusâ€”so, Iâ€™m afraid, do I. These little points, though so cleanly collected, donâ€™t amount to much, I think. I read her at the Club last night; then went with L. to the Grand Guignol.
