### Saturday 5 February

Jealousy or ambition has won the day, & Iâ€™ve just had my first Russian lesson & mortgaged my time to the extent of doing three lessons weekly. L. is mumbling Russian as I write. Have I done a great deal of work in pursuance of my vow? Books begin to drop in, & so long as I can do them every other week I rather like the relief from Jacob. I am beginning the last lap; & it is a sprint towards the end, difficult to keep up.

We had the Memoir Club on Wednesday. Clive & Maynard read; both elaborate & polished, Clive mellow & reminiscent about Mrs Raven Hill (he had her 2 years after his marriage, & for the last time in 1914. She is now imbecile. This was a surprise to me. She coincided with his attachment to me then. But she was a voluptuary. He was not â€˜in loveâ€™.) Maynard, of course, was the solid piece of the evening, so long indeed that we had to leave before the end. I was a little bored by the politics, & a good deal impressed by the method of character drawing. Rosy Wemyss, illegitimate descendant of William the 4th came out very well,â€”sitting in mock despair at the conference where he presided, unable to answer a question until Maynard had scribbled it for him. Then Melchior; & his room, where the three clerks refused to leave off playing the piano. â€œSmoking isnâ€™t allowed until 5â€ they said; â€œThis is the German revolutionâ€ was Melchiorâ€™s comment. â€œI was rather in love with himâ€ said Maynard. I think he meant it seriously, though we laughed. Then L.G. at the table, overwhelmed by his own eloquenceâ€”denouncing Klotz & â€˜gooldâ€™ making a gesture as of a miser sweeping up money bags. All this was very brilliantly told. Mary was there; & I note that one likes her better, partly for showing fight; partly, perhaps, for not being the mistress any longer. I am in hot water for having told Sydney, which I did deliberately, without malice, as conversation, thinking it allowed. Oh what a goose Sydney is! What does he do but march up & congratulate Clive in front of everyone!
