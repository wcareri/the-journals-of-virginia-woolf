My evening being ruined by GravÃ© as usualâ€”I mean by non-GravÃ©â€”I mean she said she was coming at 6 & its 6.30â€”I may as well wreak my temper, write out my fidgets, in this book. Such is the constitution of my brain that I can settle to nothing if Iâ€™m waiting. This doesnâ€™t want settling to. Havenâ€™t I schooled my diary well? It takes what it can get & is thankful.

I sat in Gordon Square yesterday for an hour & a half talking to Maynard. Sometimes I wish I put down what people say instead of describing them. The difficulty is that they say so little. Maynard said he liked praise; & always wanted to boast. He said that many men marry in order to have a wife to boast to. But, I said, its odd that one boasts considering that no one is ever taken in by it. Its odd too that you, of all people, should want praise. You & Lytton are passed beyond boastingâ€”which is the supreme Triumph. There you sit & say nothing. I love praise, he said. I want it for the things Iâ€™m doubtful about. Then we got upon publishing, & the Hogarth press; & novels. Why should they explain what bus he took? he asked. And why shouldnâ€™t Mrs Hilbery be sometimes the daughter of Katherine. Oh its a dull book, I know, I said; but donâ€™t you see you must put it all in before you can leave out. The best thing you ever did, he said, was your Memoir on George. You should pretend to write about real people & make it all upâ€”I was dashed of course. (& oh dear what nonsenseâ€”for if George is my climax Iâ€™m a mere scribbler). What else did we talk about? He was going to some official dinner. He gets Â£120 for an articleâ€”
