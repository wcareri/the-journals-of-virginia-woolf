### Sunday 13 March

Well our terms for Suffield have been accepted of course; & of course we feel, or I feel, slightly defraudedâ€”great nonsense, as we are sure of our money this way, save on the auction, & at most could only have made another Â£150, I suppose. Still it was the gamblerâ€™s chance that I liked. People called Turner have bought it, old & deaf, which appears to be necessary should you live at Suffield.

We dined with the Sangers ÎµahyÎµpob on Friday. No one there, or came in afterwards, but Molly MacCarthy; & all our grey heads over the fire made me feel a little greyheaded. We discussed death, a sore subject with Dora, I suspect; one of her morbidities. She cant face it. But then death, as I made out for myself at the age of 12, coming at the end of illness is altogether different from death as one sits over the fire. Charlie a little silent as this went forward, as at the display of a wifes complexes husbands mostly are. Molly was very deaf, resigned, but intermittently deaf only. Charlie not very encouraging about Russianâ€”at least he says the literature is scarcely worth the trouble. Nothing but the great novels, & these adequately translated. But I doubt whether any English pupil can judge of this. A person with my taste shut up in a library might unearth treasures. Anyhow this is provision for old age. Also we talk of Russia next yearâ€”also language helps one to understand writers atmosphere, like seeing their country. And then Kot will pull us through; & vanity urges. Kot, poor honest somehow wounded man let out by chance that Katherine lost 3 ms books he of Tchehovâ€™s letters. He patiently sets to work to write them out again. Unless she has some very good excuse this seems to me wanton cruelty on her part. She is a tidy methodical woman. How could one lose 3 books lent one by a man who gets his bread by writing? But she never abused Kot; as he does them.

Time is a good deal broken just now by the journey to Manchester next Wednesday. We come back on Friday, then to Cornwall on Wednesday. So what am I to write? What am I to read? I have scribbled an article for Desmond; tomorrow I distemper the kitchen rose pink & leaf green. I canâ€™t begin Dorothy Wordsworth, nor start Jacobâ€™s travels to the East. Still, I generally put in my pen & pick out something.

In the way of history the Germans have gone back to Germany. People go on being shot & hanged in Ireland. Dora described mass going on all day in Dublin for some wretched boy killed early on Monday morning. The worst of it is the screen between our eyes & these gallows is so thick. So easily one forgets itâ€”or I do. For instance why not set down that the Maids of Honour shop was burnt out the other night? Is it a proof of civilisation to envisage suffering at a distanceâ€”& then the faculty of seeing that laws matterâ€”the constitution of Cheko-Slovakia for exampleâ€”is that an important one? Anyhow very little bestowed on me.

Eliot dines here tonight, alone, since his wife is in a nursing home, not much to our regret. But what about Eliot? Will he become â€˜Tomâ€™? What happens with friendships undertaken at the age of 40? Do they flourish & live long? I suppose a good mind endures, & one is drawn to it & sticks to it, owing to having a good mind myself. Not that Tom admires my writing, damn him.

Nessa has influenza; slightly; & Iâ€™m glad to see how solicitous dear old Duncan is, waiting on her, & taking thought for her, better I think than Clive ever did. That little man postpones his poems till the autumn, meaning, I daresay, to add one or two in praise of his dusky lady. I am told that poor Moll Hutch, found the separation intolerable, & has come back to platonic intercourse; strictly platonic. How the pismire survives the tug of war; or whether he sucks pleasure from it I cannot say. Anyhow he dines out nightly, â€˜not been in, I suppose, since the night you dined with us,â€™ he boasts; & mixes with society â€˜which, thank God, he doesnâ€™t bring hereâ€™ says Nessa. I trace some anxiety on her part for his welfare. Perhaps one doesnâ€™t like the father of oneâ€™s children to dissolve into pure lust & gluttony & pleasure & vainglory. She hopes, anyhow, that he will return to Charleston this summer & write his book on Civilisation. His views on that subject will be on lines agreeable with her present life, I suppose. Will the lady have taught him a fresh version of the old story? I fancy when he began the book, 15 years ago, he was a Moorite. Well, I suppose there are Moors in Spain. Now the light fades (though I am just becoming brilliant) & I must tackle the aspects & the Labour party programmeâ€”one of L.â€™s triumphs.
