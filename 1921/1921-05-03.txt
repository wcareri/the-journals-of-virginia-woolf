Hamilton Fyfe in the Daily Mail says that Leonardâ€™s story P. & S. will rank with the great stories of the world. Am I jealous? Only momentarily. But the odd thing isâ€”the idiotic thingâ€”is that I immediately think myself a failureâ€”imagine myself peculiarly lacking in the qualities L. has. I feel fine drawn, misty, attenuated, inhuman, bloodless & niggling out trifles that donâ€™t move people. â€˜Limboâ€™ is my sphere; so they say in the Daily News. Then Romer Wilson has brought out a novelâ€”to which Squire will certainly give the Hawthornden prize, thus robbing Katherine of it: so I have some cause for pleasure. I write this purposely, to shame it out of me. A full stop in Jacob, owing partly to depression. But I must pull together & finish it off. I canâ€™t read it as it is.

We had Oliver & Saxon to dinner on Sunday; & I went to tea with Nessa on Saturday; & yesterday we were in London at the New Statesman office: & I bought Eliot on Prose; & Romer Wilson;â€”all of which I note to put off doing my Russian; I suppose: for I see I am going to say nothing sensible or witty or profound. And yet I comfort myself with the reflection that thereâ€™s no knowing what wonâ€™t interest old Virginia one of these days.
