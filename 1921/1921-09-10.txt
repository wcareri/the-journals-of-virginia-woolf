### Saturday 10 September

My handwriting is getting detestable. But I have done with fidgets long ago, & sat in the sun at Bishopstone, & at Chalvington, & at Telscombe Cliffs. I recovered, & we took to seeing housesâ€”without the least success, except that the rides to & from were successful. My only grievance is that one runs off the edge of the lovely into hideousness too soon. Newhaven is spot & rash & pimple & blister; with the incessant motor cars like active lice. Much more important (to me) than anything else, was my recovery of the pen; & thus the hidden stream was given exit, & I felt reborn. I started an article upon the obscure, & should have finished it today, according to calculations, had not Lytton come; & it is impossible to write, unless the brain is unstirred completely by anything save the usual routine. However I gained by the exchange. We talked & talked; & always dislodged some new nugget, the deeper we went. Of course, his friendships are now, as mine are, fearfully important to himâ€”all the more, as I daresay I have said, because he has been offered all the thin shining substitutes which his fame procuresâ€”ladies & lords without stint. But what did we talk about? (oddly enough I could write more freely after tea: this is the colourless morning hour, the mist driving across the flats, & rain come at last on the sudden wind.) First we skirmish round with trivialities; next we ascertain how we stand; we recognise that our position is sound; then begin on our writing; then on booksâ€”but its all easy enough, & interspaced. He is going to write a play, â€œI am going to meet my Waterlooâ€â€”that is to say he is going to have a shot at the creative. If that fails, he dooms himself to history for everâ€”perhaps a history of English literature. Writing is an agony, we both agreed. Yet we live by it. We attach ourselves to the breath of life by our pens. The exciting illusion begins. Clive says we pour out brandy & so make romance, which does not exist. Clive came suddenly into view yesterday, in white flannel trousers, & open flannel shirt. He seemed bursting through; & his neck a series of rings of fat, like the Chess Queenâ€™s body. A dowager would hide this with a dog collar. And the heat had sopped his hair, so that he looked debauched & rubbed by dissipation. He was obviously nervous, & instead of boasting of his triumphs, as he did a few months back, almost deprecated them. â€œDid Lytton think the great world dull? Was he going to give it up? Well, perhaps it is too dullâ€”One should live in the country & workâ€ Iâ€™m glad to say that the repentant mood gave out; & up bubbled his natural man. The New Republicâ€”Americaâ€”moneyâ€”&c &c &câ€”

I see that I shirk giving an account of Lyttonâ€™s talkâ€”for one thing, I dont like the appearance of writing what will interest Mr Gosse or Mrs Asquith in 50 yearsâ€™ time. Then, it needs a screw of the brain. I ought to note, though, for my good, that I must get out of the way of minding what people say of my writing. I am noted for it. It breeds discomfort. For instance, when Lytton was telling me of Max Beerbohmâ€™s tastes in literature, he thought it necessary to explain that Max had not read meâ€”which was uncomfortable. My dislikes of M.H. is attributed to her low opinion of my writing. So I must give up drawing attention to â€˜my writingâ€™. One slips into the way of it; & a little slip is magnified soon. But that was the one awkward moment. In the old days there would have been a thousand.
