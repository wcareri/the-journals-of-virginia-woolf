### Tuesday 9 August

Then, as I say, there was Roger, with 20 holes in his teeth to be stopped; & I thought his teeth were all of soulless bone, as some of mine are; & now I hear that he has mercurial poisoning from these stoppings in Paris. Thereâ€™s no doubt we are a weakly set of people; but then they i.e. Nessa &c have had a splendid summer of dissipation. I dont envy it: I dont want it; far far away it seems; I want nothing but quiet & an active brain. Indeed I am reading Hardy for my famous articleâ€”the one Iâ€™m always talking about. I ransack public libraries & find them full of sunk treasure. Yet I have a worm of uncertainty moving at the foundations of this pleasant lifeâ€”Allison, when we asked him to cut a branch in the field, replied that he has sold the field for building purposes to a friend. So I shall have Jack Squire in a poetical villa within a hundred yards. As it is I see Shanksâ€™ paper stand at his cottage window when I walk down my garden path; & cultivated voices & a cultivated dog barking wake us on Sunday mornings. The truth is, Rodmell is a colony for Georgian poets, & though I am all for letting live, & not reading their works, it is hard & indeed intolerable that I should have to let them live next door to me. We have even answered an advertisement about a house near Arundel; & paced out a meadow with a wonderful view, & imagined a house there. But L. says we are too old to build a house.

If one goes into the matter, & considers the good of the majority, Allinsonâ€™s descent upon Rodmell is probably a benefit. He puts up gates & hedges, mends cottages, ploughs fields, owns a telephone, gives teas in the barn, & I suppose finds work & does kindnesses when old Stacey would have been stingy & too much of a rustic to imagine a better state of things. Old Stacey it is said drank himself to death, & had to be buried straight awayâ€”which will not happen to Allinson. However for my purposes farmers who drink, & lounge about like Mr Smith, muddy & ruddy & obsolete are far preferable to Allinson who looks as if he had been dressed by one of the advertisers in his own Field.
