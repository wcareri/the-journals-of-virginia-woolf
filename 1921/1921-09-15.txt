### Thursday 15 September

It is the loveliest of eveningsâ€”still; the smoke going up straight in the quarry; the white horse & strawberry coloured horse feeding close together; the women coming out of their cottages for no reason, & standing looking; or knitting; the cock pecking in the midst of his hens in the meadow; starlings in the two trees; Asheham fields shorn to the colour of white corduroy; Leonard storing apples above my head. & the sun coming through a pearly glass shade; so that the apples which still hang are palish red & green; the church tower a silver extinguisher rising through the trees. Will this recall anything? I am so anxious to keep every scrap, you see.

I have been dabbling in K.M.â€™s stories, & have to rinse my mindâ€”in Dryden? Still, if she were not so clever she couldnâ€™t be so disagreeable.

A letter from Morgan this morning. He seems as critical of the East as of Bloomsbury, & sits dressed in a turban watching his Prince dance, quite unimpressed. He is not impressed by Q.Vict. either. Flimsy, he says, compared with Macaulay, which was perhaps what I meant.

There is one woman of genius among the cows. She has decided to leave the herd & eat the branches on the fallen tree. She has now one disciple. The rest utterly condemn. She is a Roger Fry. I heard from Roger the other day, all in a hubblebubble about Murryâ€™s sneering pin-pricking article. He is so angry that he can talk of nothing else, (the cow has 2 disciples). We must go on doing what we like in the desert Roger says, & let Murry climb the heights, as he certainly will.

The birds are moving about like nets full of fish; they turn sideways & vanish; sideways again, & become full of black spots.
