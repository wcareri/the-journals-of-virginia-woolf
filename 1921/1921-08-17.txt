### Wednesday 17 August

To while away the time till L. comes in, from London, Fergusson, office, &c, I may as well scribble. Really I think my scribbling is coming back. Here I have spent the whole day, off & on, making up an articleâ€”for Squire perhaps, because he wants a story, & because Mrs Hawkesford has told Mrs Thomsett that I am one of the, if not the, cleverest women in England. Itâ€™s not nerve power so much as praise that has lacked, perhaps.

Yesterday I was seized with the flux, as the Bible has it, Dr Vallence was fetched, came after dinner, & paid a call. I wish I could write down his conversationâ€”A mild, heavy lidded, little elderly man, son of a Lewes Dr, has always lived here, existing on a few broad medical truths learnt years ago, which he applies conscientiously; he can speak French, as it were, in words of one syllable. As both L. & I knew a good deal more than he did we got upon general topicsâ€”old Verrall, & how he starved himself purposely to death. â€œI could have had him sent away,â€ said Dr. V meditatively â€œHe had been away once. His sisters away to this dayâ€”quite crazy, I believeâ€”A bad familyâ€”very bad. I sat with him in your sitting room. We had to sit right into the chimney to get warm. I tried to interest him in chess. No. He didnâ€™t seem able to take an interest in anything. But he was too oldâ€”too weak. I couldnâ€™t send him away.â€ So he starved himself to death, pottering about this garden.

Crossing his knees, & touching his little moustache meditatively now & then, V. then asked me if I did anything? (He thought me a chronic invalid, & fine lady). I said I wroteâ€”â€œWhat novels?â€”light things?â€ Yes, novels. â€œI have another lady novelist among my patientsâ€”Mrs Dudedny. Iâ€™ve had to buck her upâ€”to fulfil a contract, a contract for a new novelâ€”She finds Lewes very noisy. And then we have Marion Crawfordâ€¦. But Mr Dudedny is the puzzle king. Give him any puzzleâ€”heâ€™ll tell you the answer. He makes up the sort of puzzles shops print on their menus. He writes columns in the papers about puzzles.â€

â€œDid he help to answer puzzles in the war?â€ I asked.  
â€œWell I dont know about that. But a great many soldiers wrote to himâ€”the puzzle king.â€ Here he crossed his legs the opposite way. Finally he went, & invited L. to join the Lewes chess club, which I should very much like to attend myself, these glimpses into different groups always fascinating me intolerably, for I shall never join the party of Dr Vallence & the puzzle king.

I shall never â€¦ has a kind of meaning, alas. For L. has been to see Allison, & there is no doubt that our fate is the worst possible. Ted Hunter is going to build his cottage, so far as we can tell, right against the orchard wall. He is going to make a proper road, & so far as I can see, the flats will be untenable. What to do we cannot decide. And this just as we were getting settled in to our likingâ€”& with the added bitterness that we might, twice over, have bought the field & the terrace & saved the loveliest of views for ever.
