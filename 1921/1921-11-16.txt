Can I make out the Waterlowâ€™s tragedy from this telegraphic scrap? I see I scribbled too quick to put in the quotation marks. Anyhow this was what Molly said the other day, & as I have a collection of Sydneyana I add this. I ought to be about to set off to the Wigmore Hall to hear Bach: & nature has intervened; & I am, with my usual economy, asking myself how I can get the utmost possible pleasure out of my evening, which I spend alone, since L. is dining with the Webbs, to meet Fabians. Shall I read King Lear? Do I want such a strain on the emotions? I think I do. It is pouring; but we say Thank God it is warmer. It has been freezing for a week. We go to bed under red blankets, quilts, fur coats; & I cant get up till I hear the quarter struck. But now, as I say, it is raining. I take in the Westminster Gazette. For some politics are beginning to interest me, as I suppose they interest City menâ€”like a football match. One might become a virulent Socialistâ€”or a Conservative? It is a game. I mean by that that I donâ€™t think of ends (nor does any one else) but of means. The American offer about the Navy has set me off on this. I get no letters nowadays, so I read my paper. Cliveâ€™s poems have gone today to the Reviewers; our publishing day being December the 1st. Did I describe the advent of the Press? Nelly panic struck, thinking it would come through the kitchen floor. How do you invent these fears? I asked her. Indeed, if she were as ingenious in her cooking we should do well. â€œDonâ€™t go & take the wire off the larder windows, for goodness sakeâ€ she said, â€œor we shall be having robbers.â€

But never have we been so peaceful domestically for so long.

What other news is there? I have left out everyone for a monthâ€”everything. How Lady Cromer came to tea, in a charwomanâ€™s bonnet, & cut great chunks of bread for herself. â€œMy dear Virginia, when one is old one sees how absurd it is to think that sort of thingâ€”I know my nieces accuse me of itâ€”& I never give it a thought.â€ This was when I told her how Kitty Maxse was worldly, & wished me to marry into South Kensington. She spoke with that old mellow worldly benignancy, as if all her thoughts were easy & shabby & loose, which I find so charming. In my house I like her better than in hers. She is trying to keep her son not a snob: â€œbut heâ€™ll get among those kinds of peopleâ€ she said. The Barings were horrified when she sent him to Winchester. â€œYou send a boy to school in order to make friendsâ€ they said â€œThe right sortâ€.
