### Monday 31 January

Just back from Tidmarsh, from the Club, from Harrisonâ€™s, from losing two books on a bus. Lytton keeps his books amazingly tidy, like books on the stage. We slept Friday night with Philip at the farm; wet of course; but dryness & comfort within. A hot bath, linen sheets (oh what a housekeeper Iâ€™m becoming!) Poor Philipâ€”so I feel himâ€”worn & dogged, but not much life in him. He is kept at it perpetually, now paying men, now tending a cow with ringworm. We walked to pay woodmen after breakfast through the slim green trees, fading away rather mysteriously, striping the view with their green. The woodmen had their fire in a ditch & were drinking tea. So round to the farm. The cows henpeck the bull, & donâ€™t allow his attentions. Philip drove us over, & we sat in the drawing room, lacking life as peopleâ€™s empty rooms do. L. much depressed on Sunday morning & working out how many hours remained, before breakfast. Indeed, Saturday night was hard going. Lytton lapsed into gentle indifference, tired, depressed perhaps. Carrington I think grows older, & her doings are of the sort that age. L. told Murryâ€™s story, & we rated him one of those born queer. Carrington had other versions of his machinations with other hypnotised rabbits. Still even this didnâ€™t keep us going; & middle ageâ€”am I not 39?â€”brings I fear its dependence upon warmth & books & easy chairs. Next day was better, though of course one never has a box in a strange house, & about 11.30 my eyes feel rough & sore with gazing at the fire. But it was better, undoubtedly. Câ arrington & Râ alph. tactfully made out lists of summer flowers in the dining room.

â€œYou ought to have dedicated Vic. to C.â€ I said.  
Oh dear noâ€”weâ€™re not on those terms at all.  
â€œOttoline will be enraged.â€  
Yes, he thought she might be.

The ms. was there, & once I began reading it, I couldnâ€™t stop; or rather had to stop myself. Talk of going to Italy at Easter with the party butâ€”One of the â€˜butsâ€™ is the Press. I sometimes think that L. & I are settling in too soundly. And now, am I to learn Russian with him & Kot? If he can read it & solace his age with it I shall be furious. Talk about Keats & Wordsworth & C. & Pâ artridge. Lytton intends to live in Gordon Square permanently; & she is penniless; & P. is possessiveâ€”Perhaps after all, said Lytton, one oughtnâ€™t to allow these attachments. Our parents may have been right. & so we discussed our parents, & how Ly S. & Lytton (Lord) & Fitzj. would sit talking till 2 a.m.â€”but what about? So many things could never be said, & the remaining ones coloured by the abstinence. But Iâ€™m broiling as I write & canâ€™t settle to anything, & detest going away, & vow never to do it, but to work, work, workâ€”
