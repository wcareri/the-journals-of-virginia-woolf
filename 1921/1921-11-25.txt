### Friday 25 November

L.â€™s 41st birthday; & he has just caught a mouse in his hands. My apology for not writing is quite truthfully, the Hogarth Press. Rogerâ€™s woodcuts, 150 copies, have been gulped down in 2 days. I have just finished stitching the last copiesâ€”all but six. L. has been dismissed & taken on in another capacity by the same post; & now, this afternoon, he has been sketching a plan to Green, who is stranded, by which she may become our secretary. The Hogarth Press, you see, begins to outgrow its parents.

Last week end we spent at Tidmarsh. We must have talked our 12 hours, I supposeâ€”& I remember so little: for with old, worn, creased, shabby, intimate friends, it runs so easily; no rapids, or waterfalls; room for everything; & no damned brilliance. We laughed over the letter of the mad negress, I remember. And it was all very warm & the detailsâ€”such as cups & platesâ€”were exquisite. Carrington & Ralph have a gigantic 4 poster bed. The geese shriek in the early morning. You see, I canâ€™t remember a thingâ€”except that I was warm & communicative. Monday, though, I had a headache. I thought how foolish I had been to ask Richmond for books: & now I have 4 articles to write, & my brain is recovered, & I feel able to polish them all off, rather slap dash. But I wake in the night & think that I havenâ€™t written Hardy; & I shall open my paper & find him deadâ€”So we go on.

Last night Saxon dined here, & behold, here is a postcard, â€œMr & Mrs Patteson in 1831â€ which tells me a good deal. They were drowned. & Lord Houghton wrote a poem about em, & Saxon thought they were Prinseps; & this came of talking about the river Wye, & Barbara, & Sweden & the Finns, & Sydney & Desmond, & how no one will be read 100 years hence save Shaw; which Ralph said to me at tea today, you dont quite like. This is an unwonted subtlety on his part; though hs is apt to be more subtle when heâ€™s severe. He was 27 yesterday.
