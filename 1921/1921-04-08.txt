### Friday 8 April

10 minutes to eleven a.m. And I ought to be writing Jacobâ€™s Room;â€”I canâ€™t, & instead I shall write down the reason why I canâ€™tâ€”this diary being a kindly blank faced old confidante. Well, you see, Iâ€™m a failure as a writer. Iâ€™m out of fashion; old; shanâ€™t do any better; have no head piece; the spring is everywhere; my book out (prematurely) & nipped, a damp firework. Now the solid grain of fact is that Ralph sent my book out to the Times for review without date of publication in it. Thus a short notice is scrambled through to be in â€œon Monday at latestâ€, put in an obscure place, rather scrappy, complimentary enough, but quite unintelligent. I mean by that they donâ€™t see that Iâ€™m after something interesting. So that makes me suspect that Iâ€™m not. And thus I canâ€™t get on with Jacob. Oh & Lyttonâ€™s book is out & takes up three columns: praise, I suppose. I do not trouble to sketch this in order; or how my temper sank & sank till for half an hour I was as depressed as I ever am. I mean I thought of never writing any moreâ€”save reviews. To rub this in we had a festival party at 41 Gordon Square: to congratulate Lytton; which was all as it should be; but then he never mentioned my book, which I suppose he has read; & for the first time I have not his praise to count on. Now if Iâ€™d been saluted by the Lit. Sup. as a mystery & a riddle, I shouldnâ€™t mind; for Lytton wouldnâ€™t like that sort of thing, but if Iâ€™m as plain as day, & negligible?

Well, this question of praise & fame must be faced. (I forgot to say that Doran has refused the book in America). How much difference does popularity make? (I see pretty clearly, I may add, after a pause in which Lottie has brought in the milk & the sun has ceased to eclipse itself, that Iâ€™m writing a good deal of nonsense.) One wants, as Roger said very truly yesterday, to be kept up to the mark; that people should be interested, & watch oneâ€™s work. What depresses me is the thought that I have ceased to interest peopleâ€”at the very moment when, by the help of the press, I thought I was becoming more myself. One does not want an established reputation, such as I think I was getting, as one of our leading female novelists. I have still, of course, to gather in all the private criticism, which is the real test. When I have weighed this I shall be able to say whether I am â€˜interestingâ€™ or obsolete. Anyhow, I feel quite alert enough to stop, if Iâ€™m obsolete. I shanâ€™t become a machine, unless a machine for grinding articles. As I write, there rises somewhere in my head that queer, & very pleasant sense, of something which I want to write; my own point of view. I wonder, though, whether the feeling that I write for half a dozen instead of 1500 will pervert this?â€”make me eccentric,â€”no, I think not. But, as I said, one must face the despicable vanity which is at the root of all this niggling & haggling. I think the only prescription for me is to have a thousand interestsâ€”if one is damaged, to be able instantly to let my energy flow into Russian, or Greek, or the press, or the garden, or people, or some activity disconnected with my own writing.

But, honestly, I need not pull a very long face yet. Roger is staying with us. I think he has the nicest nature among usâ€”so open, sincere, & entirely without meanness; always generous, I think, & somehow hearty? He throws out a tremendous laugh. We went to the Bedford Music Hall last night, & saw Miss Marie Lloyd, a mass of corruptionâ€”long front teethâ€”a crapulous way of saying â€˜desireâ€™, & yet a born artistâ€”scarcely able to walk, waddling, aged, unblushing. A roar of laughter went up when she talked of her marriage. She is beaten nightly by her husband. I felt that the audience was much closer to drink & beating & prison than any of us. The coal strike is on. If I werenâ€™t crowded & hurried & distracted I would bring my Gordon Square gossip up to date. Juana Ganderilla has been seenâ€”a lady in the continental style, lovely, composed, simple, illiterate, emotional, going into trances.
