### Monday 21 February

To fill in an awkward space between Russian & dinner I take up this book. I ought to notice the long drawn spring afternoonâ€”tea easily by daylightâ€”Ralph able to set up 8 lines afterwards. Leonardâ€™s book will be printed by the end of the week perhaps. Massingham would be grateful if I would review D. Richardson for him. This amuses & slightly gratifies meâ€”especially as I refuse. We dined with Roger the other night; & found Sydney still a grudging reluctant convertâ€”still remembering his master, not his own man or Rogerâ€™s man. After dinner we turned over sketches in the studioâ€”not the pleasantest occupation for a cold night. Still old Roger has a quality of imagination which attracts meâ€”loose & warm & genuine, in contrast to the costive judicial Sydney, who was catching us out all the time. Sydney looks melancholy; is touched with grey. This gives him an air of distinction. I daresay his face has been one of his horrors. The looking glass always confirming the Apostles. Then we had Quentin & Julian for Sunday, packed Julian home with a temperature, & I put him to bed. Quentin ran in to see Angelica; came up saying she was better but very white. I liked to think of all this set going in the younger generation.

Saxon & Matthew for dinnerâ€”a successful combination. A tyrannous old mother has again devastated a daughters life. I see how easily one says of course the daughter must look after herâ€”of course she does, & gives up her dreamâ€”only of Genevaâ€”still it was a dream; & must now teach music in Maida Vale until the old tyrant dies.
