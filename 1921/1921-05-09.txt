Well, but I assure you, when Virginiaâ€™s old, no one will be talking of Romer Wilson. What a book! What a perfect example of the faux bon: every attitude, scene & word, I should say matched in the old word shop of the minor poets: never a single thing seen for herself, or dared; & yet by taking all the scenery & supplying the appropriate words she has Squire, Lynd, & Turner by the heel: another proof that what people dread is being made to feel anything: a certain kind of rhapsody makes them feel wild & adventurous; & they then make out that this is passion & poetryâ€”so thankful to be let off the genuine thing.

Yesterday I had tea with Lady Cromer, & I observe that sheâ€™s more Lady Cromer in her own drawing room than met casually in the street. Supported by her pretty chinzes, large airy rooms, family portraits by Watts & Sargentâ€”green stained wood, parquet floors, & young bumpkin Greek God dragoon of a son she is the English Countess again: thus rather a bore, Iâ€™ve come to think. Do I travel to Finchley Rd on a Sunday missing my chocolate cake merely to exchange views with Lady Cromer upon the niceness of the Bruce Richmonds, the charm of St Johnâ€™s Wood, the good qualities of the Frenchâ€”to hear Mr Keynes called â€˜very cleverâ€™ & Lytton Strachey â€˜very cleverâ€™ & myself very good to have come there? I cant get it right though. Time was when I thought this breeding & personality so distinguished & somehow celestial that it carried everything off. Now Iâ€™m more exacting: after all shes a little middle class: & then the personal goodness attitude restrains me. Doing good to peoples cooks if youâ€™re Lady Cromer seems to me an easy way to waste time agreeably. Barbara at the club today, stunned with the problem of life, thoroughly in for it, & scarcely able to deal with it, appeared to me more interestingâ€”thats it perhapsâ€”than Lady Cromer swimming over the waves. But sheâ€™s a nice woman: a character: beautiful too: so upright, firm, possessedâ€”& then that queer old way of bending her head on one side & falling half absentminded as she talks, looking out of the window; her voice so charmingly accented, her eyes half closed. I got home to find Mr Brenton of Barnes; & according to his code one asks people kindly after their health, & comes back to shake hands, very punctiliously; & the poor man is sunk cheeked, spotted, ugly: drab: yet L. says interesting, & he should judge having had 3 hours of him! An order for 25 stories of the East today from Sâ imkin & Mâ arshall.
