### Saturday 3 December

The diplomatic game is being played with considerable finesse, & I fancy I shanâ€™t meet Mary face to face (which comes, I think from Crossing the Bar) at all. I shanâ€™t cross that bar. Oddly enough, I feel sceptical & disillusioned about Clive and his doings. Iâ€™ve said so often enough out of spite; but this seems normal & true. His poor old brain has run down; as at 40 it very well may, if you drink too many cocktails, & sit too long with pretty Mrs Jowett. â€œCan it be Mr Jowettâ€™s fault, Madame?â€ said GravÃ© to me the other night. But I can pass no judgment upon the potency of Mr Jowett.

I dined with the Sangers last night, & enjoyed society. I wore my new black dress, & looked, I daresay, rather nice. Thatâ€™s a feeling I very seldom have; & I rather intend to enjoy it oftener. I like clothes, if I can design them. So Bertie Russell was attentive, & we struck out like swimmers who knew their waters. One is old enough to cut the trimmings & get to the point. Bertie is a fervid egoistâ€”which helps matters. And then, what a pleasureâ€”this mind on springs. I got as much out of him as I could carry.

â€œFor I should soon be out of my depthâ€ I said. I mean, I said, â€œall thisâ€ & I waved my hand round the room, where by this time were assembled Mr & Miss Amos, Rosalind Toynbee, a German, & Mrs Lucasâ€” â€œAll this is mush; & you can put a telescope to your eye & see through it.â€

â€œIf you had my brain you would find the world a very thin, colourless placeâ€ he said

But my colours are so foolish I replied.  
You want them for your writing, he said. Do you never see things impersonally?  
Yes. I see literature like that; Milton, that is.  
The Choruses in Samson are pure art, he said.  
But I have a feeling that human affairs are impure.  
God does mathematics. Thatâ€™s my feeling. It is the most exalted form of art.  
Art? I said.

Well theres style in mathematics as there is in writing, he said. I get the keenest aesthetic pleasure from reading well written mathematics. Lord Kelvinâ€™s style was abominable. My brain is not what it was. Iâ€™m past my bestâ€”& therefore, of course, I am now celebrated. In Japan they treated me like Charlie Chaplinâ€”disgusting. I shall write no more mathematics. Perhaps I shall write philosophy. The brain becomes rigid at 50â€”& I shall be 50 in a month or two. I have to make money.

Surely money is settled upon Russells by the country, I said.

I gave mine away years ago, to help promising young men who wanted to write poetry. From 28 to 38 I lived in a cellar & worked. Then my passions got hold of me. Now I have come to terms with my self: I am no longer surprised at what happens. I donâ€™t expect any more emotional experiences. I donâ€™t think any longer that something is going to happen when I meet a new person.

I said that I disagreed with much of this. Yet perhaps I did not expect very much to happen from talking to Bertie. I felt that he had talked to so many people. Thus I did not ask him to come hereâ€”I enjoyed it though a good deal; & got home & drank cocoa in the kitchen; & at 7.30 this morning traced a smell of shag in the house & found L. smoking his pipe by the kitchen fire, having come back safe. There was no meeting at Newcastle; a very small one at Manchester; rather more at Durham; but it was an absurd effort for such results, & L. has spoken to Miss Green to that effect severely.
