### Monday 12 September

It is true that we are alone again, but I cannot take up my pen, partly, I think, from superstition. I said goodbye to James & Alix at 9 this morning: therefore the whole day is contaminated. Freud has certainly brought out the lines in Alix. Even physically, her bones are more prominent. Only her eyes are curiously vague. She has purpose & security; but this may well be marriage. James remains precisely where he wasâ€”the only human being, Alix says, fit for the contemplative life, which is the highest. To look on comprehendingly is, she says, better than to create. But James claims no such eminence. He is the least ambitious of menâ€”not ambitious even of being a characterâ€”low, muted, gentle, modest. I suspect that his points show in the shadeâ€”which Alix certainly provides. I can fancy him very considerateâ€”selfish, of course, but not blind-selfish, not at all possessive, masculine, or dominating. The worst of it, as I should feel, is the greyness; nothing is worth doing; & his mind is capable enough to make out a case for anything, or against. I daresay his monotony is partly due to us. I fancy that in private he may be as gay as a small boy; perhaps they have a private language. Perhaps they go for treats. Perhaps he is the easiest & gayest of companions. Here he leapt on to my bed, directly I left it, & lay reading Janeâ€™s pamphlet. Thereâ€™s Noel, too, in the background. Noel, for James, as for Adrian, the unattainable romance, though she has married Jones or Richards, & is romantic no more. I caught Alix in profile & saw her old, masterly, advanced; always in the same coat & skirt, which indeed renews itself as if it were her natural covering.

Lytton, by the way, talked about sâ€”â€”y; & agreed that the bâ€™s are all namby pambies & sentimentalists. He is himself, he said. To be a b. one must be un-virile, unpossessive, very nice indeed, but tending to be sentimental. And then their tastes become so degraded.

I have finished the Wings of the Dove, & make this comment. His manipulations become so elaborate towards the end that instead of feeling the artist you merely feel the man who is posing the subject. And then I think he loses the power to feel the crisis. He becomes merely excessively ingenious. This, you seem to hear him saying, is the way to do it. Now just when you expect a crisis, the true artist evades it. Never do the thing, & it will be all the more impressive. Finally, after all this juggling & arranging of silk pocket handkerchiefs, one ceases to have any feeling for the figure behind. Milly thus manipulated, disappears. He overreaches himself. And then one can never read it again. The mental grasp & stretcâ h are magnificent. Not a flabby or slack sentence, but much emasculated by this timidity or consciousness or whatever it is. Very highly American, I conjecture, in the determination to be highly bred, & the slight obtuseness as to what high breeding is.

My dear Virginia,  
I should be sorry if Jack Squire were to suppose that he had seriously put me out; also, I canâ€™t swear to the phrase â€œput them rightâ€, though Iâ€™m sure it was nothing less impertinent; & so I hope you will say nothing about it. You donâ€™t guess how much I enjoyed my outing to Monks, or how much I like the society of you & your husband. You have created an atmosphere different from, perhaps better than, any I know. It seems odd, considering that we all started much alike in many ways; but I suppose, as they get older, people who start at all peculiar get more & more distinct. Anyhow, what I want to say is that the pleasure of seeing you both besides being great is particular. I am half tempted to suggest some sort of reunion either here or on the downs (weather permitting) for Fridayâ€”my birthdayâ€”only Mary will be with us and, owing to some absurd misunderstanding, she, I gather, is in your black books. So perhaps we had better wait till the following week.
