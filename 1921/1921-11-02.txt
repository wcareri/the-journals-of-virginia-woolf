### Wednesday 2 November

This was the very last thing I wrote at Rodmellâ€”so I suppose. And today is the 2nd of November; Wednesday to be exact; 10 to 7; & Dorothea just left the house for five years & a half. But I like old Kate; who cant see, & picks up butter in mistake for bread. Dorothea surely is a survival from the glacial period. I felt her great nose sawing up and down; she has very powerful mandibles; & little pig eyes. Very soon we should have got across each other. I felt come over me the old aversion. She persists; prods; brutally tramples; & speaks with a kind of measured sweetness, such as people use in boarding houses to servants. Well we had no time to fight; since they took 2 hours to come; & had to catch a train. She salaamed to me. She said that the fruit of her Indian stay might be another book. She said â€œMy book had a very long review in the Times.â€ â€œOh? I said. I never knew youâ€™d written a book.â€ â€œIt was a very stupid reviewâ€ she began with furious egotism, gnashing her teeth; & began eagerly to quote. So our minutes passed.

But I ought to run over the 5 weeks or so left out; & really cannot; for I have seen so many people of sorts; & so much has happened; though we are where we are. A printing machine is waiting at Richmond Station, & will be delivered at 8 a.m. tomorrow. Ralph is putting his back to the wheel, a very solid obdurate back. Some of our luncheons have been stormy, or rather silent, with sudden raps of opposition from the third party. My belief is that he has to dig his feet in vigorously in order to make any impression against L.â€™s superior mobility. But we have got along so far; & yielded, not reluctantly, about Tchekhovâ€™s letters. In two days timeâ€”during the week end at any rateâ€”I hope to finish Jacob. I have asked for books from the Times to compell myself to break off. And one of these days I must read it. We go to Rodmell on Friday. I see I can think of nothing worth saying. It has been a November day: soft, dark, as wet as the tropics, with a great funeral (Dr Gardinerâ€™s) passing the windowâ€”

Clive hopes to see more of me. He sups with Gandarilla; & Betsy Bibesco wishes me to review her book.
