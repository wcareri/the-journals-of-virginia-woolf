### Sunday 6 March

But perhaps I colour my view of Morgan from my painterâ€™s box. At any rate, Bob at the Cock the other night made it all seem very reasonable & desirableâ€”â€œa trip to India just the thing for himâ€”a relief after his â€¦ well, his mother is trying sometimesâ€”very fond of him, of course; devoted to him & heâ€¦â€ This in the usual Bob style, hinting little defects & mysteries with one corner of his mouth, praising with the other.

We had a Cock on Fridayâ€”perhaps not quite so good, though vociferous & noisy. Marjorie dines out seldom, I fancy, likes society, throws herself into it, & dresses in salmon pink, short skirt & white stockings: like all Stracheys undoes her premediâ tated care by unpremeditated outburstsâ€”hugs her legs till you seeâ€”well, all there is. Then I was locked with Bob; had my brain wrung dry by his horny conscientious hands. He starts so well; means so well; is a man of such seriousness & integrityâ€”touched with white on the temples to lend him dignity tooâ€”so that to begin with I both like & admire. Oh yes: I end with that too; & yet the steam roller has gone over meâ€”he takes criticism say, or the verse drama, & by the time its over, everything is tight tied in knots; nothing illuminated. He has a shrewd way with him; but why he ever applied himself to an art which wants invention, richness, abandon, originality I really cant say. Poor Bobo was a little stupid as she expressed it: dumb, I should have said; brooding ineffectively over the sorrows of the world. Poor Betty â€¦ poor someone else, left with a bastard. Then she canâ€™t, as she says â€˜find my formâ€™, whether its to be realism, romance, comedy, tragedy. I was more interested in poor Betty, who has come a cropper, which as I explained, is what one likes people to do. She lost Â£200 on her play the other day (Wilde, Bottomley & Fielding: unrecorded) got no notices, no praise, can get no work, has spent all her money; is financed by the Mayors, but they cant make a great actress of her, provide her with a chin, or curtail her nose. She flames with the most melodramatic ambition. Nothing short of a great part, a great audience, a great success will satisfy her. She refuses to accept whatever it is she might have, leaves dreadful notes on the hall table for Boboâ€”who in her turn writes plays, canâ€™t find her form, & is rejected by stage managers. One sees indeed, without much difficulty why the type is an unmarketable one. All is too soft & emotional. Now for writing or anything I believe you must be able to screw up into a ball & pelt straight in peopleâ€™s faces. They vagulate & dissipate.

We parted on an island in Kingsway: she saying to me, looking out from her great dark eyes under her wide hat, hair looping down, a little wild, yet infinitely softâ€”even woolly, â€œI see this evening that I must give up writingâ€ or words to that effect. What she meant, I dont know. Was it a compliment to me? as I should like to think. How pleasant to have ruined someoneâ€™s life all in one evening! But she is one of those who only drift a little way in desperation: she is anchored in niceness & general muddle. So I daresay, is Betty, to whom Iâ€™ve just written.

Nessa approves of Monday or Tuesdayâ€”mercifully; & thus somewhat redeems it in my eyes. But I now wonder a little what the reviewers will make of itâ€”this time next month. Let me try to prophecy. Well, the Times will be kindly, a little cautious. Mrs Woolf, they will say, must beware of virtuosity. She must beware of obscurity â€¦ her great natural gifts &câ€¦. She is at her best in the simple lyric, as in Kew Gardens. An Unwritten Novel is hardly a success. And as for A Society, though spirited, it is too one-sided. Still Mrs Woolf can always be read with pleasure. Then, in the Westminster, Pall Mall, other serious evening papers I shall be treated very shortly, with sarcasm. The general line will be that I am becoming too much in love with the sound of my own voice: not much in what I write: indecently affected; a disagreeable woman. The truth is, I expect, that I shanâ€™t get very much attention anywhere. Yet, I become rather well known. Now L. may have considerable success.
