### Wednesday 16 February

Russian is snatching all the time spared for this book. I can only keep up with L. by running as hard as I can. Everyone prophecies an early end. But I feel myself attached to an express train. With Kot & Leonard dragging me, I must be pulled through somehow. Six months continued at this rateâ€”Russian from 12.15 to 12.45 & from 5.30 to 6. from 9.30 to 10, & on the way to Waterloo & back again must have some result. So far the chief one is as I say that I donâ€™t write here. Let me think how many occasions I have let slip. We have dined twice at the Cock, repairing afterwards to Husseyâ€™sâ€”no Hussey has married the dullest man in Englandâ€”to Niemeyerâ€™s room; the gas fire is broken.

We balance on hard chairs. But the atmosphere is easy & pleasant; the dinner modest, solid, & somehow in keeping with our clothes. More & more do I become in a state of undress. I believe this affects my writingâ€”or its the other way about. Pale, marmoreal Eliot was there last week, like a chapped office boy on a high stool, with a cold in his head, until he warms a little, which he did. We walked back along the Strand. â€œThe critics say I am learned & coldâ€ he said. â€œThe truth is I am neither.â€ As he said this, I think coldness at least must be a sore point with him.

Then there was Murryâ€™s farewell dinner at 46. Clive gritty & bawling, Lytton observant & mute. The rest much as usual. I sat next Murry, & let my prejudices run away with me for the first half. He posed, I thought; looked anguished & martyred. Yet the dinner was at his request. I kept thinking how he summed up us & held us worthless. Then, at the end, I asked after Katherine. Poor man! he poured himself out. We sat on after the others had gone.

â€œBut I lacked imagination, he said. I never saw. I ought to have understood. Iâ€™ve always held one was free to do as one likes. But she was ill, & that made all the difference. And it was nothingâ€”nothing at all.â€

This referred of course, without names, to the Bibesco Scandal, with which London, so they say, rings.

â€œAnd I adore Katherineâ€”Sheâ€™s absolutely the most fascinating person in the worldâ€”Iâ€™m wholly in love with her.â€

Apparently she is worseâ€”dying? God knows. This affair seems to have brought on a crisis. She is desperately depressed, thinks her book bad, canâ€™t write; accuses herself; I imagine, is beside herself with jealousy. Murry asked me to write to her. She feels herself out of things, left alone, forgotten. As he spoke with great feeling, & seemed to be very miserable, & anxious to apologise (was it for this that he wished to see us allâ€”to prove that there was nothing in it?) I liked him, felt with him, & I think there can be no doubt that his love for Katherine anyhow is sincere. All the rest seems of no great importance beside it. Sydneyâ€™s version is of course absurdly over emphatic. We went upstairs & told stories about Ottoline. Desmond was the chief performer. He gets his edges too blurred for my taste. Humanity can be due to laziness, as well as kindness. He refuses to thinkâ€”seems to trust to natural niceness to float him through personal affairsâ€”or so I feel; & thus gets nothing very sharp or thrilling. At anyrate, when Lytton & Roger came to facts they painted a far more splendid vivid figure, Owing to Leonard, it may be, or to natural good taste, I find 46 a little blaring & brazen always, & didnâ€™t much mind catching the last train home. Lytton slipped out with us & whispered his horror & repulsion in the hall. Never would he dine there again. Clive too appalling. L. agreed. So did I. For the truth is no one can speak in their natural voice. Clive was telephoning to Gavrillana (or how does she call herself)? for twenty minutes. An envelope addressed to her lay in the hall. He plumes himself on the affair, which might be conducted on the moon for all I believe in it. I imagine her as stupid as a pearl tie pin.

I skip lots of people, lots of doings. We now think of Cornwall at Easter, with Lyttonâ€™s troupe. My book is an eyesore, & I wake in the night twitching with horror at the thought of it. Now to Dorothy Wordsworthâ€”a quiet evening for once. We have taken to dining out, for some reason.
