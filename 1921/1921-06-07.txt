### Tuesday 7 June

About an hour after writing this in came Eliot, & the first or third thing Eliot said was â€œMurry has been having tea with meâ€”in fact he stayed a very long time, rolling another cigarette, & trying to say something, but he did not say it.â€ So then L. burst out, & told him about the Tchekhov article; & this was no news to Eliot, who said â€œWhen we first knew each other we seemed to be becoming very friendly; but then we realised that we were fundamentally antagonisticâ€”We had nothing to say today. There seemed to be nothing to be said.â€

â€œWhat did you say?â€ I asked.  
â€œHe talked mostly about himself. He said the Athenaeum had almost done for him. He got nothing from going into society except exhaustionâ€”â€œI shanâ€™t do anything till Iâ€™m 50 or 60â€ he saidâ€. Eliot rolled his head & his eyes in imitation of Murry at this. â€œHe canâ€™t hold his own with other people. Thats why he doesnâ€™t like going out.â€ I repeated my phrase â€œHeâ€™s parched with vanity;â€ â€œHe will be very successfulâ€ said Eliot. â€œHeâ€™s been giving 6 lectures on style at Oxfordâ€”as though it were a duty. He takes the crown as soon as heâ€™s offered it. But heâ€™s not satisfied with that.â€  
â€œNo, he wants us & you & Lytton to praise his poetry;â€  
â€œIâ€™ve talked to him about his writing: Iâ€™ve never been able to praise it.â€  
Literature is the devil, I said (meaning for the character).  
He agreed.  
Leonard said how heâ€™d never met a worse man than Murry. That was the gist of what Eliot said; I think indeed his opinion is black at all points; & he knows him, & his methods better than we do. Strange to know a bad man!  
The thing is that he is always trying to bias himself against his badnessâ€”hence his confessions, his poses, & also, so Eliot said, these hysterical admirations for great men who have what he lacks.  
â€œBut never for his contemporariesâ€”â€ I said.  
â€œHe used to lament the decay of D.Â H. Lawrenceâ€ Eliot said.  
â€œHe is a damned swineâ€â€”said L. & L. has written in this sense on a postcard to Sydney inviting him to play chess & discuss Murry.  
Eliot, by the way, saw no truth in Murryâ€™s article.  
â€œHe is extremely cleverâ€ he said.  
â€œBut you donâ€™t mean that in a good senseâ€, I said.  
â€œOh no: not at all.â€  
Now I think its true that Eliot had wished us to open our eyes about Murry. He certainly agreed to all criticisms, & made me feel that he could stress them & add facts if he chose. I think it probable that one of Murryâ€™s devices was to crab us both to Eliot, in his oblique way; & to insinuate that my writing was trivial, & so on.  
â€œNo one has any scopeâ€â€”that was one of his phrases.

It will be interesting to watch his career to the high seat of authority. Unless, as L. says, he commits a felony. Probably in one word Eliot thinks him dishonest through & through.

And Eliot astounded me by praising Monday & Tuesday! This really delighted me. He picked out the String Quartet, especially the end of it. â€œVery goodâ€ he said, & meant it, I think. The Unwritten Novel he thought not successful: Haunted House â€œextremely interestingâ€. It pleases me to think I could discuss my writing openly with him. And I was stoical; & I write without cringing (allow me these words of commendation!) Ulysses he says is prodigious.
