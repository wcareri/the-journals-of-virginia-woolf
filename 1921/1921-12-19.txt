### Monday 19 December

I will add a postscript, as I wait for my parcels to be wrapped up, on the nature of reviewing.  
â€œMrs Woolf? I want to ask you one or two questions about your Henry James articleâ€”â€  
First (only about the right name of one of the stories.) And now you use the word â€˜lewdâ€™. Of course, I dont wish you to change it, but surely that is rather a strong expression to apply to anything by Henry James. I havenâ€™t read the story lately of courseâ€”but still my impression isâ€”  
Well, I thought that when I read it: one has to go by oneâ€™s impressions at the time.  
But you know the usual meaning of the word? It isâ€”ahâ€”dirtyâ€”Now poor dear old Henry Jamesâ€”At anyrate, think it over, & ring me up in 20 minutes.  
So I thought it over & came to the required conclusion in twelve minutes & a half.

But what is one to do about it? He made it sufficiently clear not only that he wouldnâ€™t stand â€˜lewdâ€™, but that he didnâ€™t much like anything else. I feel that this becomes more often the case, & I wonder whether to break off, with an explanation, or to pander, or to go on writing against the current. This last is probably right, but somehow the consciousness of doing that cramps one. One writes stiffly, without spontaneity. Anyhow, for the present I shall let it be, & meet my castigation with resignation. People will complain Iâ€™m sure; & poor Bruce fondling his paper like an only child dreads public criticism, & is stern with me, not so much for disrespect to poor old Henry, but for bringing blame on the Supplement.

And how much time I have wasted!

We dined with Adrian & there was Hope; & we sat in the high draughty cold room with all the empty spaces, shouting at each otherâ€”till I felt the light in my eyes, in my brainâ€”all of me exposed & desolate. These deaf women make society impossible. It is like shouting in a high wind on the Brighton parade.

We had been buying presents, & sitting in the Club wedged between Kot & Bob. Kot persisting, enforcing, emphasising, analysing, rubbing inâ€”how we are to publish Russian booksâ€”how L. is to give up the Contemporaryâ€”no, you misunderstand meâ€”I did not say I consider your life to be worthlessâ€”Bob on the other side unusually calm & even sensitive. He is having his arteries manipulated in order to finish his play. He groaned sadly that he could not write. Desmond tells him that he is not dramatic. What with the Duchess & Desmond he has come to a full stop: & said that he felt an old fogey, & he said this simply & I felt sorry for him; still, he seems to believe in his arteries, & once they start flowing, he will take us all by surpriseâ€”Nor do I, at least, insist upon more plays.

To add to Leonardâ€™s trophies, the Webbs have asked him to edit a book; the League of Nations Union offer to reprint Inl. Government; & the Village in the Jungle is sold among other rare first editions at 6/-. All very good.
