### Monday 8 August

What a gap! How it would have astounded me to be told when I wrote the last word here, on June 7th, that within a week I should be in bed, & not entirely out of it till the 6th of Augustâ€”two whole months rubbed outâ€”These, this morning, the first words I have writtenâ€”to call writingâ€”for 60 days; & those days spent in wearisome headache, jumping pulse, aching back, frets, fidgets, lying awake, sleeping draughts, sedatives, digitalis, going for a little walk, & plunging back into bed againâ€”all the horrors of the dark cupboard of illness once more displayed for my diversion. Let me make a vow that this shall never, never, happen again; & then confess that there are some compensations. To be tired & authorised to lie in bed is pleasant; then, scribbling 365 days of the year as I do, merely to receive without agitation of my right hand in giving out is salutary. I feel that I can take stock of things in a leisurely way. Then the dark underworld has its fascinations as well as its terrors; & then sometimes I compare the fundamental security of my life in all (here Mrs Dedman interrupts for 15 minutes) storms (perhaps I meant) with its old fearfully random conditionâ€”

Later, I had my visitors, one every day; so that I saw more people than normally even. Perhaps in future I shall adopt this method more than I have done. Roger, Lytton, Nessa, Duncan, Dorothy Bussy, Pippa, Carrington, James & Alixâ€”all these came; & were as detached portraitsâ€”cut out, emphatic, seen thus separately compared with the usual way of seeing them in crowds. Lytton, I note, is more than ever affectionate. One must be, I think, if one is famous. One must say to oneâ€™s old friends â€œAll my celebrity is nothingâ€”nothingâ€”compared with thisâ€ And that was what he did say too. We were talking about love. He said he had suffered tortures from Dâ uncan, & Hâ enry Lâ amb had wished to marry them & settle down, had been refused; & now can love no more. â€œIt is madnessâ€”â€ he said. â€œOne cannot treat lovers like rational peopleâ€ this was said of Ralphâ€™s vagaries. â€œThat wonâ€™t happen to us againâ€ â€œYet it is love that still mattersâ€”for look at you, youâ€™ve got fame enoughâ€”I sometimes see my name in the papersâ€”yet that is nothing.â€ â€œYou mean thisâ€”he saidâ€”indicating the 3 of us sitting in the windowâ€”Oh yes, this is what mattersâ€”oneâ€™s friends.â€
