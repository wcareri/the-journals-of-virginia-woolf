### Friday 15 April

I have been lying recumbent all day reading Carlyle, & now Macaulay, first to see if Carlyle wrote better than Lytton, then to see if Macaulay sells better. Carlyle (reminiscences) is more colloquial & scrappy than I remembered, but he has his merits.â€”more punch in his phrase than in Lyttonâ€™s. I donâ€™t count this as my judgment though, since I was half asleep, & havenâ€™t done more than half Vic yet. Lytton rang up this morning to ask for Roger, & I asked him about his book. â€œAre you smothered in laurelsâ€ â€œWell, rather depressed,â€ he said, & so he sounded. â€œIâ€™m in the middle; & then I shall write to you about itâ€ â€œAnd Iâ€™m writing to you about yoursâ€ he answered. â€œWe will be candidâ€ I said. â€œWhen shall I see you? Never, presumably.â€ Anyday next week would do, he said,â€”he is coming to tea & dinner on Wednesday. So fame hasnâ€™t done him much harm. Heâ€™s sold, so they say, 5,000 copies this week, & another edition is printing. I have sold just 300. Well, but that doesnâ€™t prove my immortality, as I insinuate. The truth is I have no notion of my standing, or of Lyttonâ€™s. One ought to write more of this occasion, since I suppose in 20 yearsâ€™ time the publication of Queen Victoria will be thought an important matter; but these things arenâ€™t important to us. They say heâ€™s been given a bust of Prince Albert & a photograph of the Queen by a spectacle maker. And Max Beerbohm is doing a caricature of him, & altogether heâ€™s a solid celebrity, one of our leading writers, not merely the hero of one book which might not be repeated. Ralph seems willing to go on with our printing, though orders have again sunk low. No review of Tchekhov or L. yet; only shorter mention by donkey Dalton I suppose in the Lit. Sup. This is the first free time for reading Iâ€™ve had for an age,â€”I shall lavish it all on Q.V. & must now go & fetch her, since of course Roger borrows her to read oâ€™nights.

A queer sort of stillness seems already settling down on us, as of Sunday. This is the foreboding of the General Strike. We have put off going to Rodmell. Marjorieâ€™s party is put off. L. has just come in with a paper which says that nothing has been done to patch up the strike. Therefore at 10 tonight, unless something happens meanwhile, all trains, trams, buses, mines, & perhaps electric light works come to an end. The servants have been to the Coops & brought back a weeks groceries. We have a bundle of candles. Our most serious lack is coal, as Nelly forgot to order any. We burn coke in the drawing room & cook on gas. Still, Heaven knows why, I donâ€™t believe the strike will happen.
