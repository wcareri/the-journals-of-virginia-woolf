### Saturday 26 November

Kot just gone after hearing Leonard his Russian; & so I have an odd half hour to fill up, & reach for this book. I have been cross examining Kot upon the quarrel between Dostoevsky & Turgenev, & find him stuffed with facts, & of course passionate severe & uncompromising. For once in a way I shall have some truth to put in my article. We have spent the day mostly indoors, labelling Roger this afternoon. A yellow, prickly kind of day, with the quiet which comes of fog, & is accentuated, as it happens, by the road being up. It is said that we are to have wood pavement. Today we raised the servants wages by Â£2 each; & Nelly, for a joke pretended that we had raised her & not Lottie, & I believe this has taken away Lottieâ€™s pleasure. I believe she suspects that we perhaps meant this, or preferred Nelly. At any rate, we have had no thanks.

As for Mary I am playing a fine diplomatic game. I have no timeâ€”7.30 draws nearâ€”to detail the stages. But I aim at not seeing her; at being friendly; for ever planning to meet; & never never never coming to grips. As if to emphasise this, my nib here dropped into the pot & is clogged with black ink. I canâ€™t help suspecting that this is her game too. What could we say to each other alone?
