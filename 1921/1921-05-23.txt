So Carrington did make up her mind to become Partridgeâ€”no, that is precisely what she is determined not to do; & signs herself aggressively Carrington for ever. If people ever took advice I should feel a little responsible for making up Ralphâ€™s mind. I mean I am not sure that this marriage is not more risky than most. Certainly she is not in love; & he has the obdurate Anglo Indian in him. But still, if she couldnâ€™t face the prospect of a week end breach, or of a journey alone to Italy, she had no alternative. So they were married on Saturday. The day before Michael Davies was drowned bathing at Oxford. Life does this sort of thing too habituallyâ€”I begin to feel bored, like a passenger thrown from side to side of a ship. I dont describe what I feel: something of anger at the unreason of it; & something ofâ€”not indifference, no: but as if one knew by this time how things go: first these marriages, at the same moment deaths. Just from not knowing how to swim he pulled another young man down, & now at the age of 21 itâ€™s all over for both of them. And then in this fine weather too. We have been to Rodmell, & as usual I come home depressedâ€”for no reason. Merely moods. Have other people as many as I have? That I shall never know. And sometimes I suppose that even if I came to the end of my incessant search into what people are & feel I should know nothing still. I mean I go on thinking in the belief that if one thinks about it enough one comes to some conclusion. That I begin to judge doubtful. I was thinking about this in the Strand todayâ€”wondering whether I am after some play or novel, as I go on ferreting away. But Iâ€™m too scatterbrained to get it right. I was up in the Strand with 12 copies of Monday or Tuesday; so that sells a little; & 2 goslings, to be sent to Lewes; & my review of Patmore for the Times; & then caught a train home, put my great lupins & peonies in water, & should now settle with concentration to my book. But which book? Iâ€™ve a notion of reading masterpieces only; for Iâ€™ve read literature in bulk so long. Now I thinkâ€™s the time to read like an expert. Then Iâ€™m wondering how to shape my Reading book; the more I read of other peoples criticism the more I trifle; canâ€™t decide; nor need I just yet. But how I enjoy the exercise of my wits upon literatureâ€”reading it as literature. And I think I can do this the better for having read through such a lot of lives, criticisms, every sort of thing.

We had dinner to report Desmondâ€™s talk the other night. He talked admirably for the purpose, but less intimately which was natural; & yet I hate people to talk admirably, as if they were dining out. There was Roger, & Molly & good Miss Green. Thatâ€™s my dâ€”â€”d condescensionâ€”I cant help condescending to very plain poor serviceable women, & then they bob up as happy as grigs & twice as able as I am.
