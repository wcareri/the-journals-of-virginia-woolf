### Friday 18 February

I have been long meaning to write a historical disquisition on the return of peace; for old Virginia will be ashamed to think what a chatterbox she was, always talking about people, never about politics. Moreover, she will say, the times you lived through were so extraordinary. They must have appeared so, even to quiet women living in the suburbs. But indeed nothing happens at one moment rather than another. The history books will make it much more definite than it is. The most significant sign of peace this year is the sales; just over; the shops have been flooded with cheap clothes. A coat & skirt that cost Â£14 in November went for 7 perhaps 5. People had ceased to buy, & the shops had to dispose of things somehow. Margery Strachey who has been teaching at Debenhams foretells bankruptcy for most of the shopkeepers this very month. Still they go on selling cheaply. Pre-war prices, so they say. And I have found a street market in Soho where I buy stockings at 1/ a pair: silk ones (flawed slightly) at 1/10. A hundred yards down the road they ask 5/6 to 10/6 for the same things, or so they seem. Food has fallen a penny here, a penny there, but our books scarcely show a change. Milk is high, 11d a quart. Butter fallen to 3/- but this is Danish butter. Eggsâ€”I dont know what eggs are. Servant girls aged 20 get Â£45 wages. And the Times pays me 3 guineas instead of Â£2.2 for a column. But I think youâ€™ll find all this written more accurately in other books, my dear Virginia: for instance in Mrs Gosseâ€™s diary & Mrs Webbâ€™s. I think it true to say that during the past 2 months we have perceptibly moved towards cheapnessâ€”just perceptibly. It is just perceptible too that there are very few wounded soldiers abroad in blue, though stiff legs, single legs, sticks shod with rubber, & empty sleeves are common enough. Also at Waterloo I sometimes see dreadful looking spiders propelling themselves along the platformâ€”men all bodyâ€”legs trimmed off close to the body. There are few soldiers about.

To change the subject, Rose Macaulay dined here last weekâ€”something like a lean sheep dog in appearanceâ€”harum scarumâ€”humbleâ€”too much of a professional, yet just on the intellectual side of the border. Might be religious though: mystical perhaps. Not at all dominating or impressive: I daresay she observes more than one thinks for. Clear pale mystical eyes. A kind of faded moon of beauty: oh & badly dressed. I donâ€™t suppose we shall ever meet for she lives with Royd Smith, & somehow wonâ€™t come to grips with us.
