### Friday 18 March

Just back from two days at Manchester. I fancied myself writing this account, & how good it would be; what lots of things I had to say; & now the pen brings blankness. Well I was kept awake by business men talking in low steady almost continuous voices in the room above till 1.30: & we were up early, breakfasted & caught a train, & so home, travelling all through the great rocky moors of Derbyshireâ€”bald moors; the strangest looking places. So solitary they might be 18th Century England, the valleys cut by a thread of water falling roughly from heights; great sweeps of country all sunny & gloomy with bare rocks against the sky, & then behold a row of east end slum houses, with a strip of pavement & two factory chimneys set down in the midst. The houses are all stone, bleak, soot stained, different from our cottages; not cottages at all, but streets. Suddenly, in the palm of a wide valley you come on a complete townâ€”gasworks, factories, & little streams made to run over stone steps & turn engines I suppose. Now & again no houses but wild moors, a thread of road, & farms set into the earth, uncompromising, since nothing like flowers, long grass, or hedges grow round them.

â€œYes, I said to Mrs Unwin, Derbyshire is a very fine country.â€ We were standing in a pit at the University, a table beneath a light below us, & a row of chairs, on which sat Professors Unwin, Findlay, Goldman (a financier) & Weiss. Leonard then got up & made his speech, a very vigorous one. We sat round on hard benches, with ink pots, or the holes for them, in front of us.

All Manchester streets are the same, & all strung with tramlines. These follow each other at a few yards distance, making the roads mechanical & unsociable. You hear bells striking all the time. Then there are no tea shops, but great cafÃ©s; & no little shops, but all big drapers. We lodged (paying 18/ each for bed only) at the Queens Hotel, in a large square; but whats a square when the trams meet there? Then thereâ€™s Queen Victoria, like a large tea cosy, & Wellington, sleek as a mastiff with paw extended; none of this was quite English, or at least London. The people were lower middle class, no sprinkling of upper class.

But my observation of the university type was more profound. Mr & Mrs Weiss gave a dinner in the refectory before L.â€™s second speech; & there they all wereâ€”professors & wives, elderly people, depressed looking, like the inferior branch of a profession, with the manner of dons, but not the extreme confident eccentricity of first rate brains. But how supercilious I thought myself, & ultimately how much pure merit seemed in them, with the very thinnest coating of decorum. The women were dowdy; oh yes, but they too had fought for the rightâ€”which is a phrase I distrust, but how use any other of people, struggling along just decently on so many pounds a year, & sacrificing it, as a matter of course, for their views. P. Unwin told me he had been arrested 3 times for attending seditious meetings during the war. Mrs Weiss said her husband had resigned because the University refused to accept a C.O. upon which they thought better of it. And yet there is no surface brilliancy; not a scrap of romance. It is a little familiar professional society, trying to keep up the standards, which (perhaps wrongly) I suppose must be hard work in Manchester, or am I merely snobbish in thinking it harder to say clever things & write clever books in Manchester than in Cambridge? I applied the test of fatherâ€™s name twice; but neither Unwin or Weiss had heard it. The women had their activities not so pronounced as in Cambridge, pleasanter perhaps; common efforts to get up bazaars; enquiries about health; shabby best clothes. Old Mrs (Findlay) Herford (I distributed the husbands & wives all wrongly) & Professor Finlay sat patiently looking at the tablecloth with nothing to say, like two old horses who have been working in the fields all day together.

L., in the large room after dinner, was emphatically first rate; I donâ€™t mean his clothes; nor yet his speech; but its a question of being the master. Now all the professors know that theyâ€™re not masters. I think L.â€™s remark that he did not wish to be elected rather flabbergasted them; & I fancy they asked themselves afterwards why the Woolves had taken the trouble to comeâ€”â€œAre you a politician?â€ they asked me. â€œDo you do much organising work?â€ I said I listened. Mrs Findlay shook her head. Why was I there then? Oh for the fun of spending Â£10 in Manchester & seeing the Zoo. Lord! what a scatterbrain I am! But theyâ€™d none of them read my books. So we went to the Zoo; & I daresay I could write something interesting about thatâ€”a pale stone desert given over to charwomen & decorators: a few bears, a mandrill, & a fox or twoâ€”all in the desolation of depression.
