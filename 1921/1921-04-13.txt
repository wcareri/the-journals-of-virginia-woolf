### Wednesday 13 April

Now I note the latest symptomâ€”complete absence of jealousy. What I mean is that I shall feel instantly warm & pleased (not only after an hour & a sharp pang) if thereâ€™s a long & sound & appreciative review of L. in the Lit Sup tomorrow. I think this is perfectly true. Most people, though, would not have to write this down. I suppose I had a qualm or two. No time for more than this interesting & important statement. Rather to our respite, Roger is away for the night after a fair bust up yesterdayâ€”Ray Pippa Saxon all togetherâ€”& I must read my book. A strike now proclaimed for Friday, & we had just planned to go to Monks.
