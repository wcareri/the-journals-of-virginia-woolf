I am not satisfied that this book is in a healthy way. Suppose one of my myriad changes of style is antipathetic to the material?â€”or does my style remain fixed? To my mind it changes always. But no one notices. Nor can I give it a name myself. The truth is that I have an internal, automatic scale of values; which decides what I had better do with my time. It dictates â€˜This half hour must be spent on Russianâ€™ â€˜This must be given to Wordsworth.â€™ or â€˜now Iâ€™d better darn my brown stockings.â€™ How I come by this code of values I dont know. Perhaps its the legacy of puritan grandfathers. I suspect pleasure slightly. God knows. And the truth is also that writing, even here, needs screwing of the brainâ€”not so much as Russian, but then half the time I learn Russian I look in the fire & think what I shall write tomorrow. Mrs Flanders is in the orchard. If I were at Rodmell I should have thought it all out walking on the flats. I should be in fine writing trim. As it is Ralph Carrington & Brett have this moment gone; Iâ€™m dissipated; we dine & go out to the Guild. I cant settle as I should to think of Mrs Flanders in the orchard. Brett is gay, pink, brown, vivacious. Why did I think her a moping figure in the chimney corner? Ottâ€™s insinuations, I suppose. She told me that she has an inner view of Ottoline unguessed by the rest of us. Deafness, she says, makes one a judge of truth. You become an expert in faces.

We came back from Rodmell yesterday; & Rodmell was all gold & sunshine. The one dismal element was provided by the human race. We went to tea at the Rectory, & found, alas, a roomful of dressed women, including Mrs Allinson, & Mr Fisher, & Mr & Mrs Shanks. This surly poet, so we judged him (and his poetry is Squireâ€™s poetry) proposes to live in the village. We shall meet him. He will look in. Oh dearâ€”no more dreaming & rambling for meâ€”always the risk of a recall to editions & royalties, & what Sylvia Lynd thinks of Tomlinson. Our garden becomes a suburban garden. Anything would be better than a poetâ€”than one of Squireâ€™s poets. I would rather have Gerald Duckworth himselfâ€”& he is to be married tomorrow.

It is settled that we go to Zennor with the Lytton company on the 23rd. Before that we go to Manchester. So the summer is on us. Already I feel time broken up. I must buy some clothes. & I note with pride that I have just received Â£45 from America for the Vâ oyage Oâ ut. Then Violet Dickinson came to tea hereâ€”grown half a foot taller, but otherwise unchanged; wrists a little coarse & even dirty; pearls & emeralds round her neck; asking questions, never listening, rapid, intuitive, humorous in her slap dash way, careering about to tea parties marriages & sick beds & keeping up her connection with lunatics & institutions, like a woman of the 90ties. One of the lay sisters who go about doing good, & talking gossip, almost improved out of existence nowadays I suppose; a survival from the 19th Century are of individual goodness.

My book is back from the printer, who has added the final eyesoreâ€”a brown back. There it is in masses, & I canâ€™t read it, for fear of howlers, printers as well as writers. L.â€™s stories are today, bating a line or two, done. Now Clive proposes we should bring out his private poems. Morgan goes to India, & I think for ever. He will become a mystic, sit by the roadside, & forget Europe, which I think he half despises. In thirty years time he may turn up again, give us an amused look, & return to the East, having written a little unintelligible poetry. He has no roots here. And the news made me melancholy. I like him, & like having him about. But we shanâ€™t see him again. He sails on Friday.
