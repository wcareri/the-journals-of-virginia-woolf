### Thursday 2 June

But this was written a week ago, today being the day after Derby Day, the very height of the season, I suppose: anyhow of leaf & flower.

People turn up regularly though with little planning on our part. Madge Vaughan on Friday; Kot on Saturday; Roger; Fredegond; Mr Reginald Morris. Will these names recover anything in 10 years time of the last week of May 1921? I wish I had the same record of 10 years back, when I was a young womanâ€”only then one canâ€™t scribble. One takes thought. One gets it too literal. Madge asked to come; so we had her. She is curiously changed. She has become ordinary.

Middle age has thickened her lines, & deepened her colour. In her mind she is grown cheerful, & commonplace. I notice now that her forehead is oddly pinched at the top. She said of herself that she was stuntedâ€”which expresses it. She has never grown up, but lived somewhere under shelter, unchastised, talking a great deal about life, but not facing it. Oh she did talk about lifeâ€”always with reference to herself, which makes the mind squint. She sees nothing in itself. So we vacillated between â€˜lifeâ€™ & Will: â€˜my lifeâ€™: â€˜my odd natureâ€™, â€˜I have no brainâ€™ â€˜I am very psychologicalâ€™. But then I ought to have broken away, & so on; but as it is quite obvious that she is rich, successful, & happy, these complaints which make the staple of her talk, lack substance; & she easily slides into gossip, & repetition. Indeed you canâ€™t keep her to poetry, kitchen, love, art, or children for more than a minute. Yet she has her gaiety & her vitality which protect one from the worst boredom. But not Leonard nor Roger. They were out of hand with misery. And this was the woman I adored! I see myself now standing in the night nursery at Hyde Park Gate, washing my hands, & saying to myself â€œAt this moment she is actually under this roof.â€

Fredegond came, all in black (& she dresses very badly). Uncle Hervey is dead, she said. And she was off to bury him, but couldnâ€™t find a train (the strike, you see, is still on.) Hervey Fisher was the genius of our youth; & the only fruit of it is a volume of stories which are neither better nor worse than what one reads on a journey in a Red Magazine. They said he was dropped by his nurse; & so for 52 years, poor man, he has been plagued with illness; has been mad; has never done anything he liked, I suppose, even his marriage being called off by Aunt Mary.
