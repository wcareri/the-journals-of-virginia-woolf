### Sunday 10 April

I must note the symptoms of the disease, so as to know it next time. The first day oneâ€™s miserable: the second happy. There was an Affable Hawk on me in the New Statesman which at anyrate made me feel important (& its that that one wants) & Simpkin & Marshall rang up for a second fifty copies. So they must be selling. Now I have to stand all the twitching & teasing of private criticism which I shant enjoy. Thereâ€™ll be Roger tomorrow. What a bore it all is!â€”& then one begins to wish one had put in other storiesâ€”or left out the Haunted House, which may be sentimental. Anyhow next week thereâ€™ll be Tchekhov & Leonard as well as me. And suppose every one (that is to say the 6 people who matter) praise Leonard, shall I be jealousâ€”but, mark my word, all of this will be forgotten in 6 weeks time.

Pernel dined here: they dress badly, as I think Iâ€™ve said before. I think perhaps she grows a little pensive; but Iâ€™m not good at judging my friendsâ€™ moods. Then Roger came inâ€”utterly unweariedâ€”in spite of standing on a ladder for 8 hours restoring Mantegnas. He draws people here in shoalsâ€”yesterday, just after Kot had gone, in came Mr & Mrs Reece, & tomorrow thereâ€™ll be Pippaâ€”always some slave or other attending; & as weâ€™re in the middle of the rush we get whelmed, & I canâ€™t write sense or nonsense, & must devote all this week to reviewing.â€”I want to read Victoria & Swift.
