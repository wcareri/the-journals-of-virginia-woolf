### Sunday 3 February

Notes:

Mrs W. saying she had been â€œhappyâ€ suddenly the night before. And once walking up Regent Street. What a divine feeling. And then it went. She did not know what caused it, or how to describe it

(2) The man in charge of the cactuses at Kew. The unreality: himself become a living cactus, perhaps: or a hater of cactuses. Their involved serpentings: their grotesqueness. As a matter of fact he was a withered & bloodless old man. Gone grey, infinitely bored, by living with cactuses.
