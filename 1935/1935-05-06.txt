Zutphen

This is Jubilee day, it strikes me; a very hot fine day. As for Holland: in the first place the cows wear coats; then the cyclists go in flocks like starlings, gathering together, skimming in & out. Driving is dangerous. Towns are large. They are also strung out, mile on mile. We are back in 1913. Everywhere there are shops full of clothes, food, books. The people are dressed in perfect respectability. Sailors wear felt hats. From 10 to 25 the girls are elegant, dove grey, slender, skimming on their cycles in & out. From 30 to 50 they amass vast bodies. But always the bodies are tight, spruce, shoes elegant hair beautifully done (& there Iâ€™ve dropped cigarette ash on the perfectly clean sheets of this modest empty hotel). Every street is 16th or 17th century, with curved apricot coloured awnings. As we say, the houses are the glory of Hollandâ€”the richly carved big windowed houses; some lean a little, others are peaked; but each is a solid spruce perfectly self respecting house, in which last night I saw the Sunday diners, old men old women sitting round with children, cactuses; a cat & a dog. We have 20 people round us wherever we stop. The apziâ€”the kleine apzi! I forget exactly how it all goes. Towns too big of course: Amsterdam a swollen stone monster, shaved off like a ruin on the side of the marsh: our first lunch at the Hague had 20 courses. Very expensive. Meals very early. People immensely respectable. No sign of crisis or war; The man on the ferry, said like all the rest, they wished they had gone off the gold standard. No visitors. Trade with England ended. Oh but the carved doors, the curved white faÃ§ades, the, lilac trees: the air of swept & garnished prosperity, antiquity, air, cleanliness. Here in Zutphenâ€”but weâ€™ve only arrived 2 hours & had our Mitzi levÃ©e, & then came to this modest Inn, with a canal outside; & a broad river beyond.

Ideas that struck me.  
That the more complex a vision the less it lends itself to satire: the more it understands the less it is able to sum up & make linear. For example: Shre & Dostoevsky neither of them satirise. The age of understanding: the age of destroyingâ€”& so on.

Belchamber.  
A moving, in its way, completed story. But shallow. A superficial book. But also a finished one. Rounded off. Only possible if you keep one inch below; because the people, like Sainty, have to do things without diving: deep; & this runs in the current: which lends itself to completeness. That is, if a writer accepts the conventions, & lets his characters be guided by them, not conflict with them, he can produce an effect of symmetry: very pleasant, suggestive; but only on the surface. That is, I cant care what happens: yet I like the design. Also disgust at the cat monkey psychology, to which he is admirably faithful. A sensitive sincere mindâ€”Howdie, doing his embroidery, & making his acute observations. Not a snob either.
