### Wednesday 27 November

Too many specimen daysâ€”so I cant write, yet, Heaven help me, have a feeling that Ive reached the no manâ€™s land that Iâ€™m after; & can pass from outer to inner, & inhabit eternity. A queer very happy free feeling, such as Iâ€™ve not had at the finish of any other book. And this too is a prodigious long one. So what does it mean?

But Oh my specimen days: Sunday Ray for tea; dine at the hotel with Mrs W.: course after course, all bad; to Nessaâ€™s: she & Duncan alone with new cat, Ruff: Monday, to the ~~NatGall~~ Francks; rather lost my head, too tired to think; settle my mind; Miss White, Stephen S. dine: Sally Graves Helen Igor in after; Tuesday; Stephen Tom & Edith Hales (Boston) tea. Black edged card handed me. M & Mme Gillet; all ruined, dryed: 3 hours wasted. L. annoyed, no music, too tired to read, & cant write; & Ethel Sands to tea, & Vita lunches tomorrow. Why cant I get quit of it all? Still happiness persists. And now for 30 mins of Rogerâ€™s letters to Helenâ€”that vast sparkling dust heap, the best so far; but how to dig out? how to represent? I must read & read & wait on the moment of illumination. Cold frosty weather, dry for a miracle, & very sunny.
