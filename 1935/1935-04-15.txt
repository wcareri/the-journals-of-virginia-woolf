Not a very nice last meeting at Nessaâ€™s last night, because L. suddenly turned stony in the way I know: & cut up rusty, when we got back, ostensibly because I suggested staying not 7 days but 10 in Rome. I suppose it was the old family grievance moling again; throwing up sudden hills. But this is all silly rot, I said, as I waited for him to come & he didnâ€™t come; so went in & laughed. The truth is he had spent the whole morning filling up forms for our journeyâ€”which, I say, I could have done; & then I upset his plans in favour of my family, & stayed talking. And he had 2 hours of Willy: & is tired. And come to think of it, weâ€™re both very happy. I shall be glad when we can stretch a little at Monks House, & neednâ€™t meet Bells & so start moling. By way of reward for my sweetness of temperâ€”but what does L. think of my temper? my book went well today; I think it probably rather good.

Yesterday another defence of Bloomsbury by Ellis Roberts in the S. Times: of me in particular (thanks I think to my â€˜charmâ€™ at Ottolineâ€™s;) I am the most original mind that has written novels in the past 20 years, & so on. Nessa is going to Cochran this morning about a new curtain for one of his shows, & Iâ€™m not jealous. But oh how nice to have all this done with for six weeks! Now to write a little Italian from Danaro. I will learn German next year.
