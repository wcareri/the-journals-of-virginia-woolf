We went to Swakeleys Farm yesterday & bought a dogâ€”Sally. She has a fine domed head; is like a three of black diamonds very globular eyes; a bloodhounds muzzle; very affectionate, stipple, 13 months old, clasps L.â€™s breast, climbs on to his chair, & is afraid of the basement stairs. She cost Â£18â€”dear me. Still as we say, its nice to have a good dog. And we shall breed from her. She is very distinguished looking. The only question is, has she intelligence? She has already her own rather gentle whimsical mannerâ€”fumbles, paws; is lighter, more nervous, perhaps less solid a character than Pinka. But so far she has no marked fault, unless she is perhaps fastidious about her food. Had her nose been the 18th of an inch longer, she would have been a champion like her sister, who fetched Â£2, or Â£300.

Mr Lloyd is a great expert. He lives in a trim villa residence, that is, in fact an old farm; has 1701 on the chimney. But the room where we waited was completely modernised: with all the cups & bowls, cigar cases, engraved with tributes, in what are called perhaps chiffoniers. He has made a very snug place for himself out of the passion for cockers. â€œA very nice little personâ€ he said. So did the Kennel man. They have their own language. It was broiling hot, & the garden paved with sham crazy paving: all the image of a garden.
