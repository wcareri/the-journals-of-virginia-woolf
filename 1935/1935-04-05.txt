### Friday 5 April

Angelicaâ€™s last concert yesterday in a snowstorm. And we took the wrong turning & went in the sleet almost to Southend. Snow falling all the time across the dark yew trees. And not a very rich performance. Angelica acting. Judith reciting French with a perfect accent, mothers in the drawing room. A great tea. Mrs Curtis opulent. The usual thingsâ€”& so home in the coldâ€”Duncan asleep.

L. dined at the Cranium & met James who says he means, owing to Swinnerton & other attacks, to set about a very long life of Lytton with all the letters; & he wishes to â€˜lay it downâ€™ that what he wants is that I should write a character of Lytton as introduction. Lytton & Rogerâ€”so my work as a biographer is cut outâ€”I wonder. But Iâ€™m glad, I think, that there should be a full & outspoken life. Only not as a reply to criticism. And then the buggery? But it will take James a long time. The usual heartless, cold day & we go to Rodmell. And Iâ€™m tired of writing; yet must press on & do this difficult chapter; which I shall get done before we goâ€”to Holland we think on May 1stâ€”3 weeks & 4 days. Oh to sit in the sun & let my mind browse!
