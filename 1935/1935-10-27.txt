### Sunday 27 October

Adrianâ€™s birthday, it strikes me. And we asked him to dine. No, I will not hurry this book. Iâ€™m going to let every scene shape fully & easily in my hands, before sending it to be typed, even if it has to wait another year. I wonder why time is always allowed to harry one. I think it rather good this morning. Iâ€™m doing Kittyâ€™s party. And in spite of the terrific curb on my impatienceâ€”never have I held myself back so drasticallyâ€”Iâ€™m enjoying this writing more fully & with less strain &â€”whats the word? I mean its giving me more natural pleasure than the others. But I have such a pressure of other books kicking their heels in the hall its difficult to go on, very slowly.

Yesterday we walked across Ken Wood to Highgate & looked at the 2 little old Fry houses. Thats where Roger was born & saw the poppy. I think of beginning with that scene. Yes, that book shapes itself. Then theres my Next Warâ€”which at any moment becomes absolutely wild, like being harnessed to a shark; & I dash off scene after scene. I think I must do it directly The Years is done. Suppose I finish The Years in Jan: then dash off The War (or whatever I call it) in six weeks: & do Roger next summer.

It is a grey dim windy day: I walked along the Euston Rd. & was beaten by its sheer gloom; came back & did Rogerâ€”Pâ amelaâ€™s letters; & Iâ€™m furious with Ellis Roberts who has told the PEN I wish to be elected.
