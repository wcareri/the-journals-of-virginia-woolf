### Saturday 30 March

Charles Morgans to dinner last night. Nessa, Duncan & Graham in afterwards. Not an alarming pair, the Ms. He rather sunk eyed & official: sheâ€”oh how she interrupted! Vague, vapid, well meaning. Oh but Charles you must tell them the Hancock storyâ€”Charles you mustnâ€™t be modest &c. We were talking about the Navy: Charles wrote a book showing up the bullying of midshipmen. How they were made to do â€œevolutionsâ€ 4 nights out of 7. Evolutions meant jumping over chairs & being beaten. Then they drank with the beaters; were then beaten again. Those who are not virgins must report that they have had such & such women of the town by Saturday. One of them wrote it in his diary, sent it to his parson father, who reported to the Admiralty. They appealed to his patriotism. He threatened to go to Carmelite House: there was an enquiry & his son resigned. Morgan a well meaning cultivated egoist, little sunk eyesâ€™ like Jowitt. Lives on a plan so as to get as much out of himself as possible. Bed at 2, after the play. Breakfast at 9 in bed: writes novels from 4 to 7. So it goes on, & The Fountain is the result. Occasionally a light came in his sunk eyes; about the Dreadnought for example; but he is colourless & pale like one of the D. of Newcastleâ€™s horses. Sheâ€™s flyaway, visualises, sees, where Charles, if theyre walking in a wood, remembersâ€”I walked here once. Charlesâ€™ father built Victoria Station & showed Charles a picture of Chatterton to dissuade him from poetry. Must have a profession & write at leisure. So at 11 he chose the Navy. Then went to Walkley, was made his understudy on the Times: will there remain, hoarding his novel money for his children. Oneâ€™s 8, the other 10. A very well meaning honourable but sunken man. Graham roared with laughter when they left & said Mrs Morgan was the image of John Braddockâ€™s wife. Very red & young: has shaven his beard; talked to Nessa.

Some chestnut trees in the Park just coming out. Small leaves.
