### Saturday 22 June, Rodmell

The Bees are swarming this week end, & Percy goes about in flannel trousers with a net over his head, very self important. â€œIâ€™m going to get a friend to help me tonight, & we shall cut out the Queensâ€ heâ€™s just said.

It has suddenly become full summer: droning, misting, with birds & bees. The cuckoo calling in the elm tree at 3 or 4 this morning so that I had to stop my ears. The heat came suddenly as we walked by the river on Friday. And the field in front is red with something that farmer Bottenâ€™s growing in his bog. Wehad mushroomsâ€”people come out at 4 or 5 to pick them. Instead of surveying all this in a torpid swoon of pleasure, illustrated by scenes from my book, Mrs W. & Harold came to tea; she stumbled on the doorstep & turned her ankle. Then there were figures passing the windowâ€”Jack & Jeremy: whereupon she lost all interest in life, poor old lady, thinking that no one would listen to her family stories. She cannot stretch to take in any stranger. But, after saying that the garden was the best they had ever seen, they went on to the Glyndebourne opera. Monty Shearman was strolling, all in black, outside .. Harold Mrs W. & I continued our rather burbling conversation: about highbrows, & then about Maids, & the hotel. I heard all about L.â€™s father, & how he did not take silk till he was 45, & made his name overâ€”I forget what case; so it comes over & over again, the story of her life, with the usual comments. â€œAnd I ask myself, what for? And I am now so lonely. I have lived alone so many years nowâ€¦â€ which, I mechanically turn off upon Bella: who is now Queen of Hong Kong. She is very ambitious. And so wonderfully tactful. And so popular. What dress did she wear? A beautiful white taffeta. Tom was so generousâ€”He gave her some money to spend on clothes. She has to have so many. In the old days she did not mind how she dressed. So we droned, sitting on the terrace before, this houseâ€”very successful as a sitting place on a hot day.

Why does this talk smear my mind so that I cant settle in at 6.30 to do anything but march up & down the terrace? Poor old lady. She has shrunk slightly, carries some animal with a white belly, & white gloves. Harold brings his horse down on a trailer & rides on the downs. The horse is fed by an automatic feeder invented by himself. He has given up his yatcht, as Alice dislikes it. L. buying newspapers was told by the newsagent the story of Miss Wightman. She wears her fathers mackintosh & nothing underneath. It is getting old, & coming to bits. She is a poet, & has won a medal from the King which she keeps in a red morocco case, & the newsagent has seen it.
