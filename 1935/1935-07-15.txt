### Monday 15 July

I have let the days slip I see, a good thing no doubt, as this book is too full; but I have left out a good many encounters; my visit to the Buchans, a strenuous day, which left me raddled; & we went to Monks House, where, as I have not noted, Stephen Tennant was planted; & came & talked, Happily gone to Piddinghoe, though; & I slept; then there was the heat waveâ€”still indomitably with us; & then Odette & Clive & the Brehansâ€”she a Paris tart, with eyebrows elongated like antennae, to give her the likeness of a bird in flight, she being all for speed & vengeance & venom & viceâ€”not a woman I like; & Clive sparred, nor did she like meeting anyone who knew her ways. Gerald to me grown commonplace & dried, like one of those hams or tongues that hang in country grocers shops: always, too, uneasily reverting to his book, which was only by way of lesson & trial; indeed he spent, some time reading up facts about rogues in the Brit. Mus. But it is fatal to try to excuse oneâ€™s works. His wife is a rather faded but L. says very nice, genuine & simple, American; & they go back to their lovely Malaga house, where Gerald has, as he rather ostentatiously intimated, his illegitimate children. There, in an English Colony, they can live patriarchally on Â£100 a year; & he can for ever turn & fumble over his books; looking, poor man, with those obstinate little eyes, for the right word. But it was a jangled evening, during which, by the way, round the corner at the Bussys, Frances Partridge gave birth to a son; or rather had him cut out: & all went well.

All this time the Bristol speech was weighing on me, and making me unable to get into my swing for the last lap: so I shut down, wrote it, learnt it, said it & went to Bristol, the hottest day of the year on Friday & said it, dripping, to a large, but not I think very appropriate audience. It puzzles me why such displays, using up so much nerve power, should be needed. There was Rogerâ€™s face on the canvas, smiling at me, & them. But oh the heavenly relief when we drove off in the hot evening to Bradford on Avon, & slept the night in an ancient workhouse; in the valley; with a disordered garden, a stream with rotting sacks of old clothes, & the usual elderly ladies, retired business men, spaniels, bustling landladies & so on. And then, with a divine inspiration, we made across Avebury to Lechlade; went to Fairford & found the Carnival braying outside the church with the painted windows, had tea ad. lib: the milk in enamel jugs, the sugar in zinc bath tubs; under the trees; then slept at Lechlade, walked by the river, saw the moon rise, like a rose petal, & yesterday drove to Kelmscot & peeped over the wall. In this country everything is made of silver grey flaky stone, & the houses cluster round, with their little gables, all crowded, ancient, with roses, with haystacks, & the river flowing in the great grass meadows, all untouched, beyond the builders ring, which begins at Abingdon, & then till London all becomes red brick Georgian; & Riverine, that is gramo-phontic, girls in trousers, young men in shorts, all noisy & strident & a little indecentâ€”a bad lunch at the Quarry Hotel & so home here.

Nor must I forget Mr Ellis Roberts, not that he is attractive, an inky little podgy underworld man, who came to ask me to be president of the PEN in succession to Wells. This great honour, unanimously offered with Priestly enthusiastic, would involve meeting authors, for which purpose apparently it existsâ€”that authors should meet & discuss each others works. With E.R. in front of meâ€”but no: how could anyone invent such a post, how could anyone accept it? He pretended, poor worm, to feel as I did; which was a lie.

And now, with a brain washed cool & rid of that intolerable speech, I must dream myself back in to my own worldâ€”rather a touch & go proceeding: but its no use getting worried; the end must come. & whether its good or bad, Heaven knows.
