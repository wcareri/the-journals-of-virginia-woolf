### Friday 19 July

No. I go on getting preliminary headaches. It is no good trying to do the last spurt, which should be much like a breeze in the heavy elms, these last days here: yes, a wind blowing in the trees that are thick with green leaves. For there must be movement as well as some weight, something for the breeze to lift. And we have Edith & Eddie Playfair, & Ottoline & Julian & Quentin tonight.

Yesterday we went to tea with Mr & Mrs Standgroom. Coming out we said, no, L. had the technical phraseâ€”but I cant remember itâ€”that they have the world they want. Bedroom suites are made for them; all Tot. Court Road is theirs; the world is to their liking. And gramophones & cases of cutlery & table centres. All this they have & enjoy, genuinely, without any shyness. Standgroom is a wizened parched little man, under her thumb, a clerk in the Customs, who deals with tea. I thought them rather engaging, so pleased with having what everyone has. And Miss B. as she wishes to be called, is quite on top of the situation. Patted my shoulder. No snobbishness. No sense of class differences. And science has helped them to electric toasters: I mean their life materially is much freer & easier than ours at Hyde Park Gate. The only room she did not show us was the W.C. We saw her wedding dressâ€”a pale pink. She does not mean to have children.
