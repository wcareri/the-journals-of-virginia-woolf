### Tuesday 23 April

Kingsley coming at eleven of our first fine morning & staying till 6 has completely taken away any power I may have over the art of fiction. In order to ensure myself 2 hours of silence & air I went off to Moggery Poke. I passed 2 really happy women sitting on the slope of Itford hill. As they smiled at me, I thought I would act the scene of Eleanor & the builderâ€”went to them & said Did you speak? No they had not spoken. But they were very happy. I then went onâ€”but it was a grey morningâ€”to Moggery: & home by the river. And there was K. eating cold veal & sweeping up his cauliflower on his fork. An effusive slippery mind: always on the fizz: but how undistinguished! How without hardness or fineness of texture! & now of course all dissolved by personal anxieties into a chatter of egotism: â€œIs there anything more we can say about my affairs?â€ he remarked at 3. No, I said to myself, there is nothing more. For he had been flooding us with damp proof sheetsâ€”sticky with printers inkâ€”all the morning. Should he stay or should he go? I could only amuse myself by probing the depths of his belief in the N.S. Directly I minimised its importance, he trotted out arguments to prove its immense value to the world. The only paper that tells the truth, the stay & bread of all the serious minded in Britain. Then, directly Iâ€™m alone with him, its his arthritis. True, heâ€™s not quite in his right mind; but how tiring this shambling through the hot sand is! & how undistinguishedâ€”well meaning, good hearted, I doubt not, but self obsessed; with no ear or eye; no reflective faculty & catching at any straw to float on; talking profusely; sociable because afraid of being alone; with no core of truth or substance in him; garrulous, untidy, slovenly; â€˜ableâ€™ as they say, quick to snatch, a snapper up of trifles, uninterestingâ€”yes, a profoundly uninteresting man. Yet, Aberystwith is ready to pay him Â£1000 a year: so he must have some merchantable quality. But it is like reading a living newspaper, talking to K. He is full of short snippets. And why so dull? He runs off my mind like a torrent of lukewarm water, but leaves it stained & tired. It is like listening to a perpetual leading article, so admirable, so well meaning, so shallow.
