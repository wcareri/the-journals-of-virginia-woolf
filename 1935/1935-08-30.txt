### Friday 30 August

For a wonder, my head is clear, & my hand does not shake; but then Iâ€™ve been doing the Law Courts passage, which went easily: an upper air passage. Now the book seems to me very good.

Last night they sung the Belgian anthem at the Prom: out of respect for the Queen: & after that, the news-reader announced, in his most penetrated with respectful sorrow voice, the death of the Queen in a motor accident. The car ran off the road into a tree, & she was flung out; struck her head. The King kissed her, as she died â€œ& as I could not do anything, I went onâ€ says the most trustworthy observer, a passer by, this morning. That, in its way is a tragedy. Mr Baird had a fit after having tea at Southease. I distemperedâ€”the colour is too blue, but better than the green; then we walked to the river, played bowls, & now expect, alas, as Iâ€™m in the swim, a teaparty of the most ferocious description, & its a blowing rainy cold day too; the Wolves, Hugh Jones, Angelica & Eve. Not much pleasure to be had, & a tired brain tomorrow; but as I often sayâ€”what do I often say? Something to the effect that one must sweep it all up in oneâ€™s stride, even as a matter of art. Could I be alone, & write & walk & read, perhapsâ€”but no, I admit the thought at the moment has nothing but heavenly delight in it. As it is, off to Lewes, buying cakes; arrange the room; put the kettle on, & say to Mrs W. Mind the steps.
