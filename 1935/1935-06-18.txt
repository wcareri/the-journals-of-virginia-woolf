### Tuesday 18 June

Yesterday, instead of reading Tomâ€™s Murder in the Cathedral, which, having run through & tested my colour sense, I expect to be good, I had to give Ralph Brewster tea. Curious teeth; gooseberry coloured staring eyes; & an air of nervous instability. Large hands, hanging: only just neat enough to have tea. A sudden amused kindling in the gooseberry eyes; & the profuse storytelling of those who have lived with savages. Would go on & on & on.
