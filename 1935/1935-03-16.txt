### Saturday 16 March

I have had 3 severe swingeings lately: Wyndham Lewis; Mirsky; & now Swinnerton. Bloomsbury is ridiculed; & I am dismissed with it. I didnt read W.L.; & Swinnerton only affected me as robin affects a rhinocerosâ€”except in the depths of the night. How resilient I am; & how fatalistic now; & how little I mind, & how much; & how good my novel is; & how tired I am this morning; & how I like praise; & how full of ideas I am; & Tom & Stephen came to tea, & Ray & William dine; & I forgot to describe my interesting talk with Nessa about my criticising her children; & I left outâ€”I forget what.

My head is numb today & I can scarcely read Osbert on Brighton, let alone Dante. Why did Heinemann send me Sâ winnerton? to hurt me? And that does hurt 2 seconds. And Rebecca West did answer yesterday, & signs yours ever, & had been ill, & no secretary, so thats done with. And its a warm day, & I wont remind L. that we might have gone to Rodmell. Where shall we go? How happy I am. Tomâ€™s writing a play about T a Becket to be acted in Cy Cathedral. Asks us to teaâ€”very easy & honest & kind to Stephen. Said he wrote the last verses of Wâ aste Land in a tranceâ€”unconsciously. Said he could not like poetry that had no meaning for the ear. Read lacking in sensuality. Poor Stephen so hurt by reviews of Vienna that he told Tom to withdraw it. Tom advises him to abstain from poetry for a time. Stephen generously praised Day Lewis. Grown heavier, less self-confident. And thats all I can twitter (Swinnertonâ€™s word for meâ€”but: then he admires Mary Webb) this morning. Brighton forward.

In last weeks Time & Tide St John Ervine called Lytton â€œthat servile minded man â€¦. that Pandarâ€ or words to that effect. Iâ€™m thinking whether, if I write about Roger, I shall include a note, a sarcastic note, on the Bloomsbury baiters. No, I suppose not. Write them downâ€”thats the only way.
