### Wednesday 30 October

By way of a symptomâ€”just because, reaching for a book, I opened my first draft of What are we to do & read the first page, I cannot settle to The Years save by dint of severe prodding. My mind is once more flooded with the desire to be at that argument. It is true that this was, I suppose, suggested by having Miss Whiteâ€”nice not very highly intelligent but fresh, with a prominent nose, & eyes that oddly changed from hard to softâ€”to tea: (a New Zealander; her father a doctor; has been ranging about the world in Cargo steamers; now lives in a flat at Highgate)â€”then Miss Lynd, & Adrian & William to dinner. So that no doubt my nerve tension is loosened & twangs slightly. Anyhow, here is my hour for reading Roger or a tiresome half good half bad MSâ€”wasted in mind spinning. A very fine October day.

Went to Peace Conference, by way of a joke, yesterday, & saw several baboon faced intellectuals; also some yearning, sad, green dressed negroes & negresses, looking like chimpanzees brought out of their cocoanut groves to try to make sense of our pale white platitudes. I took some notes; walked across the Green Park; bought a little Italian frame for 7/6. The woman said (when I only had 5/) â€œI can trust youâ€”yes, for two days. And if you dont pay me, well then bad luck to youâ€. So home just in time to put buns in the oven for Miss White, who said, â€œOh but you see this isnâ€™t just visiting a publisher. It is seeing two famous peopleâ€ & she stayed getting more at her ease, till 6.30. Then my Gray (3 volumes) had come; but I had no time to cut it, for at 8 the party began, & they stayed till 12.45. And then Lynd couldnâ€™t get her motherâ€™s new car to start, & Aâ . forgot his keys & came back to find them. A. very spruce lively & witty. We hit it off when other people are there. I have an impression that he is far more social than he wasâ€”staying away with the Lintotts. Miss L. rather too â€˜dressedâ€™ in red plush, with one jewel, & dark hair. Not clear cut enough about the nose & lips, a little brushed with the Lynd, I mean the professional scribbler, Priestley, Walpole brush. She said that Squire now runs about wonâ€™t do anything, drinks, & has deposited Lady S. in a small ugly house in Hampstead, being no longer the old country gentleman, but merely what he was originallyâ€”that is a scallywag. Mind I suppose all rubbed away by his scribblingâ€”if he ever had one, which L. denies. Now today we have to go to tea with Mrs W: tomorrow Cliveâ€™s lunch; then Mâ onks House & a meeting in the schoolroom; & on Monday I have to go to the BBC out of sheer curiosity, to hear a record which I have no intention of supplying. No answer from the P.E.N. I must note that not to be answered is far more crushing than to be answered. Even more than the usual shower of anti-Fascist leaflets. I go up & find that the Americans demand that I shall cable at their expense.
