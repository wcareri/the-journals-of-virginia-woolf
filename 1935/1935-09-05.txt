### Thursday 5 September

Iâ€™ve had to give up writing The Yearsâ€”thats what its to be calledâ€”this morning. Absolutely floored. Sally in bed. Cant pump up a word. Yet I can see, just, that somethings there; so I shall wait, a day or two, & let the well fill. It has to be damned deep this timeâ€”740 pages in it. I think, psychologically, this is the oddest of my adventures. Half my brain dries completely; but Iâ€™ve only to turn over, & thereâ€™s the other half, I think, ready, quite happily to write a little article. Oh if only anyone knew anything about the brain. And, even today, when Iâ€™m desperate, almost in tears looking at the chapter, unable to add to it, I feel Iâ€™ve only got to fumble & find the end of the ball of stringâ€”some start off place, someone to look at Sara perhapsâ€”no, I dont knowâ€”& my head would fill & the tiredness go. But Iâ€™ve been waking & worrying. Bothered about Liâ€™s indigestion & his loss of weight, with the apple picking & the Cttee meeting autumn coming on.

A very sensational voice on the loudspeaker last night. Mâ ussolini closes the door. Deep disappointment. What next? &c. But the papers this morning are less melodramatic, & incline to think that the affair will drag on undecided for some time. I was also in a stew about war & patriotism last night. And when it comes to my thinking about my country! Thank God, John Baileyâ€™s life is out, & I shall seek consolation there. And write about Mrs Lindbergh?
