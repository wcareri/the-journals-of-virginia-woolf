### Friday 13 September

What a combination for the superstitious! Driving off to visit Margaret & Lilian at Dorking; & I have got into a mild flood I think with The Ps Years. The difficulty is always at the beginning of chapters or sections where a whole new mood has to be caught plumb in the centre.

Richmond accepts my Marryat & thanks me for his poor little knighthood! L. is made all rigid by that dâ€”d fool Brewster & his complaints about the photographs. To make matters worse, Dr Mary Gordon rings up to bother us about her life of the Ladies of Llangollen; & it has turned grey & windy. Am I to ask Angelica or not? These are my troubles, as the man said â€¦ Yesterday L. took the car in; (but Iâ€™m making up scenes: this began in the middle of last night). Then we walked to Lewes, & found the new way, after all these years, by the Canal, under the Bridge. And home to bowls, & veal cutlets. Reading Love for Love, Life of Anthony Hope, &c. A man could live on Â£200 at Oxford if he lived at home.
