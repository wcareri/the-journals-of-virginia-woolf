Tea with Tom yesterday. A small angular room, with the district railway on one side, Cornwall Gardens on the other. A great spread; rolls in frills of paper. A dark green blotting paper wall paper, & books rather meagre, stood on top of each other; bookcases with shelves missing. Not a lovely room. A coloured print from an Italian picture. Nothing nice to look at. Purple covers. Respectable china â€œA presentâ€ said Tom; he was perched on a hard chair. I poured out tea. There was Mrs Munro, a handsome swarthy Russian looking woman in a black astrachan cap. And it was heavy going. All about cars; the jubilee; publishing; a German boy; a little literary gossip; feet conscientiously planting themselves in the thick sand; & I not liking to go too soon, & so sitting till we were all glad when Mrs M. got up, & Tom was glad, & showed us his bedroomâ€”a section, getting the railway under it. â€œI forgot to ask you to drink sherryâ€ he said, pointing to sherry & glasses on the bedroom window sill. A pallid very cold experience. He stood on the stepsâ€”it is the Kensington Rectory & he shares a bath with curates. The hot water runs very slowly. Sometimes he takes the bath prepared for the curates. A large faced pale faced manâ€”our great poet. And no fire burning in any of us. I discover a certain asperity in him towards the womanâ â€”a priestly attitude. Here he gets warmed up a little. But the decorous ugliness, the maid in cap & apron, the embroidered cloth, the ornamental kettle on the mantelpiece all somehow depressed me. And as I say it was a bitter cold day & we have seen too many literary gents. How heavenly to sleep over the fire! Tomâ€™s was a gas fire.

A long letter from Vita, by the way, about Ethelâ€™s attack on her. She asks me why? Happily I can truthfully say I told her not to write. At the same time I agree with Ethelâ€™s opinion of that menage more than I like (see whichever page it is). And I think E. though V. tries to think her absurd, has said something true, in her violent unnecessary way. But whats the use?
