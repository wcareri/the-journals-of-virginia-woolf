### Saturday 3 August

With that remark of Ottâ€™s about not reading Shre in India I broke off my London summer abruptly; though it chattered itself out in great style with a dinner to John Lehmannâ€”a reconciliation dinnerâ€”& the Busseys, at which he laughed so loud & free that my restraint went; & I talked French to Simon, & went round to the Bussys & saw Clive like a white robin redbreast, all got up going to a party at the Courtaulds: but I do it very seldom, he said in a huff, when Simon chaffed him. â€œMon cherâ€”vous etes arrivÃ©.â€

So the summer ended; & now opens again here, with Nessa back; Charleston in being, though rather intermittent, with Duncan in Rome still, Clive going to Greece, Julian to China, & Nessa proposing to paint the Queen Mary in London. And the harvest is positively orange on the hill, & the country divinely coloured ripe ashcoloured & gold, as I came through Tristramâ€™s Grove up the river.

Nessa came about a cable to China; & we called in at Charleston to suggestâ€”what its no use foraging in my rather dissipated mind to find. For, by way of a jaunt from the bookâ€”the unchristened bookâ€”I took a flight into Marryat thisâ€”& here I broke off, to go & dredge the pond I think.
