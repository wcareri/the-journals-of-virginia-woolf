### Tuesday 26 February

A very fine skyblue day, my windows completely filled with blue for a wonder. Mr Riley has just mended them. And I have been writing & writing & re-writing the scene by the Round Pond. What I want to do is to reduce it all so that each sentence though perfectly natural dialogue has a great pressure of meaning behind it. And the most careful harmony & contrast of sceneâ€”the boats colliding &câ€”has also to be arranged. Hence the extreme difficulty. But I hope perhaps tomorrow to have done, & then the dinner party & Kitty in the country should go quicker. At least I find the upper air scenes much simpler: & I think its right to keep them so. But Lord what a lot of work still to do! It wont be done before August. And here I am plagued by the sudden wish to write an Anti fascist Pamphlet. L. & I, after snarling over my cigarette smoking last night (Iâ€™m refraining altogether & without difficulty today) had a long discussion, about all the things I might put in my pamphlet. He was extremely reasonable & adorable, & told me I should have to take account of the economic question. His specialised knowledge is of course an immense gain, if I could use it & stand away: I mean in all writing, its the personâ€™s own edge that counts. Cory to tea.
