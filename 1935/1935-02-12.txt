### Tuesday 12 February

This should be the coldest day in the year, according to averages; & it was a bitter week end & L. had a cold & I had the divine good sense to suggest staying till Monday; & Monday, when we drove up at midday was the first day of spring. We lunched at Reigate & the marmoset attracted great attention; the well of nice middle class women is bottomless; & the two men, who were talking about the mystery of razors, â€œI had a clean shave on Saturday â€¦ but this morning with the same razorâ€¦â€ & then about the County Court, poison, & the legal status of Kingswood, being I suppose small solicitors, said Might I ask you, Sir, what that animal is? Then we came home; then Robson came to tea, & let out a number of highly sensible remarks about the rents of houses. He hasâ€”incredible though it may seemâ€”actually, in 3 minutes, taken a perfect house in Westbourne Terrace, at an absurdly low rent, & the house, being faced with stone, not stucco, will be very cheap to repair: also the landlord is responsible for structural repairs: Willie is expecting â€œan addition to the family shortlyâ€. A marvellous feat: one supposes his gestation must be as long as an elephants. He retired to L.â€™s room. Colefax then came half an hour late: & we had it out. Lord what a drubbing you gave me in the summer, I managed to thrust in, after the usual patter about dining last night with somebody who had been dining with Ll. George. Then her defences crumpled: she flushed & quickened; so did I. She sat on the floor by the way, & pulled down some white undergarment which had become creased. She only wears one under garment & a small belt, by the way. And she twittered out how what had hurt her had been my thinking, or insinuating, that her dinner was merely a snob dinner to bring celebrities together. The truth was Noel adores me; & I could save him from being as clever as a bag of ferrets & as trivial as a perch of canaries. And of course, I rather liked her. And she is so childishly ready to patter about her own simple love of sunsets, comparing herself to the worldlyâ€”for example Christabel & Lady Cholmondeley. That I stubbed by saying I admired & loved those who fill their sails with the spice breezes of the great world. So she had to trim & hedge; & admit that parties are a stimulus to the imagination; & that her chief pleasure is to tell herself stories, to make up a life, a picture, as she bustles & flits. This I think was intended to be in my mannerâ€”a tribute to the imaginative, artistic life: for indeed what she cant bear is to be rated a hard society woman: as she is, partly; but then weâ€™re all curates eggs, as I was feeling: a mix: when L. came in & the political situation, was again to the fore. â€œI was in Manchester last week â€¦ a cotton manufacturer told me that now Mosley has no chance in the North.. He has, I know for a fact, to shut down several branches. And heâ€™s very hard up.â€ So she went & we kissed in the hall.

This morning Mabelâ€™s brother in law, Mr Shine, said, about my studio windows, â€œTheres the force, the push, & the fitâ€”to use engineering terms.â€ This was to show us his intellectual eminenceâ€”a nice honest eyed false toothed man, who shines in the Labour world, & cant get a job. So I will keep this phrase for Mr Duffus.
