### Tuesday 5 November

A specimen day, yesterday: a specimen of the year 1935 when we are on the eve of the Duke of Gloucesterâ€™s wedding: of a general election: of the Fascist revolution in France: & in the thick of the Abyssinian war: it being mild warm November weather; at 2.30 we went to the BBC & listened to some incomparable twaddleâ€”a soliloquy which the BBC requests me to imitate (a good idea, all the same, if one were free) with all the resources of the BBC behind one: real railway trains; real orchestras; noises; waves, lions & tigers &c; at 3. we reach Dorland Hall; a loudspeaker proclaiming the virtues of literature, the Princess Louise having just declared the show open & said that books are our best friends. There we meet old stringy Rose Macaulay, beating about, like a cat a hawking odds & ends; Gerald Duckworth, covered with small prickly red squares, as if he had fallen on his face in a bramble bush; (Fisher) Unwin; & so out: home; at 5.15: telephone; the Baroness Nostitz has arrived early; will we see her now; up she comes; a monolithic broad faced Hindenburg, bulky; cant get in or out of my chair; says Germany is the better for Hitler;â€”so they say: but of course Iâ€™m not a politician: I want to get some young man to lecture on English poetry; has a rather hard, dominating impassive eye: slow, stately; must have been a beauty; statuesque; aristocratic. Then a card: in comes the Indian; stays till 7.30. was turned out of a carriage in Bengal.

Thats an Indian! the lady cried  
If you dont go, I shall kick you.

He jumped out, happily into bushes, as the train was going 15 miles an hour. Liberty, justice. A girl who shot at the Governor. Hatred of the British rule. Still, its better than the Italian. Mss is paying their fare & hotel bills in order to get them to side with him. You are our allies. The British will be kicked out. And now Morgan rings upâ€”what about Jules Romains? Will you meet him. May I lunch to discuss the French question. And so we go on.

Another specimen day.
