### Sunday 26 May

We went rag marketing. & suddenly out sprang, to my eyes, the old triumphant Vanessa of early married days. Why? How she would bear off in full sail with Roger Clive & me attendant. We bought pots; & a tea set, which gave her great intense potters delight more than any clothing or jewel.

And then? Iâ€™m writing at Aix; on a Sunday evening, with a band playing & stopping, & children shouting, in a too luxurious hotel where the waiters bring one the menu, & I mix my French scandalously with odd scraps of my painfully acquired Italian. Still I can rattle off Gli Indifferenti lying on my bed for pleasure. Oh the loveliness of the land still here & thereâ€”for instance that first morningâ€™s drive out of Romeâ€”the sea & the lip of the inviolated land; & the umbrella pines, after Civita Vecchia: then of course all the intense boredom of Genoa & the riviera, with its geraniums & its bouganvilia, & its sense of shoving you between hill & sea & keeping you. there in a bright luxury light without room to turn, so steep the vulture neck hills come down. But we slept at Lerici the first night which does the bay the brimming sea & the green sailing ships & the island & the sparkling fading red & yellow night lamps to perfection. But that kind of perfection no longer makes me feel for my penâ€”Its too easy. But driving today I was thinking of Rogerâ€”Brignollesâ€”CorgÃ©sâ€”my word, the olives & the rust red earth, & the flat green & the trees.

But now the band has begun again, & we must go down to dine sumptuously off local trout. Off tomorrow, & home on Friday. But though Iâ€™m impatient for my brain to eat again, I can dally out these last days better than sometimes. Why? why? I go on asking myself. And feel I could soon polish off those final scenes: a possible amplification of the first paragraph occurred to me. But I dont want to grind at â€˜writingâ€™ too hard. To open my net wide. It occurs to me, as we drive, how Iâ€™m disliked, how Iâ€™m laughed at; & Iâ€™m rather proud of my intention to take the fences gallantly. But writing again!

Nessa you see, is always interrupted by Angelica, who has the social sense & not the contemplative. Goodbye, sweet dreams, she laughed as she waved us away on Thursday night on the Piazza di Spagna. And so she always interrupts & says, Mummy, if youâ€™re going out would you buy me some dark blue cotton. Oh yes. And then we must think about getting hair curlers. So she cant brood over pictures, which must be a divine refreshment. Never mind. Iâ€™m dipping into K.M.â€™s letters, Stendhal on Rome; & the Italian. Cant formulate a phrase for K.M. All I think a little posed & twisted by illness & Murry; but agonised, & at moments that direct flick at the thing seen which was her giftâ€”Then all the old Tchekov stuff about life; & the perpetual rather sordid worries & gibes, & the doll on the bed, which I detest, & something driven & forced to cram into one year the growth of five or six. So I cant judge & get
