In some ways, its rather like writing The Wavesâ€”these last scenes. I bring my brain to a state of congestion have to stop: go upstairs, run into towsled Mr Brewster; come back; find a little flow of words. Its the extreme condensation: the contrasts: the keeping it all together. Does this mean that its good? I feel I have a round of great pillars to set up, & can only drag & sweat. Itâ€™s something like that. Its getting barer & more intense. And then what a relief when I have the upper air scenesâ€”like the one with Eleanor! only they have to be condensed too. Its the proper placing that strains me.

Pannickar & Morgan last night; rather difficult. P. so bubbling, always talking with a smile, swart & greased, like some animal with a thick pelt & very white teeth. Then Morgan, evanescent, piping, elusive, settling exactly there. Had been lunching with Rebecca; giving away prizes. My bones achedâ€”that cold field picnic at Glynde I suppose. And Morgan divined that we would not come to Paris. Always divines the meaning & then flits off. As a matter of fact, P. had stolen 2 books of his. He did not like him. M. has a razor edge to his mind. And he cant get on with â€œBloomsburyâ€ & feels, I guess, unattached, & thus takes on public work, which depresses him.

Ought I to go & see R. West? I want to for some reasonâ€”partly about fascism. Clive rang up this morning. We dine there tonight. L. says â€œyourâ€ cook! which annoys me. She must go, I suppose.

Thenâ€”I will now go on with the F. Queen. & finish it. The mood has come back.
