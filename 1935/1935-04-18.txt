This is written with very dirty hands after tidying up. We go after lunch. But shall we be alone? I doubt it. I foresee Julian, Wigram & Kingsley Martin, who again rang up, is now inclined to go to Aâ berystwyth: but L. bets that he will stay at the N.S. And he saidâ€”I listened inâ€”Suppose Iâ€™m walking on the Downs, might I come & see you? Oh God, I thought, divining that he has a craving for our societyâ€”that is to talk about himself. â€œOr do you want to be alone?â€ L. who is his confessor, said, as confessors must, damn them, No do come. And physically heâ€™s so repulsive. A fineish sort of day. I bought a coffee mill at Fortnum yesterday, & going to look for lamps saw Derrick Leon, advising customers about fabrics in their wholly disgusting room, all strewn with luxury objects in the worst most opulent heartless brainless taste: women in black with white pearls & red lips. The atmosphere of a rich princely shop is not sympathetic. A kind of halfway house: a shop not a shop; shop people pseudo gentry: an attempt to seduce & coerce. The chimney lamp was 25/6 instead of 19 18/9 as at the Stores. Six shillings to pay for lipstick & scent & carpets & the casual gentlemanly manners of Mr Marshall & the strew & the carelessness. I watched a gentleman selling Easter eggs with powder puffs, to the head buyer, who might have been Christabel.

And so home. And no one came, & that was one of Gods blessings. And Iâ€™m fidgetting, getting ready. Miss West doesnt get on with Belsher; is spending Easter at Folkestone, which she dislikes. But Miss Walton is going to Amsterdam.
