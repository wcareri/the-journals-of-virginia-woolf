### Tuesday 26 March

A very nice dinner at MacCarthyâ€™s last night. Desmond flung the door open & almost kissed me. But thats not our formula. So glad to see usâ€”He looks firmer & pinker. And there was Hope & Dermod & Molly gay & amiable & not so deaf. And we talked of America. Very kind, quite untaught. D. never allowed to pay. He had enjoyed himself immensely, only netted Â£150 though. And he was concerned about the attacks on Lytton & says Swinnerton has a grudge because he is selfmade. This had annoyed him more than us (a vindication of me is in the Times this morning; so we score of course by being attacked & saying nothing.) Molly as I say affectionate, very happy & prosperous all the Mâ acCarthyâ s. I think: Dermod now a doctor, a weak looking but somehow alert & alive young man, discussing germs with L.; Hope on a diet of course. He put matches on the floor to represent germs. I couldnâ€™t burrow into Desmond as Molly had to be supplied. Dear me, friendship is a very happy thing. And nothing needs to be said. And I forgetâ€”We took Hope to her little Close, behind the Oratory, like a scene in the Meister-singers. We discussed the case of Harry Norton; the effect of discouragementâ€”what Dâ esmond calls Almhousingâ€”the wish he has to retire & live on tea & bread alone in obscurity. But I said something always turns up, which is true. He had been lunching with Austen Chamberlain, who says Germany can only be treated like a slave: wont contemplate giving her anything. Patriotism is the devilâ€”yes.
