### Friday 31 May

Home again, & how queer, as we drove up there was Pinkaâ€™s basket being carried up by Percy, & she had died yesterday: her body was in the basket. Just as we were saying that we would see her in a moment. Percy was very red, very sad, screwed his eyes up, would not smile at us, & then told us. So thats whats bound to happen we said. A very silent breakfast. I had been saying how she would put out my match & all the usual jokes. And the intensity of the sense of deathâ€”even for a dogâ€”how oddâ€”our feeling of her character, & the grotesquenessâ€”something pathetic, & the depression, & the I suppose fear of sentimentality & so on.

A cold misting day: Pinkaâ€™s feet by the way on my blotting paper. The usual tremor & restlessness after coming back, & nothing to settle to, & some good German woman sends me a pamphlet on me, into which I couldnt resist looking, though nothing so upsets & demoralises as this looking at ones face in the glass. And a German glass produces an extreme diffuseness & complexity so that I cant get either praise or blame but must begin twisting among long words. And so I must write letters. L.â€™s book is reviewed in the Lit. Sup. on the day it came out & seriously without a sneer, though not with much grasp. Never a bite in that senile paper.

The view as beautiful as any Iâ€™ve seen, by the way, even on a mud coloured day. The frost has nipped the fruit, the box hedges have yellow tops. Lady Rhondda asks us to dinner, & so the snake renews its skin. We drove through Normandy yesterday & it was Bank holiday owing to Ascension day, so that all the people were dressed in respectable black coats & fur. A more ugly tribute to the spirit could not be. We lunched on the balcony at Caudebec, & the Bank holiday crowd was lunching tooâ€”getting blotched & red in the face: taking out mirrors & rubbing red & white too profusely into lips & noses. An old man next us who had to be hoisted into his car after eating largely I suppose to return to Paris. A long row of cars waiting. Plethoric after their lunch & wine the holiday makers walked up & down looking at each otherâ€™s cars. We drove off too, got early to Dieppe, smelt the usual strong smells, gave the car up & settled down to the usual 4 or 5 hours till 10 in the hotel. Mitz provided a long discourse with the wife, daughter & motherâ€”3 generationsâ€”in the stuffy little office. The girl was translating Caesar. She must know languages, they said, & was to come to Newhaven to learn English. A great traditionâ€”French talk: I enjoyed the expressiveness of the old woman, describing Englishwomen during the war. She was in a shop, & they didnâ€™t know a word, but soon had the hang of itâ€”saying Pomme, then pomme de terre. Much more style to her than to a woman of her type in Lewes. I am writing to steady the fidgets, to cover over the depression. L. has begun work, & it is only eleven, & I cant take up my book. I think that an hour of reading some good author is prescribed.
