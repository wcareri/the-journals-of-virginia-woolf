### Tuesday 29 April

I should be tidying the room, but Iâ€™m not. Everything scattered with winters soot & cigarette ash. The great joy of having money is that one can buy small treats for the journeyâ€”new shoes. And even give way to the temptation of a 30/- dress. Murray came & I tactfully showed him the blue taffeta; our relations are an odd mix of the friendly & employed. He gave me this blouse, so I gather. But he will dress me for the part of the Dss of Malfi, even in day clothes.

A long letter of enthusiasm from Mrs Ellis Roberts; her husband is writing on me to emphasize my heart, which Swinnerton denied. Dear me. I thought W. Lewis said I was sentimentalâ€”between the 3 of them!

But I was about to say that everything is a little slack now Iâ€™m not writing. Odd to be off that wave. But I want to experiment with pure external living for a monthâ€”looking sharing, taking in ideas & impressions And then watch how the old trout at the bottom of the pond rise. I predict that the desire to write will become so frantic by the time were on the way back that I shall be making up all along the French roads. At the moment I start an idea but it fades; cant write it without feeling my brain stretched; cant even write to Stephen Spender about his book. A fine spring morning, very quiet, birds chirping, all London busy wrapping up parcels for the Jubilee.
