And Iâ€™ve just written it all over again. But it must do this time, I say to myself. Yet I know that I must put the screw on & write some pages again. Its too jerky: too. Its obvious that one person sees one thing & another another: & that one has to draw them together Who was it who said, through the unconscious one comes to the conscious, & then again to the unconscious? I rather think it was Miss West about childrens drawings last night at tea. I rather suspect she wanted to be an artist. Anyhow she knew McKnight Kauffer when he was married, & told us a very discreditable story about him. Hence I suspect his extreme fawning & flattery when we meet, & my vague discomfort. A pouring wet day, after yesterdays sun; & our balmy walk across the Park to Harrods: & nobody has written to me, & Iâ€™m neglected, & Iâ€™m as safe as a sandboy; as a toad in an oak tree; & my window wont shut. Hence the draught.

I now feel a strong desire to stop reading Fâ aery Qâ ueen: to read Ciceroâ€™s letters, & the Chateaubriand Memoirs. As far as I can see, this is the natural swing of the pendulum. To particularise, after the generalisation of Romantic poetry.
