### Sunday 14 April

Let me make a note that it would be much wiser not to attempt to sketch a draft of On Being Despised, or whatever it is to be called, until the P.s is done with. I was vagrant this morning & made a rash attempt, with the interesting discovery that one cant propagate at the same time as write fiction. And as this fiction is dangerously near propaganda, I must keep my hands clear.

Its true Iâ€™m half asleep, after the Zoo & Willy. But he threw some coals on my fire: the horror of the legal profession: its immense wealth; its conventions: a Royal Comn. now sittingâ€”its hidebound hoariness, & so on; worth going into one of these days; & the medical profession & the osteopathsâ€”worth a fling of laughter. But oh dear, not now. Now for Alfieri & Nash & other notables: so happy I was reading alone last night. We saw the great dumb fish at the Zoo, & the Gorillas. Storms of rain, cloud: & I read Annie S. Swan on her life with considerable respect. Almost always this comes from Auâ tobiographâ y: a liking, at least some imaginative stir: for no doubt her books, which she cant count, & has no illusions about, but she cant stop telling stories, are wash, pigs, hogsâ€”any wash you choose. But she is a shrewd capable old woman.
