### Thursday 25 April

Whether it was Kingsley or not, the usual headache wings its way about me, rather like a fowl soaring & settling & giving me a peek in my back: clouding my mind. I think I have earned a headache & a holiday. But it remains cold. And I am not going to write a word of fiction till June 1st. Weak coffee, this morning, a badly cleaned fish; which L. visits upon the Cow, who cooked us an admirable dinner last night all the same. Must she go? An inveterate instinctive dislike on L.â€™s part, physical not rational. So cant be overcome. I can read Pirandello almost currently; but cant write, head begins protesting. I shall space my days quietly & buy clothes: no only shoes, I think.
