### Wednesday 20 March

Having just written a letter about Bloomsbury I cannot control my mind enough to go on with the P.s. I woke in the night & thought of it. But whether to send it or not, I dont know. But now I must think of something else. Julian & Helen last night. Helen much improved by her loss. Sweeter, softer, more sympathetic. We talkedâ€”I forgetâ€”easily enough, about Ha. Helen anti Ha, naturally. And Julian was twitchy but amiable. A hot spring day. Desmond rang up, asking us to dine.

L. advised me not to send the letter. And after 2 seconds I see he is right. It is better he says to be able to say we dont answer. But we suggest a comic guide to Bloomsbury by Morgan & he nibbles.
