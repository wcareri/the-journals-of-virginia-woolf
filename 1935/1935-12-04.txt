### Wednesday 4 December

I must take 10â€”no 5â€”minutes off before going up, & from reading Roger to Helen. I read & read & the packets hardly lessen, & I think of love, & L. & me; & the different lives. Yesterday Day Lewis wrote that his agent advises him to leave us for a larger firm, as he must make money. This revives the question of the Pressâ€”once again, once again. We both said walking at Caen Wood yesterday, we will now decide on a date & stop it. Yes: reading Roger I want to be free to travel as he was: free of MSS. Yet how keep our books? Or shall we try to hand it on to an intelligent youth? I rather doubt if such exist, or able to run it alone, & then we should still be tied. Raining. A lovely perfectly filled day yesterday: walk; alone; Romeo & Juliet in the evening. How fresh, rich, various colouredâ€”& then think of the pale New England morality murder.
