Moulins  
And here we are in yet another hotel, this time with a bath. Last night at Vienne. No bath. Water cut off by town. A great bath for common washing supplied by the squash eyed manager. Very good local dinner: crayfish: a comm. travellers hotel, also patronised by lower grade officers, who discuss military tactics & flirt with waitress. Sugar, always sweetened by the hands of a woman; All this taken philosophically by a huge black lady ladling out sour milk.

Some were dingy old governesses in spectacles, others professors with beards; there was one flashy adventuress; but most were small business menâ€”only rather, not very vicious. It was a blazing hot Sunday morning about 12, & this, we thought is the way our culture spends its holidays. Vicious, dull, & outside lurid. So on.
