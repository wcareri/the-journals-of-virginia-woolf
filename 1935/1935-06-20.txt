### Thursday 20 June

I am so oppressed by the thought of all the books I have to write that my head is like a bursting boiler. Half an hour ago, Margery Fry rang up to ask me to open an Exâ hibition of Rogerâ€™s paintings at Bristol; to speak for 15 minutes. Oh we should all love it! she said. Then it appeared that they are counting on me to write a life. She is collecting papers. This morning theres a book (in the Lit. Sup.) complaining that women have dropped their sacred task. This floods me with my Professions book. Helen tells me that the Stracheys are hurt that I never offered to write about Lytton. â€œBut I wanted to & they never asked me!â€ I said. Oh but they didnâ€™t like to suggest itâ€”James says they do want it. And here I am wedgedâ€”no, buoyantâ€”in a floating storm of scenes at the end of my book, which must be compacted & pulled out & turned & (this comes from my hair waving yesterdayâ€”from 2 to 4.45 & rather successful). And we are incessantly asked to dine lunch & â€˜seeâ€™ people.

Tom last night: supple & subâ tle, simple & charming. Stayed till 12.15. I never felt so much at my ease. He is a dear old fellow: one of â€˜usâ€™: odd: I felt I liked him as I liked Lytton & Rogerâ€”with intimacy in spite of God. First we talked of his play. He stayed with Lady Raleigh, & she gave him cocoa & Oliver biscuits but never said a word about the play. There was a canon there. And they looked out of the window & saw 3 girls in very short shorts, naked legs & large bottoms go into the Cathedral. â€˜â€˜The dean encourages themâ€ said Lady R. grimly. â€œI am in favour of St. Paul if one must be irrationalâ€ said Tom. Now tell me about the marmozets view of Germany.â€ We made a good dinner. And he said he liked Stephenâ€”â€œWhat a charming person in many waysâ€ no, I think he didnt even qualify his remark, so kind has he become. â€œAuden is a very nice rattled brained boy. Some of his plays extremely good, but its superficial: stock figures; sort of Punch figuresâ€¦â€ Publishers gossip. A story about a party to entertain the Reads, Ludo & her sister & German friend. Tom bought fireworks; sugar that dissolved & let out small fish; & chocolates that he thought were full of sawdust. â€œTheyre very greedy,â€ he said; â€œAnd by a mistake the chocolates were full of soap. They set on meâ€¦. And it was not a success. So much so that I forgot the fireworks, until they were going. I then let them off on the doorstep. And poor Herbert had to pay for a cab from Bina Gardens to Hampstead.â€ This was very amusing, & not as stiff as usual. L. made cigarettes. Tom drank whisky. I mused & was at my ease. Tom wants to give me all his works, but thought I didnt read themâ€”would always have given me all his works.
