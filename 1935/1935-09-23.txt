Reflections on Tom week end: that it is too long. Cant write. That he is more masterly; tells a story like one who has the right; is broader & bonier & more wild eyedâ€”long almond shaped eyesâ€”that he means to write modern verse plays: that he is self confident although going up Charleston Lane in the dark last night (Lottie advancing in her red jacket) he told me that he has no self confidence: Joyce has; but Joyce is interminably bored with everything. What can he do when heâ€™s finished this book? Perhaps thats why he procrastinates. We dined at Charleston. Nessa ordered eleven grouse, having doubled the number, thinking of them halved: Clive, Janie, Angelica & Eve. Acting. A. did not remember her part. We walked. Long silences. Bruce Richmond brooded over the week end. His week end: his rotund country gentleman ways: port hock bedroom candles; & telling little stories. Tom likes going there; is magisterially accepting new experiences. Likes, more than we do, respectability. Went to service at 8 on Sunday: a wet morning, & he heaâ [r]â d one old woman say to anotherâ€”in the churchyard, â€œAnd she was lying in bed with a still born child beside her.â€ But he did his duty. A very nice man, Tom; Iâ€™m very fond of Tom, & at last not much knocked off my perch by him. That is, not as I was when he came here & I was writing Jacobâ€™s. Room. Now he cant much disturb The Years, though he makes me feel that I want to write a play.
