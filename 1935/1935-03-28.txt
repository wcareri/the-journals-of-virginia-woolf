Another bridge between P.s & Dante. But I think I have actually done the Raid this morning. A nice quiet evening last night, L. at his Mitâ ; & I sitting reading over the fire. Nobody came for once. So that there is no call to make a noteâ€”unless to remind myself of the domestic atmosphere at the Mâ acCarthyâ s: Desmond as father: the sense of other lives growing & changing. I am bothered by tomorrows dinner though. Cant get anyone to meet the Morgans, yet fight shy of a solitary evening, wrongly perhaps. Raymond going to the Grand National. William has the flu. But this is not much of a roseleaf under the pillow after all. Spring triumphant. Crocuses going over. Daffodils & hyacinths out. Some chestnut leaves in the birds claw stage in the park. The country trees & Square trees bare still. Little bushes all green. I want to make vegetable notes for my book. How soft & springy & fresh the air was yesterdayâ€”like the sea! And I think of being abroad. But we have not yet decided where to go.
