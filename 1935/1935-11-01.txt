### Friday 1 November

Now again I pay the penalty of mixing fact & fiction: cant concentrate on The Years. I have a sense that one cannot control this terrible fluctuation between the 2 worlds. Take the past days: Mrs Bennett touching me on the shoulder in Kensington Gardens. â€œThis is Virginiaâ€™. A stocky little bright eyed girl in spectacles. Firing off bombs; but doesnt like the explosion. We talk about the name â€˜Virginiaâ€™. L. emerges from the Lavatory. We go to Mrs W.; very hot; Flora there; in come the Howes Mrs H. has collected 100 seals (glass: not animal) at Caledonian market. A good day when she only spends a penny: has sometimes to spend 2/- What for? Her only stimulusâ€”collecting glass seals. Mr H. walks. Off home. Ethel Sands asks me to see the Baroness Nostitz. Have to ring up & arrange to be back at 4.30. Cant get her.

Lunch with Clive. Desmond & Christabel. Confusion about Lottie & Dottie. We each sketched different characters; Lottie prehensileâ€”Oh dear me no, said Desmond, poor girl, sheâ€™s amassed thing after thing & cant order themâ€”Oh its Lottie youre talking about. Lord Bernersâ€™ Sapphist skit. No. You shall not waste your time on it. Lunch. â€œIâ€™ve been talking about Lytton,â€ dining with James. C. becomes emotional. Cant we put up a tablet to Francis. Saint & Wit. But where? Gerrard Street? Do we like monuments? Yes, she says. Clive chivalrously agrees. Then, just as I began to talk to Desmond, easily, about Santayanaâ€™s book, C. chips in: must read us the D. of Argyllâ€™s letter, (which I had read in book). This finished the lunch.

(And I forgot that Ka came the night before, all in red lace, & as usual determined to assert her dignity her importance her social value, so that we spent all the time trotting out acquaintances & honoursâ€”this she does whenever she emerges from Cornwall) Then home; Lady Howard & the Baroness for L.: then up to Maryâ â€™s, because she was hurt on the telephone that we hadnâ€™t written; Rothschilds & Aldous Huxleys; more talk; sticky at the end: A. says all this signing anti-Fâ ascist. rumpus is mere chitter chatter; got off on biology; Victor had a copy of Grayâ€™s Poper in red volume. I dont like that way of book buying & so home to bed & so cant even write this. Raining & we go to Rodmell where L. speaks. Yet its fluid & amusing in a wayâ€”not a patch on the other though. I must draw in for the last lap, would my friends allow.
