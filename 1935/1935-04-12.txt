### Friday 12 April

This little piece of rant wont be very intelligible in a years time. Yet there are some useful facts & phrases in it. I rather itch to be at that book. But I have been skirmishing round a headache, & cant pull my weight in the morning. It is now almost settled that we shall drive through Holland & Germany, concealing Leonardâ€™s nose, to Rome; & so back. A giant tour on our most heroic scale. Indeed, L. has just been in to say that we have to have the car tested this afternoon; also that the first of the spring flowers is upâ€”Mr Brace, alas. Day after day is thus blotted out.

Last night I dined with Nessa, L. being at Kingsleyâ€™s to hear the story of his divided mind. He cant make up his mind, & must display the separated parts, like a heaving oyster, to his friends. Sometimes thinks he is going mad. Everybody turns him. He makes up his mind to refuse Aberystwyth with Maynard: in comes Gerald Barry, pours scorn on journalism, K. seizes the telephone, rings up A.; says Is there still time to put my name forward? Next day the horror of A. descends on him. Goes to a psycho-analyst. Goes to Scilly Islands with his father, meets the Arnold-Forstersâ€”rings us up at 9 this morning; wants Cleano. Meanwhile Olga threatens divorce or claims itâ€”I forget whichâ€”& loves another, & is rejected & lives in Fitzroy Square. But I sat over the stove with Nessa & Duncan musing & rambling & discussing old Desmondâ€™s passions for American ladiesâ€”which is the reason why Molly seeks Freiburg for six months. And they were making plates on a new system, & off today to Stoke on Trent, & so Angelica dines hereâ€”a talented youngster the Star calls her, in a paragraph that seems founded on fact.

A wild wet spring. I had the courage to wear my silver corduroy. Lord, what a shivering coward I amâ€”but not as a writer. No. I stick to that by way of compensation.

Desmond received a deputation of his children in his room the other day to ask him to give up his love, for Mollyâ€™s sake. Upon which he said, that he thought he could assure them that it was the beginning of the end. The spit & image of Mr Micawber, as Nessa says. L. much upset by the inefficiency of electric lamps. I bought one at the Stores yesterday, for my travels, & it is too small to take an ordinary bulb. This is the kind of thing that genuinely annoys L. But I am merely running on, in order to waste the precious morning.
