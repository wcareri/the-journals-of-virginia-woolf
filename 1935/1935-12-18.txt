### Wednesday 18 December

Iâ€™ve had a bad morning at The Years, & feel it will spray off at the end. Thats I think because I had to see Mâ argery Fry, at Holland Park & missed my mooning airy easy afternoonâ€”the only soother of my tired head. So started making up in bed: so tired; & have to dine with Sands tonight. & Ethel Sâ myth. rings up at 8.30 inviting herself to lunch. Please God we shall set off on Friday: & dear old Morgan has his operation tomorrow. A cold fine day.
