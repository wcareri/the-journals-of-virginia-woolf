There is no doubt that the greatest happiness in the world is walking through Regents Park on a green, but wetâ€”green but red pink & blue eveningâ€”the flower beds I mean emerging from the general misty rainâ€”& making up phrases after a little stimulus from little Mr Murray among his clothes. He wants to become a scene maker, to design the decors for Straussâ€™s ballet. He was trained in the law at Edinburgh, but gave it up because some friends excited him about his designs. And now heâ€™s feeling a little at a dead end, & wants more scope. Why does this serve to start phrases, so that I left my bus, wasted 2d fare, & walked across Regents Park. Not that Iâ€™m fluent with my scene this morning; very difficult on the contrary. But Rome holds no greater excitement than this. So that Mabelâ€™s terrible faux pasâ€”she broke the gramophoneâ€”& Pinkaâ€™s death, are somehow obliterated. After dinner, however, that whining & complaining disreputable egomaniac, the Polish Count, rang up & bickered, discreditably. â€œI am boycotted by the entire literary world. Why I ask you does the N.S. allude to me as Montalk? Miss Rebecca West is the only writer who calls me Count Potockiâ€”â€ till L. became very trenchant & weighty & cut him off: but we were exacerbated. And I had a disagreeable letter from a stranger. You of course despise anyone who lives in an Avenue, you whoâ€™ve had a book written on your philosophy by a Frenchman. The inferiority complex is thick as a nettle bed. And I cant read Dante after a morning with my novelâ€”too hard.
