I open this book to record the fact, with all its psychological implications;â€”the fact that Rebeccaâ€™s snub has now worn off. It lasted about 4 days: gave me a cold goose feather feeling every morning & every evening. It will now gradually fade out; & I shall dismiss her, & all that is implicit in that situation. But I should still be very glad if she did write to me. On the other hand, the feeling of independence is even better than the feeling of pleasure would be.

O vanagloria dellâ€™umane posse,  
Comâ€™ poco verde in su la cima dura,  
se non Ã¨ giunta dall etati grosse!

O empty glory of human powers! How short the time its green endures upon the top, if it be not overtaken by rude ages!

Note: a reputation does not survive the generation in which it was built up, unless a gross & unenlightened age happens to followâ€”

Non Ã¨ il mondan romore altro che un fiato  
di vento, che or vien quinci ed or vien quindi,  
E muta nome, perchÃ© muta lato.

Earthly fame is but a breath of wind,  
which now cometh hence & now thence,  
And changes name because it changes direction.

a thousand years are a shorter space to eternity than the twinkling of an eye â€¦ Purgatorio. Canto XI. (p. 13 3).

A story Joyce Wethered told: there is a woman who was jilted by a man for a shop girl. She now spends her life going to shops & making the shop girls cry. She is a well known figure, & always does this. The girls at Fortnums are always crying: so are the men, but not so often. They cry because the head of the department says something that hurts their feelings. They are very badly paidâ€”girls Â£2 a weekâ€”men 3 or 4â€”& it leads to nothing. But they are always anxious to come.
