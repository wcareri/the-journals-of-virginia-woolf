What I have discovered in writing The Years is that you can only get comedy by using the surface layerâ€”for example, the scene on the terrace. The question is can I get at quite different layers by bringing in music & painting together with certain groupings of human beings. This is what I want to try for in the raid scene: to keep going & influencing each other: the picture; the music, & the other directionâ€”the actionâ€”I mean character telling a characterâ€”while the movement (that is the change of feeling as the raid goes on) continues.

Anyhow, in this book I have discovered that there must be contrast: one strata, or layer cant be developed intensively, as I did I expect in The Waves, without harm to the others. Thus a kind of form is, I hope, imposing itself, corresponding to the dimensions of the human being: one should be able to feel a wall made out of all the influences; & this should in the last chapter close round them at the party so that you feel that while they go on individually it has completed itself. But I havent yet got at this. Iâ€™m doing Crosbyâ€”an upper air scene this morning. The rest of going from one to another seems to me to prove that this is the right sequence for me at any rate. Iâ€™m enjoying the sequence, without that strain I had in The Waves.
