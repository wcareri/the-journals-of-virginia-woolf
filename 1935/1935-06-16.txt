### Sunday 16 June

So we drove to Winchendon through the rain. I was very numb in the head by the way & saw things at a great distance, which explains the bemused state, no impact, of my impressions. London spreads about 17 miles this way, suddently stops outside Rickmansworth at Moor Park, as if some great Lord still kept an estate. Then Amersham, with the house in the middle, rather like a peasant version of an Italian town; then a few bushyheaded woods; but always houses. At last we came to the gate, & there on the left in the green watery light were the children riding on copper coloured horses, going round under the trees; & Babs & Phil. And the talk began. They had found Cardinal Wolseyâ€™s arms in a rubbish heap: had them mounted into a mantelpiece. But it was badly done by the local stonemason: the fruit carving injured. Tea. Proper maid. Children drinking out of Jubilee mugs. â€œWe each have twoâ€ said Pippin who looks up under her eyes. Mary a straightnosed child Cecil sloping nosed. Talk about the great Gymkhana. Pâ . netted Â£500. All the stalls had paid. 7000 for tea. And so on. Babs has yellow front teeth; wears horn glasses. Then we walked past the wicked Lords house. But I dont like parks. And B. talked of horses; used to break them in, teach riding; loves horses; used to teach boys, running beside them; filled all pigsties & hutches with horses. Riding now a passion: all Woolworth girls ride before breakfast, have 2/- rides. This very hard on the horses. The man next them hired 20 hunters; hunting on the hire system. One goes lame, is sent back, another supplied by Smiths. Laughed at George & Flora: child not allowed to eat ices; wonâ€™t talk, spoilt; family gossip: all quite running, free, what I call â€˜natural livingâ€™. P. walked ahead & talked politics with L. Children tipped. Asparagus given, & so home: dine at 8.30: & I slept all the evening over the fire, & dreamt of cutting my hand in a theatre, & of a professional mistress of ceremonies who had to entertain people; & somehow Mrs Clifford came in; & I woke to find L. standing over me. And I have scrambled along this morning: & tonight we dine with Rhondda; but I am not going to Paris.
