### Wednesday 21 August

Up in London yesterday. And I saw this about myself in a book at the Timesâ€”the most patient & conscientious of artistsâ€”which I think is true, considering how I slave at every word of that book. My head is like a like aâ€”pudding, is itâ€”something that mildly throbs & cant breed a word at the end of the morning. I begin fresh enough. And I sent off the first 20 pages or so to Mabel yesterday.

Margery Fry comes on Friday with her hands full of papers, she says. Another book. Have I the indomitable courage to start on another? Think of the writing & re-writing. Also there will be joys & ecstasies though. Again very hot. I am going to re-paint this room. Went to Carpenters yesterdayâ€”chose chintzes. Is this worth writing? Perhaps.

Harvest all ready. Blackberries ripe. No mushrooms. Abyssinia. Cabinet summoned. Sitting today. Should I like to be old Baldwin? returning from Aix in this heat. L. has indigestion. Mitz spent the night on the free. Janie left the door open. We have our electric stove.
