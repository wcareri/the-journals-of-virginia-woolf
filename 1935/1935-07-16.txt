### Tuesday 16 July

A curious sense of complete failure. Margery hasnâ€™t written to me about my speech: according to Janie Pamela thought the whole thing a failure. And it was for this that I ruined my last pages! I cant write this morning. Cant get into the swing. Innumerable worries, about getting people to dine & so on, afflict me. My head is all jangled. And I have to get that dâ€”d speech printed, or refuse to. The director has written. Never again, oh never again!

I think though that I can get the last pages right, if I can only dream myself back into them. Yes, but how dream, when I have to see Susie & Ethel, to see Miss Belsherâ€™s house, to ring up, & write notes & order this & that? Well, be still & ruminate; its only 16th: theres a fortnight before August. And Iâ€™m sure that there is a remarkable shape somewhere concealed there. Its not mere verbiage, I think. If necessary I could put it away. But I think no: merely go on & perhaps write a very rapid short sketch, in inkâ€”thats a good plan. Go back & get the central idea, & then rocket into it. And be very controlled, & keep a hand on myself too. And perhaps read a little Shakespeare. Yes, one of the last plays: I think I will do that, so as to loosen my muscles. But oh this anxiety, & the perpetual knocking of the cup out of my hand.
