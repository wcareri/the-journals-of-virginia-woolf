### Sunday 10 November

Specimen days have somewhat relaxed later in the week. I seem to recall some walksâ€”a great deal of rain: the D & Dss of Gloucester driving through the Sqre: she bright & gay: he like Cory: & then I met the royal coach empty & noted the white bottoms of the postilions, & the rather sheepish look of the footmens faces in the daylight, all dressed up. Then, last night there was Day Lewis at the Book show, a man who makes queer faces; very nervous at first; with blurred eyes; a nice sensitive young man; but I think it would have been better read, his speech. All poets are misfits & therefore want communion with the common people. A good deal about the Trinity: some bite in him: to explain their desire to write not pure poetry butâ€”â€”? What exactly is poetry that is part the desire to communicate with the common people? Political poetry? Certainly its not easy, one word Wordsworth poetry. Instead of the Leech Gatherer the tank & poison gas. Yes. Too much theory: too little gift I think & too much public speaking. But then if he wants to be in touch with the common people he must talk at Book shows. Not very anxious I think to dine with us, for which I liked him. The usual hurry & scramble of literary gents: poor red scrannel faced Palmer, & Rose again hawking round the area railings for scraps. So to dine at Gennaroâ€”not very good; to N. Gallery moviesâ€”not very good; & home in the cold.

A letter from Bruce R. asking me to write more leaders; from Joe, asking me to write for The Listener. And L. says we are going to have a very lean year at the Press. I must consider money again for a momentâ€”how not to make too much or too little, & so on.
