The four old ladies sitting round the tea table at Aubrey House last night made me think of a nest of little rats.; Why? One got upâ€”Mrs Bridgesâ€”more pointed than the others. People say sheâ€™s like Lady Fry. Old Eliz? pours, tea; deaf; carpenters; once smoked when 9. Rachel brings out book about Aubrey House. Its a 17th Century house, like a college, with a quadrangle, trees. Long 18th Cent looking room; all shining: with the Dutch pictures collected by Mr Alexander. â€œIn this room there was gummed together the first petition for Womenâ€™s Rights. John Stuart Mill carried it to Parliament. The Peter Taylors had this house. Weâ€™ve had it for 60 years.â€ Some joke about one of the sisters not being yet 60. Three boxes of cigarettesâ€”â€œMy nephewsâ€. I sat over log fire with Mrs B. who said she cdnt write. Bâ  refused to have a Biogy. Used to put his feet on the mantelpiece & say â€œNow Iâ€™ll write a letter.â€ Did it first in pencil & then ink. Used to say things straight out. Roger very sensitiveâ€”used to stay with themâ€”a 3 cornered friendship. Didnt know his wifeâ€”she wore a check skirtâ€”not at my ease with herâ€”sorry about the quarrel over the pictures: R. minded very muchâ€”Well Iâ€™ve really nothing to tell you: Story of bowls at Failand. May we play bowls father? Robert wants to. Râ  asking Sir Edwardâ€™s permission.
