### Monday 20 May

Rome  
This is out of its place. Nor can I really flatter myself that I am going to float off the drive home from Cassenlinoâ  this eveningâ€”the women balancing blue green pots, the hot spring, green, blue & black precipitous mountain, flowersâ , umbrella pines, the town with the perched egg shell houses. And then, globed in the luminous light, for the sunset was pouring gold all over us, St Peters, to which we drove.

Is there any â€˜useâ€™ in such notes? Perhaps when the editing of the mind has gone further one can see & select better. Quentin bought an Italian paper & read of Lawrenceâ€™s death. Butted into a motorcycle. But I will now use the half hour left before they come to dinner to copy out from the pencil book that I keep in my bag to write it when taking in petrol, waiting for something or other. Again, whats the use, but that parrot cry would stifle most things.

Brenner. Monday 13th. Odd to see the countries change into each other. Beds now made of layers on top. No sheets. Houses becoming Austrian, dignified. Winter lasts at Innsbruck till July. No spring. Italy fronts one on a blue bar. The Cheko Slovaks are in front going to the customs house.

Verona. Written after drinking wine. I dont want to wake up. This is the lust that led many astray, but not comparable to my own private excitements. And it wears off so soon, even as I write, reason returns. I can see the world outside. The public: the grey green officer reading the paper. Queer what a part wine has played in human life. Omar &c. How all impressions are mixed. I am thinking of V.D. 30 years ago: Nessa: my honeymoon: Roger: I looking at Verona from the train. The sensation is of a tight band round the head tingling in the soles of the feet, hotness, & a spring: expanding.  
What would the writing of a complete drunkard be?  
A Turgenev novel at lunch. The diners cosmopolitan. A woman like Alice Clifford who asked that her ashes might be buried at sea.

Florence. Ash coloured houses with green doors. Smell of coffee roasting.

Perugia. Came through Florence todayâ€”Saw the green & white cathedral. & the yellow Arno dribbling into shallows. A thunderstorm. Irises purple against the clouds. So to Arezzo. A most superb church with dropped hull.

Lake Trasimen. Stood in a field of red purple clover: plovers egg lake, grey olives, exquisite, subtle, sea cold, shell green. So on, regretting that we did not stay, to Perugiaâ€”Brufani where we stayed in 1908. Now all the same. The same ardent sunburnt women. But lace & so on for sale. Better to have stayed at Trasimen. I went into an Albergo yesterday to buy rolls & found a sculptured fireplace, all patriarchalâ€”servants & masters. Cauldron on the fire. Probably not much change since 16th century: the people preserve legends. Men & women scything. A nightingale singing where we sat. Little frogs jumping into the stream.

Brufani. Three people watching the door open & shut. Commenting on visitors like fatesâ€”summing up, placing. A woman with a hard lined aquiline faceâ€”red lipsâ€”bird like, perfectly self-satisfied. French, pendulousâ€”a rather poor sister. Now they sit nibbling, at human nature. We are rescued by the excellence of our luggage.

Rome. tea. Tea in cafe. Ladies in bright coats & white hats. Music. Look out & see people like movies. Abyssinia. Children begging. CafÃ© haunters. Ices. Old man who haunts the Greco.

Sunday cafe. Nâ essa & Aâ ngelica drawing. Very cold. Rome a mitigated but perceptible Sunday. Fierce large jowld old ladies. Q. talking about Monaco. Talleyrand. Some very poor black wispy women. The effect of dowdiness produced by wispy hair. The Prime Ministers letter offering to recommend me for the Companion of honour. No.
