Yes, but these upper air scenes get too thin. Reflection after a morning of Kitty & Edward in Richmond. At first theyre such a relief though after the other that one gets blown & flies ahead. The thing is to take it quietly; go back; & rub out detail; too many â€˜pointsâ€™ made: too jerky, & as it were talking â€˜atâ€™. I want to keep the individual & the sense of things coming over & over again & yet changing. Thats whats so difficult: to combine the two.

Last night L. was woken at one, by a man shouting abuse of Woolf & Quack in German under his window. Ought we to tell the police? I think it was a drunken undergraduate.

After our dinner at Raymondâ€™s with Aldous & the subconscious hostility I always feel there, Iâ€™m facing the fact that my next book, Professions, The Next War, will need some courage. 2 million women all longing for men, Aldous said. Raymond insisted, with his little hard squeak, that men were now unfairly treated: have to maintain a woman wife. Went on to Albany. Party for the German theyve married to the postmanâ€”for Â£50. I talked to crazy Bob Nichols, & had my hand pressed by the rather sordid fat greyfaced intense Naomi, who wants to come & see us.
