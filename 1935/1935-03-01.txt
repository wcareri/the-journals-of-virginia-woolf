### Friday 1 March

First of March: first of spring. Another blue day; & weâ€™re off to Walton on Thames, so I must cut short my Danteâ€”dear me. Last nights partyâ€”Ann & Richard Ll. D.â€”that was to have been so dashing & easy, turned out rather a grind. Ann, poor dear, in her thick shoes:â€”hadnâ€™t troubled to change them, or to brush her hair, mumbled, & was shy (as I used to be, I suppose, at 19). Richard, who has never been to a public school, & therefore has no inversions & perversions, ran free as a line with a salmon on it. But, then in came Janet (the image of Madge) & a great fat shiny nosed blubber lipped man, her husband: & Saxon, shrivelled & salted. No: not an easy party. How parties differ! L. & I did our old owls with a vengeance. But we were all at the wrong angles: cousins, old friends, new;â€”no, it was not an easy evening. Janet told the story of her dismissal, because the Beit fellowship (?) decided that no woman can do research work. This led to a fruitful discussionâ€”fruitful for my book I meanâ€”of the jealousy of the medical male: vested interests; how its partly that they dislike competition; partly that they cling to the status quo. But I must go & lunch at 12.30 for our expedition.
