### Sunday 29 September

Yesterday I saw the kingfisher again on the river. It flies across & across, very near the surface: it has a bright orange chocolate under side. And it is a tropical bird, sitting weighted on the bank. I have also seen a stoatâ€”brown with a white tipped tail. Yesterday I went to Moggery Poke, back by the river. L. met me with Sarah, who wont walk with me. Her love increases. And I read the Lovers Melancholy & skimmed the top of the words; & want to go on reading things miles awayâ€”beautiful hard words, remote. Not Mrs Easdale, who is silly, egotistic, sloppy, & very conventional. I am shocked to find Rodmell patched on to those pages.
