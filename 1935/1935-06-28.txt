### Friday 28 June

But dinner with the Cecils last night was very good: free & spontaneous; they were all dressed for a party at the Herberts: Origo was there, whom I like. She is young, tremulous, nervousâ€”veryâ€”stammers a littleâ€”but honest eyed; very blue eyed. Have I already described her? How she came to tea. Anyhow, shes clean & picks her feet up. Talk spurted. (I hope I did not try to be brilliant?) Rachel very diaphanous, simple, erratic, with Mollyâ€™s look, some of Desmondâ€™s humour. David growing domed & bald; his hair ruffled. We talked about: fear of people; parties; they were all afraid; Sitwellâ€™s lunch; Osbert such a nervous host; the gilt dolphin: rank; up in the drawing room, Origo (her name is Iris) sat down on purpose I think by me, & oh dear was it for this I got so free & easy?â€”she has read my books, & was of course full of stumbling enthusiasm; so I made a rush, & talked about writing, spilling out ideas, of a kind. She lives near Siena, in perfect country; they talk of the seasons; harvest; vintage; share with peasants; have a great vintage feast off goose. And we talked about: biography & fiction; but with David pricking up his ears across the room. So he had to be drawn in; & I think we have said the same things beforeâ€”about the relevant facts; biography as an art. Then the door opened & in came Leo Myers, like a du Maurier drawing; such a perfect white waistcoat, (I had not changedâ€”oh dear, when I have such nice clothes now) & his grizzled distinguished head. But he still looks like a sleepy viper. Well then we talked about novels; & could one write down thoughts for a whole day? He had done this & torn it up. He does not keep a notebook. What shall we do about our biographies? Can one report talk? Fear. He is always afraid. And Origo was silent for half an hour, because of going to the party. But she would lose her fear after the entry was over. Leo will be unhappy the next morning. Why does one do these things? Because this is life, after all. One has to. In the street David said that LM is in love with Iris. Thats why he had come. The sleepy viper in his white waistcoat.

L.â€™s book selling now; & he is cheerful, & very contrite, in his way, about Mabel. Here he comes in about the question of Ethel writing an introduction to Brewsterâ€™s book. And Vita writes that Gwen has to have a terrible operation. And Nessa does not write. And after thunder & heat & cold it is hot again; and in an access of generosity we have lent Monks House to Stephen Tennant, & thank God we are alone this week end.
