### Thursday 28 November

Another balk this morning: cant get the start off of the last chapter right. Whats wrong I dont know. But I neednâ€™t hurry. And the main thing is to let ideas blow, easily; & come softly pouring. And not to be too emphatic. Of course to step straight into the middle of a new character is difficult: North: & Iâ€™m a little exacerbated; meant to have a quiet week, & heres Nelly Câ ecil & Nan Hudson both asking to come; & will I ring up: & Nan has a Turkish friend. But I will not be rushed. No.
