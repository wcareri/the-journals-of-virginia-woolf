### Monday 10 September

A not so heavenly morning. Children staying here. Chill. L. in a stew about Stephen Tennantâ€”that is he wants to come: why have S. 3 times & not Kingsley Martin. A very old, sorry, but not serious story. And yet how foolish to have even these disagreements; & yet I suppose how inevitableâ€”magnets which draw other little straws along. Can I read, write or think though, going for a picnic, & the childrenâ€”nice lively undistinguished bratsâ€”shooting. Yet how quick & hard & unexpected childrens minds are. Everything within 10 miles seen exactly; their school; the maid whoâ€™s in love with the gardener; a solicitor not so good as a barrister: the rank of the girls fathers: the whole of society in one drop.
