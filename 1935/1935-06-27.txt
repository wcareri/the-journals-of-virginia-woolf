A good thing for old Bloomsbury to be shaken up no doubt: a good thing to dine with R. West & Mr Andrews last night in their flat in P. Sqre. with the view, with the Â£750 book case, & the fish carved out of a yew branch, & the modern pictures, period furniture letter box in the wall & which dont work (nor did Arnold Bennettâ€™sâ€”you have to poke with a stick). But the electric light in the coat cupboard does work. And whatâ€™s wrong? The plumbers noseâ€”the minerâ€™s canary, again. I mean scenting out differences, & let us hope inferiorities. Of course its admirable in its wayâ€”impersonal, breezy, yes, go ahead, facing life, eating dinner at Savoy, meeting millionaires, woman & man of the worldly; butâ€”no, I must add the kindness intelligence & erudition of the admirable effete spectacled swollen eyed Andrewsâ€”the cultivated don turned banker, with his devotion to R.â€”Cecily he calls her, for whom he buys these fish & bookcases. Whats wrong then? Where does the gas escape? I think its the emptiness, the formality, the social strata they live onâ€”appearances, as the Apostles would say: the sense of Now weâ€™re having a dinner party & must talk till 11: tomorrow another. Hospitality to American publisher & the Woolves. Nothing said of any naturalness or spontaneity. Yet thats not quite so; that one cd. go on having dinner every night & never know each other better. No intimacy at the end of that Oxford Street. And I was a little diminished in my own esteemâ€”why? Because .. did they differentiate me from other people? No. Or Leonard? But then isnt this Bloomsbury conceitâ€”our d-d refinement? I went on the roof with Andrews & saw all Londonâ€”a magnificent metropolis so brushed lip, so ornate, so continental & cosmopolitan at night in that quarter: thereâ€™s Oxford Street, theres Hyde Park, thats the new Lyons block of flats. And the West End squares; & oblongs of white light, & yellow light the faces, the rouged faces of offices & steeples & cranes; all very impressive; very soigne, like Mr Ginsburgâ€™s little sharp face: so radiantâ€”& I so blown about, I supposeâ . Graham came, a little fuddled: had drunk too much I think; made heavy weather with R. She has great vitality: is a broad browed very vigorous, undistinguished woman: but a buffeter & battler: has taken the waves, I suppose; & can talk in any language: why then this sense of her being a lit up modern block, floodlit by electricity?
