### Thursday 19 December

Dinner last night: the Bruce Richmonds; the Maclagans; Leigh Ashton, & a sprinkling of elderly bachelors. Not a twinge of alarm in itâ€”only the horrid beforehand discomfortâ€”hair doingâ€”rose buyingâ€”& setting out in cold. And B.R. was the spryest & liveliest of the lot. L. Ashton swollen, plum pudding faced; & such silencesâ€”Elena almost stupid to extinctionâ€”unvisited by a single ideaâ€”sitting silent; rough faced; oh so commonplace & we all so elderly; & not a spark or a twinkle; a rather spare dinner; & at 11 everyone got up, & the car hadnâ€™t come. And it was for this I crossed London in evening dressâ€”this is society.
