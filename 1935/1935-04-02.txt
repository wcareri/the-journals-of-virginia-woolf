### Tuesday 2 April

But poor old Ann has not only passed, but won a minor scholarship: Judith was only indulging in chaff. We had Ann to dinner & took her to Bengal Lancers: but the virility & empire building bored her. She thinks for herself, or has the youthful point of view naturally that we acquired through satire. She was not satirical, merely boredâ€”a good sign, if she is representative.

And it was a very cold day: & I read, in this room; & was glad not to pace the streets. I have now Enid Bagnoldâ€™s rather (I suspect) meretricious & much applauded book to read, Whats wrong with it? My nose is sniffing already. A letter of warm gratitudeâ€”why?â€”from Vita: says I AM a good friend, & have never failed her. Some muddle I dont fathom altogether, but suspect Gwen & St. John between them have fuddled poor old V.â€™s not very well founded head. Rather a lesson, not to write angry letters.

And does Louie cheat? A bill for a chicken that we had at Christmas again throws doubt on her. We must have it out about the milk this week. Not a week I want altogether. Angelicaâ€™s concert on Thursday: a meeting at Rodmell. Leonardâ€™s jury again put off.
