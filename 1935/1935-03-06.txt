### Wednesday 6 March

It was great fun at Ethelâ€™s party last night, & I enjoyed myself enormously, & I was a success (yes, I think so) with old Tonks, & obliterated Holmes, & the Charles Morgans want to dine, & all thatâ€” The difficulty is to combine the two: here & there. If I did much of that I should soon lose my hold on words, I feel: yet, before dinner, I only wanted talk gaiety other people. But thats the difficulty: not to be rubbed smoothed, jerked out into their light random galef?]. Could one manage both, then one would be a writer. Or thats my feeling. And at the age of 53 I still struggle: & still, thank Heaven, feel the rush & the glory & the agony, & never get used to any of it. But I cant write this morning.

An easy shabby party though. Nessa & Duncan made to dine alone, as we were late: I promoted to the high table,â€”had my little compliment, which pleased me. What I liked was the affability & character of the old saw bones Tonks, for so I called him 30 years ago when he lunched at Gordon Square & was so severe on Nessaâ€™s pictures. Now he was all kindness: & distinguished; & appreciative, & regretting Bloomsbury & the distance between us & Chelsea. Talked of G.M. & Steerâ€”who was there in a clergymans collar: almost hidebound; entirely silent, like a log removed from the fire & stood on end. Prof. Brown slept in his chairmanâ€™s seat: Ethel sat by him, silent, muttering in her hoarse voice, with her gnarled dirty fingers, & her hair coming down; then Holmes; Nothing could have been less formidable. A great crowd, & the Morgans as I sayâ€”he a fattish man with little pig eyes sunk: the nice respectable earnest successful ashamed of being successful man I imagined. I thought he had heard how I flung The Fountain out of the window: at any rate was a little obsequious. Then his wife came upâ€”English dog eyed woman, brown candid simple. How they would love to dine alone, on a Friday, when Charles neednt go to a theatre. So I easily flood my empty room, if I wish. And then with the surly unhappy opinionative Adrian Daintrey in full evening dress to the CafÃ© Royal, which lacks the old romance; but I was glad to snatch a sight of it, & to wonder about life there, for a second. Not many artists, all flashy people who donâ€™t belong anywhere, Daintrey said. How I laughed at Nessa & Duncan made to dine alone, & let in with the dessert. It was Duncanâ€™s fault for being so late coming in. And he slept during the drone of Brownâ€™s 84 year old soliloquy: he couldnt pull up or go on. And Tonks in his airy blue eyed wayâ€”heâ€™s grown very transparentâ€”kept interrupting. And then Mrs MacColl, in her French accent called him to order. And the dinner was very bad.
