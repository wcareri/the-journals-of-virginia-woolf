### Sunday 29 December

I have in fact just put the last words to The Yearsâ€”rolling, rolling, though its only Sunday, & I allowed myself till Wednesday. And I am not in such a twitter as usual. But then I meant it to end calmlyâ€”a prose work. And is it good? That I cannot possibly tell. Does it hang together? does one part support another? Can I flatter myself that it composes; & is a whole? Well there still remains a great deal to do. I must still condense, & point; give pauses their effect, & repetitions, & the run on. It runs in this version to 797 pages: say 200 each (but thats liberal) it comes to roughly 157,000â€”shall we say 140,000. Yes, it needs sharpening, some bold cuts, & emphases. That will take me anotherâ€”I dont know how long. And I must subconsciously wean my mind from it finally & prepare another creative mood, or I shall sink into acute despair. How oddâ€”that this will all fade away & something else take its place. And by this time next year, I shall be sitting here, with a vast bundle of press cuttingsâ€”no: not in the flesh, I hope; but in my mind there will be the usual Chorus of what people have said about this mass of scribbled type writing, & I shall be saying, That was an attempt at that; & now I must do something different. And all the old, or new, problems will be in front of me. Anyhow the main feeling about this book is vitality, fruitfulness, energy. Never did I enjoy writing a book more, I think: only with the whole mind in action, not so intensely as The Waves.
