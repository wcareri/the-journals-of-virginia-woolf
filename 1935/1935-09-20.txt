### Friday 20 September

Yes it was a terrific storm; a storm to mark, I suppose. All the trees chocolate brown on the wind side; little leaves like chipped potatoes. We went to Seaford & saw the explosions of white water over the lighthouse. The cars were stopped by a policeman. Sea coming over the road. (I passed 5 minutes making up The Years, which is now going strong: only then we have Tom for the week end of course).

People were standing under the shelter of the Buckle Inn. I went creeping round while L. took a photograph, & saw the people standing in the upper window, looking out: very 18th century; the lower windows & cellars boarded up. Clive Angelica & Q. yesterday. Iâ€™m ashamed to say I had longed for this week to be all alone; reading; never had a quiet week all this summer, & the balm it would beâ€”& even a tea party means apprehension, breakage. Went to Lewes; bought a cake; left the car, tried walking home; fine but a great tearing wind; so stopped at Iford & took the bus. Poor old Clive a little battered I thought. A grey tuft. He has a curious antiquity, premature age, sometimes: I suppose when the top doesnâ€™t spin. He had been spinning round Greece with Dadie, Shepherd, aristocrats, schoolmasters; was impressed by the beauty; enjoyed himself vastly. Must have done his owl vociferously. Was very nice, Iâ€™ve no doubt, & had dined God knows with what Lallas & Hoffmans & the rich & the great at Venice. All determined on war. Clive is writing a letter to the N.S. against war. Warâ€™s so awful it cant be right anyhowâ€”an argument for which I like him: his genuine humanity. Dislike of being uncomfortable himself: yes; but he dislikes other peopleâ€™s unhappiness too. Says Muâ ssolini is madâ€”the Italians say so; but all the young are frothed up. Very cold. Sat over the fire. Two nights ago I started reading Roger. Thereâ€™s all the schoolboy letters to begin on: whether its wise, I dont know. But I think I canâ€”the boys are in the churchyard, & want to climb over & get our chestnuts, but see meâ€”mass my day all together.
