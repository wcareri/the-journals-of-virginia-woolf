### Saturday 14 December

Dinner last night with the Huxleys: not altogether a sparkler. Julian & his wife, whom I did not recognise, but later understood from his eyebrows &c who he was. A very chirpy I dont know why I think him dull, man. Full of scraps of information; & the same quickness that Aldous hasâ€”the same vivacityâ€”but less sympathetic. And I guess that they sparâ€”Julian & Juliette. She would have her sayâ€”about politics: he breasted her. But Maria & I talked after dinner, about Lotte Wolfâ€”did I say Iâ€™d spent 2 hours over their Dutch writing table under the black lamp being analysed? That was the evening Morgan rang up & said he had to have an operation: & I was very gloomy, in my funeral way, going to Piccadilly in the bitter cold, & walking down Regent St. by mistake. Then Morgan dined with us, & had a little private talk with L. I think he feels he may die. Naturally. Aldous has a man in Switzerland however who does the operation from behind, & its over, & the patient cured in a day. Aldous in great flow: enjoys London; is getting on well with his novel; & thus juicy, sympathetic. He has a sense of the suffering, as well as of the infamy of the world. Had been getting Bryan Guiness to subscribe towards the Prince; who sits 2 doors off us, starving under his purple robes. Cheeks sunk; pouting starving Aldous said, in a room of the flat of some people who teach Russian. And he led us down the long gallery to the cab.
