### Thursday 9 May

Sitting in the sun outside the German Customs. A car with the swastika on the back window has just passed through the barrier into Germany. L. is in the customs. I am nibbling at Aaronâ€™s Rod, Ought I to go in & see what is happening? A fine dry windy morning. The Dutch Customs took 10 seconds. This has taken 10 minutes already. The windows are barred. Here they came out & the grim man laughed at Mitz. But L. said that when a peasant came in & stood with his hat on, the man said This office is like a Church & made him move it. Heil Hitler said the little thin boy opening his bag, perhaps with an apple in it, at the barrier. We become obsequiousâ€”delighted that is when the officers smile at Mitziâ€”the first stoop in our back.

That a work of art means that one part gets strength from another part. At Ulken: home reached late after being turned aside to make way for the Minister President.

By the Rhine, sitting at the window, looking out on the river. The waiter has been talking. He has been in America: democratic; talks as if he were host. Like a little supple monkey. â€œLet me see now, you like good coffee. What have we nice?â€ & so on. Also the managerâ€”was in the City Roadâ€”wanted to go back & keep a German hostel in Bedford Place. We were chased across the river by Hitler (or Goering) had to pass through ranks of children with red flags. They cheered Mitzi. I raised my hand; People gathering in the sunshineâ€”rather forced like school sports. Banners stretched across the street â€œThe Jew is our enemyâ€ â€œThere is no place for Jews inâ€”â€. So we whizzed along until we got out of range of the docile hysterical crowd. Our obsequiousness gradually turning to anger. Nerves rather frayed. A sense of stupid mass feeling masked by good temper. So we came here, Unkel, an old country house, with curved bannister, shallow steps, a black grated stair door, & courtyard. A number of little eyes in the roof, rabbits & doves in outhouses. The innkeeper is playing cards with his wife. They all want to go awayâ€”back to Islington, back to Washingtonâ€”Oh so lovely, said the waiter, who wants to go on talking.
