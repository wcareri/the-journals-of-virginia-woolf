Innsbruck

L. says I may now tell the truth, but I have forgotten 2 days of truth, & my pen is weeping ink. Let me see. We went on from the old country house Inn, which ran their charges up high, & drove down the Rhine, & tried to see it as an engaged couple in 1840â€”no good. An ugly pretentious countryâ€”operatic scenery. High, but insignificant hills, bristling with black & green fir trees, with correct towers & ruinsâ€”a river that runs with coal barges like Oxford Street; traffic on the cobbled roads: & then a wall had fallen, & we were made to cross over to the right side again. And so toâ€”to where? I begin to forget. The dullest day of them all. But we got to Augsburg; & we had a room with a bath, & then went on, to Heidelberg, which isâ€”yesâ€”a very distinguished University town, on the Neckar. The dons & their daughters were having a musical evening. I saw them tripping out to each others houses with pale blue Beethoven quartets under their arms. Something like the Verralls & the Darwins in old Cambridgeâ€”the same dress, & nice intelligent faces. Great rhododendrons blooming. Still hot & blue. And the river like sliding plate glass: And next day to Augsburgâ€”a dull town, but with a bath. A room with a bath. The country steadily improvesâ€”becomes shaped & spaced. From Augsburg to Innsbruck where I sit in the empty roomâ€”the hotels quite empty, & the town quiet as the grave, & very stately. What did we see today? Great snow hills, with black rifts in them. Torrents. Lakes; one copper green. And it rained for the first time & was cold in the mountains. Fancy living with dirty snow at the door in May! Lovely, but utilitarian, pine woods. Black troops herded together. The Hitler feeling relaxed, though every village had a painted sign â€œDie Juden sind hier unwunschtâ€. But this seemed to be put up by authority. Changed into Austria at last; & we are now almost out of earshot.
