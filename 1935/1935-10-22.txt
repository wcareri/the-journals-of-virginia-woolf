### Tuesday 22 October

I am again held up in The Years by my accursed love of talk. That is to say, if I talk, to Rose Macaulay from 4. to 6.30: to Elizabeth Bowen from 8 to 12 I have a dull heavy hot mop inside my brain next day & am a prey to every flea, ant gnat (as for example that I let P. Quennel misrepresent me & never answered him). So I have shut the bookâ€”Sal & Martin in Hyde Parkâ€”& spent the morning typing out Rogerâ€™s memoirs. This is a most admirable sedative & refresher. I wish I always had it at hand. Two days rest of that nerve is my prescription; but rest is hard to come by. I think I shall refuse all invitations to chatter parties till Iâ€™m done. Could it only be by Christmas! For instance, if I go to Edith Sitwellâ€™s Cocktail this evening I shall only pick up some exacerbating picture: I shall froth myself into sparklets; & thereâ€™ll be the whole smoothing & freshening to begin again. But after The Years is done then I shall go everywhere: & expose every cranny to the light. As it is, who doesnâ€™t come here? Every day this week I must talk. But in my own room Iâ€™m happier, I think. So I will now plod quietly through the Bridges letters, & perhaps begin to arrange all Helenâ€™s tangled mass.
