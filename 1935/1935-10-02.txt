### Wednesday 2 October

Yesterday we went to the Lâ abour Party meeting at Brighton, & of course, though I have refused to go again this morning, I am so thrown out of my stride that I cant hitch on to The Years again. Why? The immersion in all that energy & all that striving for something that is quite oblivious of me; making me feel that I am oblivious of it. No, thats not got it. It was very dramatic: Bevinâ€™s attack on Lansbury. Tears came to my eyes as Lâ ansbury spoke. And yet he was posing I feltâ€”acting, unconsciously, the battered Christian man. Then Bevin too acted I suppose. He sank his head in his vast shoulders till he looked like a tortoise. Told L. not to go hawking his conscience round. And what is my duty as a human being? The women delegates were very thin voiced & insubstantial. On Monday one said, It is time we gave up washing up. A thin frail protest, but genuine. A little reed piping, but what chance against all this weight of roast beef & beerâ€”which she must cook? All very vivid & interesting; but over lapping: too much rhetoric, & what a partial view: altering the structure of society: yes, but when its altered? Do I trust Bevin to produce a good world, when he has his equal rights? Had he been born a dukeâ€”My sympathies were with Salter who preached non-resistance. Heâ€™s quite right. That should be our view. But then if society is in its present state? Happily, uneducated & voteless, I am not responsible for the state of society. These are some of the minnows that go round my head, & distract me from what is, after all, my work. A good thing to have a day of disturbanceâ€”2 days evenâ€”but not 3. So I didnt go; & cant really write. However I will make myself when Iâ€™ve done this. Odd the enormous susceptibility of my mind to surface impressions: how I suck them in & let them swirl about. And how far does anybodies single mind or work matter? Ought we all to be engaged in altering the structure of society? Louie said this morning she had quite enjoyed doing for us, was sorry we were going. Thats a piece of work too in its way. And yet I cant deny my love of fashioning sentences. And yet â€¦ L. has gone there, & I daresay Iâ€™ll discuss it with him. He says politics ought to be separate from art. We walked out in the cold over the marsh, & discussed this. The fact is too my head easily tires. Yes, too tired to write. But a good thing to be too tired for that reason, minnows swirling, now & then. I will do some Roger.
