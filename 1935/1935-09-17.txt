### Tuesday 17 September

So they came: I mean all the Bells, & Janie, growing a little elderly & showing her grandfather the shoemaker, but very gayly dressed; a coloured comforter round her neck; a chic little knitted cap, & a black coat with silver buttons. Quentin like a large red & white sheepdog. Eve very pretty; mouse like with her pointed twitching nose. When I woke her early next morning she looked just like a white sleeping mouse. Angelica suddenly depressed. I think I did not get enough glow into the dinner, & she thought why did I want to come?

London yesterday: a violent storm of wind all night. Garden a litter of apples & branches. Percy busy staking up trees.
