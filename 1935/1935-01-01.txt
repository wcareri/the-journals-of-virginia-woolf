### Tuesday 1 January

We went to Charleston. Nessa explained to us that Clive had made a scene the night before about bringing six friends to the party. Wouldnt come, unless he could bring 6 friends without naming them. Now why? I suppose something rankling about our not liking Raymond & so on. Final grumbles to be heard at dinner; as if he were anxious to explain. The play rather tosh; but Iâ€™m not going to bother about making a good impression as a play wright. And I had a lovely old years walk yesterday round the rat farm valley, by a new way, & met Mr Freeth, & talked about road making; & then in to Lewes to take the car to Martins, & then home, & read St Paul & the papers. I must buy the Old Testament. I am reading the Acts of the Apostles. At last I am illuminating that dark spot in my reading. What happened in Rome? And there are seven volumes of Renan. Lytton calls him â€˜mellifluousâ€™. Yeats & Aldous agreed, the other day, that their great aim in writing is to avoid the â€˜literaryâ€™. Aldous said how extraordinary the â€˜literaryâ€™ fetish had been among the Victorians. Yeats said that he wanted only to use the words that real people say. That his change had come through writing plays. And I said, rashly, that all the same his meaning was very difficult. And what is â€˜the literaryâ€™? Thats rather an interesting question. Might go into that, if I ever write my critical book. But now I want to write On being despised. My mind will go on pumping up ideas for that. And I must finish Ordinary People: & then thereâ€™s Roger. If I could finish O.P. in July: I would spend August in reading Roger, & writing Despised. Begin Roger in October 1935. Is that possible? Publish O.P. in Oct: & work at those two during 1936. Lord knows! But I must press a good deal of work inâ€”remembering 53â€”54â€”55 are on me. And how excited I get over my ideas! And thereâ€™s people to seeâ€”
