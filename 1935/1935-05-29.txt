### Wednesday 29 May

And I begin this sentence on a grey noisy evening might be mid September in Chartres, determined to let a long slide of time pass before I go motoring again. The pane of glass that is pressed firm over the mind in these travelsâ€”there I am vitreated on my seatâ€”cant read talk or writeâ€”only look I at the endless avenuesâ€”plane trees poplarsâ€”rain, rainâ€”old man with a cartâ€”ask the mileageâ€”look at map light a cigarette & turn over the old problemsâ€”chiefly the same, because I cant start a new one till the cage doors are openedâ€”all this makes the 2 last days as intolerable as the first two are rapturous.

And then it always rains; coming over the high Chartres plain it was almost a fog. At Orleans it was grey as November. Only the thought of getting quiet in ones own chair again makes this racketâ€”I write in the window looking on to a vast bare spaceâ€”tolerable. But its odd how one longs to uncurl the spring in the brainâ€”to let fly: how insipid life is withoutâ€”writing is it? Yet this is the best & least distressing of all our tours. I could only have wished 2 days less coming across France.

Its the depression too of the waiters & women behind glass in the hall; But I shall enjoy my dinner. And only one day moreâ€”Itâ€™ll take a day or two however to scratch off the pane of glass.

And, putting down my pen, I fetched L. & we went to the Cathedral which was almost dark & melodramaticâ€”I mean surprising, there only the arches & shadows showing, we all alone, & the blue windows blazing in the cold grey night. In fact it was like seeing the skeleton & eyes of the cathedral glowing there. Mere bones, & the blue red eyes. The windows are all blue & red, & at one end thereâ€™s the jewel burningâ€”the great rose jewel, burning blue in coal blackness, for all the world like something worn upon a vastâ€”what? womanâ 's body wont do. The jewel of the world thenâ€”or is that sentimental? After we had sat & looked slowly grayness returned to the thick pillars but still the scooped shadowy look remained. Never had we seen it so bare, so architectural, a statement of proportions, save for the fiery & deep blue glass, for the glass varied from gloomy to transcendent. So back to a first rate dinnerâ€”a dinner thought out, & presided over by a graceful young chef, precisely like Raymond, only with greater gift & charm. For instance he concocted a sauce out of cream, French beans, mustard, salt & wine. To add the wine he held his finger which was not clean half over the mouth of the bottle. Then left the sauce to simmer over a spirit lamp: then another red brown casserole was brought, & the sauce poured over. Our dinner was rich & thoughtful: I had mushrooms in cream. And I observed the way a good waiter serves a dish with infinite care & respect, as if handling something precious. Now Chartres is quieter, & so to sleep.
