### Monday 18 November

Our election week end was not a wise move, personally. I was silly though. Why go to Patcham in pouring rain? Even if I didnâ€™t stay in London & hear Ethelâ€™s case, as I wished, it was foolish to have hours trapesing in the violent wind & wet to Rodmell. A wild grey white sea, & so many stops all the time, as we passed it, to take up the workmen who are building at Peacehaven. So a headache next day; & this morning a throat. I am held up & damped down. We missed Quentin & Nessa last night, from headache; and have to dine with Raymond & go to Aldous party tonight.

It struck me thoâ€™ that I have now reached a further stage in my writers advance. I see that there are 4? dimensions; all to be produced; in human life; & that leads to a far richer grouping & proportion: I mean: I: & the not I: & the outer & the innerâ€”no Iâ€™m too tired to say: but I see it: & this will affect my book on Roger. Very exciting: to grope on like this. New combinations in psychology & bodyâ€”father like painting. This will be the next novel, after The Years.
