### Tuesday 9 April

I met Morgan in the London Library yesterday & flew into a passion.

â€œVirginia, my dearâ€ he said. I was pleased by that little affectionate familiar tag.  
â€œBeing a good boy & getting books on Bloomsbury?â€ I said.  
â€œYes. You listen. Is my book down?â€ he asked Mr Mannering.  
â€œWe were just posting itâ€ said Mr M.  
â€œAnd Virginia, you know Iâ€™m on the Coâ mmiâ ttee hereâ€ said Morgan. â€œAnd weâ€™ve been discussing whether to allow ladiesâ€”

It came over me that they were going to put me on: & I was then to refuse: Oh but they doâ€”I said. There was Mrs Green â€¦

â€œYes yesâ€”there was Mrs Green. And Sir Leslie Stephen said, never again. She was so troublesome. And I said, havent ladies improved? But they were all quite determined. No no no, ladies are quite impossible. They wouldnt hear of it.â€

See how my hand trembles. I was so angry (also very tired) standing. And I saw the whole slate smeared. I thought how perhaps M. had mentioned my name, & they had said no no no: ladies are impossible. And so I quieted down & said nothing & this morning in my bath I made up a phrase in my book on Being Despised which is to runâ€”a friend of mine, who was offeredâ€¦.. one of those prizesâ€”for her sake the great exception was to be madeâ€”who was in short to be given an honourâ€”I forget whatâ€”.. She said, And they actually thought I would take it. They were, on my honour, surprised, even at my very modified & humble rejection. You didnt tell them what you thought of them for daring to suggest that you should rub your nose in that pail of offal? I remarked. Not for a hundred years, she observed. And I will bring in M. Pattison: & I will say sympathy uses the same force required to lay 700 bricks. And I will show how you cant sit on Ctees if you also pour out teaâ€”that by the way Sir L.S. spent his evenings with widow Green; yes, these flares up are very good for my book: for they simmer & become transparent: & I see how I can transmute them into beautiful clear reasonable ironical prose. God damn Morgan for thinking Iâ€™d have taken that â€¦ And dear old Morgan comes to tea today, & then sits with Bessy Trevelyan whoâ€™s had cataract.

The veil of the templeâ€”which, whether university or cathedral, was academic or ecclesiastical I forgetâ€”was to be raised, & as an exception she was to be allowed to enter in. But what about my civilisation? For 2,000 years we have done things without being paid for doing them. You cant bribe me now.

Pail of offal? No; I said I was a while very deeply appreciating the honâ€¦. In short one must tell lies, & apply every emollient in our power to the swollen ~~& inflamed~~ skin of our brothers so terribly inflamed vanity. Truth is only to be spoken by those women whose fathers were pork butchers & left them a share in the pig factory.
