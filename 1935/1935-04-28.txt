### Sunday 28 April

Very cold again. Trees dotted with green in the park yesterday. Chestnuts just beginning to flower. A black sky & the paper festoons looking purple & pink across the streets: large blue paper crowns & roses being delivered. Julian & Alix to dine, James having a cold. Conversation: whether one can give people a substitute for war. Must have the danger emotion: must climb mountains, fight bulls; but this emotion mixed, I say, with philosophy, doesnt last more than a few months in case of war. J. says all the young men are communists in order to gratify their desire to do things together & in order to have some danger; which will only last a few months. The Germans being very poor, think anything is better than this. But this was not the 1914 emotion. Lust & danger. Cant cut them out at once. Must divert them on to some harmless object. But what? Some fantasy must be provided. I say many people have found life exciting without war and bull fighting. Has war ever won any cause? Alix says our civil war. I made up some of my Professions book. Obviously, Julianâ€™s quite unaware of some of his own motives, at the same time very lively & energetic. Alix like a blackshirt, all brown & tie & tailor made. No talk of Lytton: all argument; but interesting. What is the use of trying to preach when human nature is so crippled?
