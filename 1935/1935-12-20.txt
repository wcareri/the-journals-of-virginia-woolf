â€œIts because one changes oneâ€™s valuesâ€ Nessa said last night, when we discussed why we cdnt paint or write after a dinner party. And thats true. Only artists know how to live. She cant paint after a party. Cant get back into those proportionsâ€”Worse for women, because they have to be more active at parties: have to throw themselves into it. She wont go anywhere now where they make her dress. The best thing about our notoriety such as it is is that we can see anyone we want here on our own terms. The bell went on ringing. Tut. Popkin. Clive & Benitaâ€”all by appointment to sign some documents in Duncanâ€™s room. And as he had stuck up a notice saying Out, Flossie had to come constantly to say Mr Popkins says heâ€™s out. Tell Popkins to go in. Then Helenâ€”And I was not glad to see her, wh. she feltâ€”(to my disgrace) & after one cup went. And Nessa had chosen a nice rug. And had had her London Group meeting there. And this must be the last entry in this book because we are just about to go to Rodmell for Christmas.
