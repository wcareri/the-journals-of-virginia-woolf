### Sunday 6 January

Francis died on 2nd. It was a mercy, as we say, that it ended so soon. But a queer thing death. Last night I suddenly thought, how silly & indeed disgusting death, the decomposition of the body, &c. Why think of it as anything noble?

We lunched with Maynard & Lydia. The first fine cold day since we came. Talk rather sterile at first. Servant in the room. I suddenly scaled Lydiaâ€™s depths; & desire to have it recognised. We were talking about Somerset Maugham. She â€œI said to him, do you write in the morning or the evening? And he said â€œThis is not the time to discuss things like thatâ€ he thought me so naiv: he thought I was nothing more.â€ â€œBut when I write your life I will bring in the other Lydiaâ€ I said. Oh Virginia do! she exclaimed. Mâ . talked about the books he bought at the Gibbon sale. Geoffrey bought an Herodotus full of G.â€™s notes. Geoffreyâ€™s library is the best investment he ever made. After lunch we got through the formal artificial. We talked about Francis: M. said he was a case of arrested development; had been a most brilliant undergraduate, & remained one. Should have his brain analysed. Then Wellsâ€”had read his Auâ tobiographâ y. Thought him a little squit. Ah Maynard, you could not put that word in print. A lack of decency, said M. Shaw feels it. Shaw wd. never write of anyone he respected as he wrote of Wells. Then he read us a long magnificently spry & juicy letter from Shaw, on a sickbed, aged 77. The whole of economics twiddled round on his finger, with the usual dives & gibes & colloquialities. The most artificial of all styles, I said, like his seeming natural speaking. M.'s own letter said that he thinks he has revolutionised economics; in the new book he is writing. â€œWait ten years, & let it absorb the politics & the psychology & so on that will accrue to it; & then youâ€™ll seeâ€”the old Ricardo system will be exposed; & the whole thing set on a new footing.â€ This he wrote in so many words: a gigantic boast; true I daresay. That was why we were asked to lunch not teaâ€”that he may write his book in the soft exciting hours. â€œHe potsâ€ said Lydia when we got up to go. He was potting this morning. â€œAll the weeklies are mere homes for inferiority complexesâ€ he said. Nobody has any dignity or nobility as a critic. Except Chesterton, struck in Lydia. What we want is impersonality, I said. And we discussed Joadâ€™s dismissal of Bloomsbury. So to our car, they hanging arm in arm. And to Lewes to get the gaiters Iâ€™m so proud of. And a teasing letter (the other night) from Eâ lizabeth Bibesco.

â€œI am afraid that it had not occurred to me that in matters of ultimate importance even feminists cd. wish to segregate & label the sexes. It wd. seem to be a pity that sex alone should be able to bring them togetherâ€â€”

to which I replied, What about Hitler? This is because, when she asked me to join the Cttee of the anti-Fascist Exn., I asked why the woman question was ignored. So we go on, sparring & biting. I shouldnâ€™t mind giving that woman a toss in the air
