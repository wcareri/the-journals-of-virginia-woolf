### Thursday 12 September

Mornings which are neither quiet nor heavenly, but mixed of hell & ecstasy: never have I had such a hot balloon in my head as re-writing The Years; because its so long; & the pressure is so terrific. But I will use all my art to keep my head sane. I will stop writing at 11.30 & read Italian or Dryden and so dandle myself along.

To Ethel at Miss Hudsonâ€™s yesterday. As I sat in the complete English Gentlemanâ€™s home, I wondered how anybody could tolerate that equipage; & thought how a house should be portable like a snail shell. In future perhaps people will flirt out houses like little fans; & go on. Thereâ€™ll be no settled life within walls. There were endless clean, well repaired rooms. A maid in a cap. Cakes on pagoda trays. A terrible array of glossy brown furniture, & booksâ€”red sham leather. Many nice old rooms, but the manor house has been embellished & made of course selfconsciously elaborate. A ball room: a libraryâ€”empty. And Miss Hudson all brushed up with her Pekinese, a competent ex mayor of Eastbourne, with waved grey hair, & all so neat & stout, & the silver frames askew; & the air of order, respectability, commonplace. â€œIâ€™m going to call on the vicars wife.â€ Ethel immensely red & stout; churning out, poor old woman, the usual indefatigable egotism about deafness & her Mass. She must have a scene every six months. No. But of course, to be deaf, to be 76â€”well, back to Charleston with Eve & Angelica. And we called on the Wigrams & snubbed Stephen off.
