### Sunday 15 September

A terrific downpour. Never was such rain, I think, as this year. Autumn showing through. Autumn birds chirping through the rain. A queer book, Hopeâ€™s lifeâ€”so neat, discreet, & somehow dated. An Edwardian writer making Â£70,000 out of books in 10 years; very much in the world, like a du Maurier; yet sensitive, depressed: much left out I guess; only a decorous shell, sitting sucking a gold knobbed cane by the Row. But genuine in its well bred way.

I am thinking I will broach the three boxes of Roger; very staidly, merely beginning to drop a few facts into my brain. Indeed I must, as people want letters & so on. But I swear I will not let it buzz me into excitement. I will keep a space for my P.Â P. little book. Anthony Hope lived in dread of going sterile. I dont think I ever envisage that as a possibility. I always say on the contrary, Shall I ever have time enough to write out all thats in my head? A much happier state; though suppose whatâ€™s in my head becomes sillier & feebler? But why should it? Not if I vary it sufficiently: what with pamphlets, criticism, poetry, fiction, & as I think a play perhaps. But then Iâ€™m a very slow writer. He did his book yearly. And The Years (that name is fixed; dropped like a billiard ball into a pocket) will have taken me very nearly 3 yearsâ€”say I finish it by Christmas. And I never think, seriously, of dying.

Nessa & Duncan are to come to tea; Angelica & Eve to stay the night; then London, & L.â€™s labour party tomorrow. So the summer ends itself. A very hard working summer.

Margaret & Lilian in a pale yellow house, fitted as compactly as a ships cabinâ€”fires let into the wallâ€”baths turning into cupboards more or lessâ€”in a wood. Very nice tree opposite the sitting room, & spotted woodpeckers. The best view of that silly pretty Surrey country: M. in a cap; L. very blind. We had so much to say, they were so starved of talk, that in fact we said things of the utmost triviality. That was queer. And had to see over the house. A pile of dull 19th Century classics that Lâ ilian wants to sell. All spick & span: very blue & yellow. M.â€™s melodramatic bad taste surprising. We drove through Rusper & other small dignified Surrey towns lying shut in, airless, among hedges: merely country. Now to write letter after letter. But I cant cross the garden in this rain. Percy has to hide. Even the Church bells, I think, dont ring. A black bird digging in the grass. And the rooks cawing through the down rush; through the mist of rain.
