But it turned out very well last night: headache liftedâ€”we walked in Regents Park in the rain. Old Edith singularâ€”very, with her great bald faceâ€”its sweep of rather repulsive brownâ€”its shock of red hair. So beautiful in some lights; & the thin fan shaped hands & their gestures, timid, appealing, attached to this large fat clumsy body in its black rather sack like dress. She has great wit & some sharp edge of character. Quite decided. Knows her mind. She made us laugh all dinner, talking about W. Lewis, who used to paint her, letting her in, at a chink of the door. Who have you been seeing? Clive Bell? And he wore a patch over one eye; switched it on to another, as he disliked the light. She has a gay rambling butterfly mind; & a good deal of sting. & humanity. In came Ottoline; rather garish, & not so quick in the mind as the rest of us. Eddie a very good listener. Then Julian, with his poems, & Quentin. It was all demonstration on Edithâ€™s part, done for our amusement very difficult to recapture. And something drenched & feeble. She has to get up at 7 to write about Queen Victoria at the bidding of Dick le Mare, who is a magician. Something yielding about her, humble, & yet a lady of quality. â€œThe horrid middle class wayâ€ said Ott. Edith echoed her. Looks like a Plantagenet tomb said Ott. So she does, with her high nose, in the air, & her thin lips & her little peering eyesâ€”very medieval. Ottoline said you couldnt read Shâ akespeare in Indiaâ€”too remote.
