### Saturday 19 January

The play came off last night, with the result that I am dry-brained this morning, & can only use this book as a pillow. It was said, inevitably, to be a great success; & I enjoyedâ€”let me see what? Bunnyâ€™s praise; Oliverâ€™s; but not much Christabelâ€™s, or the standing about pumping up vivacities with David, Cory, Elizabeth Bowen: yet on the whole, it is good to have an unbuttoned laughing evening once in a way. Angelica ravishing of course, but of course too grown up for my taste. That is, I rather dread Bloomsbury; & rather relish the clumsy directness, the hard fact of the Stephen girls: so clumsy & large. But they will become workersâ€”in the cause ofâ€”how the phrases one has written & listened to so many times run in the head! And Bobo by the way, greyhaired, silver & rose, very handsome, exacerbated me by saying I was always publishing. Am I? But I carefully extracted that thorn & put it on the mantelpiece. And Morgan said it was lovely, I mean the play. In the middle, old Gumbo delivered a stout envelope, with a photograph of her mother. Old: Gumbo never went to America after all. And Rosamondâ€™s play is dubious, because Gielgud has made such a success with Hamlet. There is something pleasing in the misfortunes of ones friends: I wonder.

And there was Helen, & she said that Margery has all her spines erect again, about Roger: which makes me guess that she is doubtful about that biography. Rogerâ€™s ghost knocked at the doorâ€”his portrait of Charlie Sanger was delivered in the thick of the rehearsal. And How Francis would have enjoyed this, Leonard said. These are our ghosts now. But they would applaud the attempt. So to sleep: & now, God bless my soul, as Tenn: would say, I must rinse & freshen my mind, & make it work soberly on something hard: theres my Dante; & Renan. And the horrid winter lap begins; the pale unbecoming days, like an aging woman seen at 10 oâ€™clock. However, L. & I shall go for a walk this afternoon; & that seems to me an enormous balance at the Bank: solid happiness.

I have an idea for a â€˜playâ€™ Summers night. Someone on a seat. And voices speaking from the flowers.
