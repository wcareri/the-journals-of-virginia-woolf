### Wednesday 17 April

So the move, anyhow the Bell move, which heralds the flock, has begun: Angelica rushed in here at 1 yesterday with patterns for my clothesâ€”such is her passionâ€”and left her cap behind, & todayâ€”a fine day so farâ€”theyâ€™re off. Tomorrow we go to Rodmell, & when Brace, at 7, shut the doorâ€”no, I stood in the doorâ€”but slowly put on his coat, & made some very polite remark about seeing us in New Yorkâ€”when all this happened, I sank back & thought the holiday has begun. For I had been trying on a dress at Murrayâ€™s, in the bitter cold wind. I counted 20 between one of Braceâ€™s words & the next; he has grown toad faced, but is all the same a decent long suffering man. Things looking up in America, so he said.

I forgetâ€”I had something in mind to write here, about â€˜the soulâ€™ perhaps. Iâ€™m jaded again, & canâ€™t go on rewriting. The book is to be sent to America in October: may be serialisedâ€”if so wonâ€™t be out for a year. But I have still Â£990. Something about Spenderâ€™s book had I in mind? To jot down a few notes on it. No. about the soul. Breaking moulds. Coming out with views. A French article calls me the Fairy of Eng. lit. Odd how this fairy works then.

The Wigrams a little defensive about Jews in Germany: want to come over & see usâ€”Susie Buchan asks us to stay. Now these painful visits are in fact the real breaking up of the soul: such a labour. And L. gets more & more addicted to solitude & astuteâ€”the old wretchâ€”at finding good reasons for it. But then his hand trembles; mine doesntâ€”could I overcome the clothes fear. The soulâ€”the soulâ€”How far could I let myself go in an anti fascist pamphlet? I think of dashing off my professions for women, can I steal a moment between Roger Lytton & proofs. All this about being so distinguished & cultivated might be knocked on the head. In Eâ lviraâ€™s soliloquy I think I have tapped a new method of argumentâ€”very short & compact: but then this is spun out with description. The sun blazes: my skylight blue; no white tufted. Iâ€™m reading, or going to read, Alfieri, Chateaubriand, Paxton, Leo Myers; Barker & Moore poetry; so Easter will flyâ€”oh to be alone with our fine York ham. No, Iâ€™ve forgotten the soul.
