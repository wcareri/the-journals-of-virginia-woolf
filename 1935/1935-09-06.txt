### Friday 6 September

I am going to wrap my brain in green dock leaves for a few days: 5, if I can hold out; till the children, L.â€™s nieces, have gone. If I canâ€”for I think a scene is forming. Why not make an easier transition: Maggie looking at the Serpentine say; & so avoid that abrupt spring? Isnâ€™t it odd that this was the scene I had almost a fit to prevent myself writing? This will be the most exciting thing I ever wrote, I kept saying. And now its the stumbling block. I wonder why? too personal, is that it? Out of key? But I wont think. A flutter & clutter of engagements: Nessa; Stephen, Ethel, then the children; & L., as I know, is very touchy, dear love, about his family: an inferiority complex, I call it, thinking how much more vigorous & interesting my relations are: missing Julian; yes. Still whats odd is how nice people are: children always. So thereâ€™s no great harm done if I have to give up 48 hours.

Hugh, like Pipsy about the nose & eyes, Angâ elâ ica & Eve & Q. to tea yesterday. Bowls & archery. Into Lewes, shopping, which I dislike. Got Mrs Thompsett to come: Sandy clear skinned; was distempering kitchen, bright green; rather a good colour. I must get Rosie to make my curtains. Reading. Miss Mole: fair, but soft; & Stella Benson but Iâ€™m hard on novels, & an old dr. called Salter, & Dryden, & Alfieri. How soon one gets the hang of a written language! My gift I thinkâ€”the shape of the sentence. Violent wind & rain; violent sun & light; & they go on talking, threatening, advancing & retreating at Geneva. Look how clear my hand is when I donâ€™t write fiction of a morning. Head cool now at 1 instead of parboiled.
