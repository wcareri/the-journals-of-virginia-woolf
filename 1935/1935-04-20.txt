### Saturday 20 April

The scene has now changed to Rodmell, & I am writing at the table L. made (supported on a cushion,) & it is raining. Good Friday, was a complete fraudâ€”rain & more rain. I tried walking along the bank, & saw a mole, running on the meadowâ€”it glides fatherâ€”is like an elongated guinea pig. Pinka went & nuzzled it, & then it managed to slide into a hole. At the same time through the rain I heard the cuckooâ€™s song. Then I came home & read & readâ€”Stephen Spender; too quick to stop to think; shall I stop to think; read it again? It has considerable swing & fluency; & some general ideas; but peters out in the usual litter of an undergraduates table. Wants to get everything in & report and answer all the chatter. But I want to investigate certain questions: why do I always fight shy of my contemporaries? What is really the womanâ€™s angle? Why does so much of this seem to me in the air? But I recognise my own limitations: not a good ratiocinator, Lytton used to say. Do I instinctively keep my mind from analysing, which would impede its creativeness? I think thereâ€™s something in that. No creative writer can swallow another contemporary. The reception of living work is too coarse & partial if youre doing the same thing yourself. But I admire Stephen for trying to grapple with these problems. Only of course he has to hitch them roundâ€”to use his own predicament as a magnet, & thus the pattern is too arbitrary; if youâ€™re not in his predicament. But as I say, I read it at a gulp without screwing my wits tight to the argument. This is a method I find very profitable: then go back & screw.

In the public world, there are emphatic scares. L. brings home a bunch after every Cttee meeting. Its odd how seldom I report them. One of these days they may come true. For instance, Toller says we are on the brink of war. Wants the allies to declare war on Hitler. Belgium keeps its aeroplanes at active service level, all ready to rise into the air. But as Germany could be on them before they rose this seems useless. There is a dutiful perfunctory stir about the Jubilee. We have subscribed Â£3 towards buns & a bus shelter in Rodmell. It is a good excuse for buying what one wants. Piccadilly is marked with Venetian masts. Seats line all the main streets. The King is said to be almost comatose. Will he get through with his bowings? C. Morgan said he cant bend any longer. Andâ€”there are incessant conversationsâ€”Mussolini, Hitler, Macdonald. All these people incessantly arriving at Croydon, arriving at Berlin, Moscow, Rome; & flying off againâ€”while Stephen & I think how to improve the world.
