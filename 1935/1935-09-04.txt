### Wednesday 4 September

The most critical day since Aug 4th 1914. So the papers say. In London yesterday. Writings chalked up all over the walls. â€œDont fight for foreigners. Briton should mind her own business.â€ Then a circle with a symbol in it. Fascist propaganda, L. said. Mosley again active. The Queen of Bâ€™s funeral. Flags at half mast. Bought an umbrella for 25/-. The first good umbrella Iâ€™ve had for years. Man on the bus saw it was new, with a tassel.

L. saw Miss Swinstead Smith, a very nervous, nice, odd shabby woman, youngish; her first book; Constables almost published it but cried off on commercial grounds. We are going to do it though. She lives at Sennen in a cottage rent Â£12 a year. I went to Lâ r. Sqre & bought silk for nightgown. Mabel at the flat, very competent. Hot, windy. Home to grouse early. Now pouring. Letter from Denny, a silly gushing letter, has a son. Nature. She writes worse than she talks. Perhaps its writing to me. And Queenie Leavis also writes, a priggish letter, drawing attention to Life as we have known it, in that prigs manual, Scrutiny. All they can do is to schoolmaster.

Oh how it pours! I used my umbrella for the first time to cross the garden. Cant write today. I suppose after yesterday. Nessa in London. We saw a snake eating a toad: it had half the toad in, half out; gave a suck now & then. The toad slowly disappearing. L. poked its tail; the snake was sick of the crushed toad, & I dreamt of men committing suicide & cd. see the body shooting through the water.
