How terrified Iâ€™m getting of Ethelâ â€™s dressed dinner tomorrow! It makes a kind of ring round my mind. What Iâ€™m to wear: my velvet or chiffon: then my hair. When Iâ€™m there itâ€™ll be as easy as shelling peasâ€”why this apprehension? Wolff never touched on that by the way.

Sally Graves to tea: stayed till 7. A resolute cornered mind, defiant rather; balanced; pleased L.: sheâ€™s to write on Socialism. Told me Iâ€™m abused by the Gravesâ€™ in their new magazine; said the Mag was laughable. Said she was going to Paris; & I liked her; but not effusively. Too clever: too young. All in black. On the defensive. Now Bore Will to lunch. Shopped yesterday. I sit on a rubber cushion & can so type.
