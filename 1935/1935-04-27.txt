### Saturday 27 April

All desire to practise the art of a writer has completely left me. I cannot imagine what it would be like: that is, more accurately, I cannot curve my mind to the line of a book: no, nor of an article. Its not the writing but the architecting that strains. If I write this paragraph, then there is the next & then the next. But after a months holiday I shall be as tough & springy asâ€”say heather root; & the arches & the domes will spring into the air as firm as steel & light as cloudâ€”but all these words miss the mark.

Stephen Spender demands a letter of criticism; cant write it. Nor can I describe with any certainty Mrs Collett, with whom both L. & I fell in love yesterday. A whippet woman: steel blue eyes; silver spotted jersey; completely free, edged, outspoken, the widow of the Lord Mayorâ€™s son, who was killed before her eyes flying. After that she broke down, & the only cure she said was to go to Hong Kong & stay with Bella. From that we did not expect anything much, to tell the truth; whereas she ridiculed the Jubilee, the Lord Mayor & told us all about life in the Mansion House. The L.M. spends Â£20,000 out of his own pocket on his year of office; 10,000 on his sheriffdom; then buys an ermine coat for Â£1000 in which to admit the King to Temple Bar. It rains; the King flashes past, & the coat is spoilt. I dont like my father in law, she said; he doesnt do it at all well. Her mother in law is a perfectly natural sensible woman who goes buying fish with a bag. The Queen gave her as a token of esteem 2 huge shells, engraved with the story of George & the dragon. These mercifully are left at the Mâ ansion House. The L.M. wears a dress that is Heavy with bullion. A terrible state of display & uglinessâ€”but she was so nice & unexcited I actually asked her to come & see usâ€”which, had she known it, is a compliment we never never pay even: the royal family. But I cannot write even here; so shall read a story by Pirandello. James & Alix to dine to discuss Lyttonâ€™s life I suppose.
