### Monday 8 April

A week end of almost incessant conversation: first Mr Hancock on Wormwood Scrubs; then Maynard on the New Statesman. Both were full of interestâ€”but oh dear, how I grudge the silent evening reading gone! And it rains & rains. Came home in the rain, dined with Helen in the rain; went to Cliveâ€™s: rain pouring down when we drove Nessa back. All sat in Cliveâ€™s little room, as Angelica was in the big room. Talk of Dorothea & of the Statesman. Duncan snapping viciously at Kingsley. Duncan when heâ€™s angry snaps. Nessa is terrifically monolithic & imperiousâ€”a terrifying woman in her way. And I almost laughed myself sick over Dorothea. And it was slightly empty as usualâ€”but why? Without Roger, I suppose: & weâ€™re all so formal & going abroad for weeksâ€”Clive so unintimate nowadays. We must ask him to dinner in June.

And it is pelting on my skylight, & the rain has come through the roof, & I am rather jangled writing this restaurant chapter, & wish we could sit in the sun, & wish I were a more solid & capable woman; & yet manage to cut along. Hereâ€™s Boulestin asking us to lunchâ€”must I go? What an effort. Helen with her children rather ineffective but alive; the 2 gawks chattering easily
