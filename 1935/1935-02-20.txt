A row with Clive which spoilt my dinner at the Reads. Lor! the misery of human lifeâ€”our capacity for making ourselves miserable & stinging & biting like so many fleas. Not a very serious fleabite this one; only rouses my old inflammationâ€”I mean, after all those other little pismire affairs, I always get the sense of those unhappy days. He wrote one of his absurd pompous letters to Lord Ivor, as chairman of the F. Cttee: & quoted Virginia Woolf inviting me to â€œstrike a blow for freedomâ€. And so Wright rang up & Mr Blunt came round, & I had to explain, & then to write a letter, which brings the blood to my head, & takes time; & sent me parched & throbbing up to that vast comfortless studio, where none of the charm of Bohemia mitigated the hard chairs, the skimpy wine, & the very nice sensible conversation. Henry Moore, sculptor & his Russian wife, something like Cordelia Fisher in the old days to look at; but more sympathetic. Respectable Bâ ohemiâ a is a little cheerless. Better have Sybil or the real thing. But all went decorously. Steel chairs, clear pale colours; talk of pots; brainy talk, specialists talk. Read devitalised: possibly his lookâ€”a shop assistant. So this morning I cant write; only correct; & Hugh & Elth Bowen tonight, & tea with Nessa & Ethel Walker. Never mind.

Sara is the real difficulty: I cant get her into the main stream, yet she is essential. A very difficult problem; this transition business. And the burden of something that I wont call propaganda. I have a horror of the Aldous novel: that must be avoided. But ideas are sticky things: wont coalesce; hold up the creative, subconscious faculty: thats it I suppose. Ive written the chop house scene I dont know how many times.
