### Monday 11 March

How I should like, I thought, some time on the drive up this afternoon, to write a sentence again! How delightful to feel it form & curve under my fingers! Since Oct. 16th I have not written one new sentence, but only copied & typed. A typed sentence somehow differs; for one thing it is formed out of what is already there: it does not spring fresh from the mind. But this copying must go on, I see, till August. I am only now in the first war scene: with luck I shall get to Ea. in Oxford Street before we go in May: & spend June & July on the grand orchestral finale. Then in August I shall write again.

It was the bitterest Sunday for 22 years: we went down (there was a little skirmish between us, for when I saw the snow falling I said, what about putting it off? At this L. was I thought unduly annoyed; so that we wentâ€”but Lord what a quarrel most old married couples would: have made of it: & it turned to a candid joke before we were half angry). Then on Sunday we went to Sissinghurst: in the bitter wind with the country all lying in its June green & blue outside the window. Now thats an odd observation I have to make. My friendship with Vita is over. Not with a quarrel, not with a bang, but as ripe fruit falls. No I shant be coming to London before I go to Greece, she said. And then I got into the car. But her voice saying â€œVirginia?â€ outside the tower room was as enchanting as ever. Only then nothing happened. And she has grown very fat, very much the indolent county lady, run to seed, incurious now about books; has written no poetry; only kindles about dogs, flowers, & new buildings. Sâ issinghursâ t is to have a new wing; a new garden; a new wall; Well, its like cutting off a picture: there she hangs, in the fishmongers at Sevenoaks, all pink jersey & pearls; & thats an end of it. And there is no bitterness, & no disillusion, only a certain emptiness. In factâ€”if my hands werent so coldâ€”I could here analyse my state of mind these past 4 months, & account for the human emptiness by the defection of Vita; Rogerâ€™s death; & no-one springing up to take their place; & a certain general slackening of letters & fame, owing to my writing nothing; so that I have more time on my hands, & actually ask people to come here now & again. (But the week fills unbidden mostly). On the other hand, I have been less harassed; & have enjoyed reading again, more, I think than for 2 or 3 years past. I have read myself to a standstill in the F.Q.: & shall not press the mood till it returns naturally: I am reading Chateaubriand; & to my joy find I can read an Italian novel for pleasure, currently, easily. Yes, this is all very peaceful & profound, & I like it. But again I am harassed by the thought that Nessa will now take to abroad againâ€”sheâ€™s off in a week or two to Italy; &â€”what else? No, on the whole, save for a desire to break L. of his â€˜habitsâ€™, I am content to let things alone. I have been to a great many picture shows lately too: to the Nat Gall.; & thats a new picture which I should like to develop among my adumbrations. The truth is, ideas for other books are beginning to stir under the slab of The Pargiters.

Coming back in the snowstorm from Vitaâ€™s: the snow was like long ribbons of paper; whipping, mixing, getting entangled in front of the car.
