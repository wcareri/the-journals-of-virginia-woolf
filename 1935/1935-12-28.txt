Its all very well to write that date in a nice clear hand, because it begins this new book, but I cannot disguise the fact that Iâ€™m almost extinct; like a charwomans duster; that is my brain: what with the last revision of the last pages of The Years. And is it the last revision? And why should I lead the dance of the days with this tipsy little spin? But in fact I must stretch my cramped muscles: its only half past eleven on a damp grey morning, & I want a quiet occupation for an hour. That reminds meâ€”I must devise some let down for myself that wont be too sudden when the end is reached. An article on Gray I think. But how the whole prospect will take different proportions, once Iâ€™ve relaxed this effort. Shall I ever write a long book againâ€”a long novel that has to be held in the brain, at full stretchâ€”for close on 3 years? Nor do I even attempt to ask if its worth while. There are mornings so congested I cant even copy out Roger. Goldie depresses me unspeakably. Always alone on a mountain top asking himself how to live, theorising about life; never living. Roger always down in the succulent valleys, living. But what a thin whistle of hot air Goldie lets out through his front teeth. Always live in the whole, life in the one: always Shelley & Goethe, & then he loses his hot water bottle; & never notices a face, or a cat or a dog or a flower, except in the glow of the universal. This explains why his highminded books are unreadable. Yet he was so charming, intermittently.
