### Saturday 15 June

We dined with Clive, & I felt very fond of him. He has great sympathyâ€”as when, talking of Adrian, he said, â€œHe gets great pleasure now from his children. When I praised Annâ€™s looks, he bridled.â€ Yes, Iâ€™m very fond of my old Clive. And Li was charming, genial, affable, urbane. Clive said, I always say youre half cracked (to me). We were saying how many Rogers & Lyttons there are. He said Segonzac thinks Nessa the best painter in England, much better than Duncan. I will not be jealous, but isnt it oddâ€”thinking of gifts in her? I mean when she has everything else. And my head is congested again, & I will not go to Paris, because I should have a weeks misery; & for all my sweating, Iâ€™m getting ahead with the P.s; No name suggests itself. Rebecca asks me to dine. The Cecils ask us to dine.

And it is drumming with rain, & we are starting off to Philipâ€™s. This amused meâ€”L.â€™s complex. â€œHeâ€™s annoyed, thats why he hasnt written.â€ Finally, he got me to telephone last night, thinking it might be awkward if he bearded Philip who was annoyed. â€œVirginia? No. I never heard. But we should be delighted to see youâ€ said Philip cordially. So we are off, in this storm.

And Nessa never writes; but why make up stories about oneâ€™s relations? An odd family complex.
