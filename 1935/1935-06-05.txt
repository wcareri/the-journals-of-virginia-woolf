Back here again, & the grim wooden feeling that has made me think myself dead since we came back is softening slightly. Its beginning this cursed dry hard empty chapter again in part. Every time I say it will be the devil! but I never believe it. And then the usual depressions come. And I wish for death. But I am now seeing that the last 200 pages will assert themselves, & force me to write a play more or less: all broken up: & I stop to begin making up. Also, after the queer interlude, at once lifeâ€”that is the telephone beginningâ€”starts. So that one is forcibly chafed. (I meant to make a note about the dramatic shape which forces itself upon me). Vita; Stephen Tennant; Julian; dressmaker; going to Rodmell for Whitsun. Must I go to the Paris Conference? Amabel rings up.

Mrs Woolf yesterday talking admirable racy English. My head ached. The room bare, as sheâ€™s going to Worthing. She asked L. to read aloud Miss Daisy Knockends? letter, a daily maid whom Cecil might have marriedâ€”a decayed wastrel. â€œBut how can one give people up?â€ She had been to Philâ€™s show. â€œAnd old Queen was led about. I enjoyed it immensely.â€ There were lettuces & radishes for tea, but the people complained it was cold. Babs & Phil without an ounce of flesh on their faces. Such hard workâ€”A Gymkana. And Marie won a prize. And I often ask myself, what have I got out of life? I have brought up good men & womenâ€¦.
