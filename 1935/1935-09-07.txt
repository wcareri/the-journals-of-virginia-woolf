### Saturday 7 September

A heavenly quiet morning reading Alfieri by the open window & not smoking. I believe one could get back to the old rapture of reading if one did not write. The difficulty is, writing makes oneâ â€™s brain so hot it cant settle to read; & then when the heat goes, Iâ€™m so tired in the head, I can only skirmish. But Iâ€™ve stopped 2 days now The Years: & feel the power to settle calmly & firmly on books coming back at once. John Baileyâ€™s life, come today, makes me doubt thoughâ€”what? Everything. Sounds like a mouse squeaking under a mattress. But Iâ€™ve only just glanced & got the smell of Lit. dinner, Lit. Sup, Lit this that & the otherâ€”& the one remark to the effect that Virginia Woolf of all people, has been given Cowper by Desmond, & likes it! I, who read Cowper when I was 15â€”dâ€”d nonsense.
