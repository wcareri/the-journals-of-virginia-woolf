### Tuesday 5 February

Why should I mind so much Rebecca not answering my letter? Vanity largely, I suppose. I thought she would be glad &c. Never mind. She is a queer ill bred mind, with all the qualities I lack & fear.

Tom to tea, yesterday. An admirable way of seeing him. And how he suffers! Yes: I felt my accursed gift of sympathy rising. He seemed to have got so little joy or satisfaction out of being Tom. Weâ€”L. ratherâ€”argued, about the T & T correspondence. Highly philosophical: on war: suddenly T. spoke with a genuine cry of feeling. About immortality: what it meant to himâ€”I think it was that: anyhow he revealed his passion, as he seldom does. A religious soul: an unhappy man: a lonely very sensitive man, all wrapt up in fibres of self torture, doubt, conceit, desire for warmth & intimacy. And Iâ€™m very fond of himâ€”like him in some of my reserves & subterfuges. Tonight Raymond & Joyce W.: and I dont look forward to it, my spirits damped by Rebecca. A vast sorrow at the back of life this winter. And then my blood rises & I createâ€”yesterday walking by the lake in Regents Park, going to Hugoâ€™s. And I finished the difficult song chapter this morning.

After abusing booksellers yesterday for some time, I said to Tom, do you ever buy a new book? Never he said. And I said, I sometimes buy poetry, thats all. So this accounts for the problem, it strikes me, why authors dont sell: why booksellers dont stock &c &c.
