### Saturday 31 August

Only the Wolves came however. Torrents & floods & rain & wind. Edgar like a corpseâ€”not a pleasant one either. Yawned behind his hand. Sylvia nervous, cat faced, making conversation. Chiefly about gold fish dogs & cars. L. valiant: I did my usual owl with Mrs W. & she said, as my reward, there was no talk she enjoyed more. Went to Lewes first, in the flood, without a rain coat; went to Helen Boyd, two nervous twittering spinsters in a panelled room, about servants: want a 3 day a week girl. Called at Mount Street. Olivers out. Hugh Jones waited an hour at Southease; went home. Angelica did not come. Mercifully, as the party was damp & dismal, sitting till 6.30 in the dining room. How it rains, said Mrs W. The tap had overflowed: the window a ripple of water. Read Hind & Panther. D.H.L. by E. (good) & slept.

Everybody talking about Abysinnia, wh. I cannot spell, nor can I form letters, though the morning has been fluentâ€”E. & Parnellâ€”too fluent. A blowing grey day, laden with water.
