Yes, I ought to have explained why I wrote the Sickert. I always think of things too late. I am reading the Faery Queenâ€”with delight. I shall write about it. I took Angelica shopping. â€œDo you mind if I read the Heir of Redcliffe?â€ she said at tea, amusing me. What a curious sense the clothes sense is! Buying her coat, mine, hearing the women talk, as of race horses, about new skirts. And I am fluttered because I must lunch with Clive tomorrow in my new coat. And I cant think out what I mean about conception: the idea behind F.Q. How to express a kind of natural transition from state to state. And the air of natural beauty. It is better to read the originals. Well, Cliveâ€™s lunch will jump me out of this. And now that the play is over, we must begin to see people here: & go to Hamlet, & plan our spring journey. I am taking a fortnight off fiction. My mind became knotted. I think of making Theresa sing: & so lyricise the argument. Get as far from T (so called after my Sarah & Elvira provisionally). But oh heavens the duck squashyâ€”this is from the pressed duck Jack once gave us. All juice: one squab of juice. I am reading Point Counterpoint. Not a good novel, all raw, uncooked, protesting. A descendant, oddly enough, of Mrs H. Ward: interest in ideas; makes people into ideas.

A man from America returns my letters & says he is glad to see me as I am.
