### Thursday 22 August

Worked in the morning. Finished Marryat. Went to Lewes, very hot day; & bought stores, also distemper. And went to the County Library; full of books. So hot after tea: walked along the river bank; a game of bowls; beaten; dined with Keynesâ€™s. Maynard not wellâ€”rather damp talk. He went. Talk of Abyssinia. Thunderstorm at 3.30. L. made me come & sleep in the upstairs room. It strikes me that I will call this book, Other Peopleâ€™s Houses.
