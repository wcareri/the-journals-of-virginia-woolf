### Wednesday 17 July

Last night as I was sitting alone, L. dining with the Bakers, there were three rings, & I went down & let in Julian, who said â€œI have been given a professorship in China.â€ He was very much excited, rather alarmed, naturallyâ€”it means that he must start in the middle of August & spend 3 years in China at Wu Jong, or some such place, alone on a flooded river. So we talkedâ€”intimately, I mean about the past & our lives, for the first time. Iâ€™m very sorry heâ€™s to goâ€”the delightful, honest bubbly yet after all so sympathetic & trusty young man. Still, obviously this is his first real experience. He had to break off to answer a trunk call from Tony. He said she spoke with almost too much common sense. But he had always determined not to let his private life shackle him. Then he will travel about China in his holidays, & come back a full grown mature man, with a place in the world. He wants to write on politics & philosophy & to enter politics seriously. He says politics have got more & more on his conscience. Theyâ€™re on the conscience of all his generation. So he canâ€™t be merely a poet, a writer. I see his dilemma. So he goes, & Iâ€™m sorry. Three years. He will be thirty & I 56 alas.

Just now I finished my first wild retyping & find the book comes to 740 pages: that is ~~174,890~~ 148,000 words: but L think I can shorten: all the last part is still rudimentary & wants shaping; but Iâ€™m too tired in the head to do it seriously this moment. I think all the same I can reduce it: & thenâ€”? Dear me. I see why I fled, after The Waves, to Flush; One wants simply to sit on a bank & throw stones. I want also to read with a free mind; And to let the wrinkles smooth themselves out. Susie Buchan, Ethel, then Julianâ€”so I talked from 4.30 till 1 am with only 2 hours for dinner & silence.

I think I see that the last chapter slid, be formed round Nâ orthâ€™s speech: it must be much more formal; & I think I see how I can bring in interludesâ€”I mean spaces of silence, & poetry & contrast.
