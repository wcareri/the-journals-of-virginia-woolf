I am so glad I am not lunching with Rebecca West to meet Miss E. Jenkins; at the same I am so sorry that L. wants to spend 3 days at Monks House every fortnight: from Thursday night till Monday morning.

These are my troubles Mrâ€”as the man said when the footman put on too many coals. And I think Iâ€™ve found a bridge in that scene.
