### Monday 16 December

A question, how to do Roger. Why not begin at the end with Le Mas: a whole day; & then work backwards: give the elements in combination in action, first; & then trace themâ€”give specimen days, all through his life.

Le Mas: the mosquitoes &c. his cooking: the colour, the martins: the French novel: freedomâ€”cast back to childhood. Quote. Then Cambridge, then America: then us. Then the end.
