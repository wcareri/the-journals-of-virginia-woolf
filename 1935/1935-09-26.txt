Why is thisâ€”that is the first scene with Sally & Maggie in the bedroom, the most difficult I have ever written?

Winifred Holtby is, I rather suspect, dying. It is a very fine day. Two luggers with brown sails are moving very slowly down the river. We were in London yesterday. And London is in full swing. â€œThe Abyssinians have mobilised!â€ exclaims one suburban lady to another in the bus. And the other says â€œThat was in the paper yesterdayâ€. A great swarm in Rymans where I went to buy a case for my Roger notes. In future I shall write in loose leaf books, & so avoid these swelling pages. Mabel had a very nice lunch. I watched the men in Tâ avistockâ ck Sqre eating on the pavement. They are having the road up with a drill. They eat with the point of the knife. They have lunch wrapped in newspaper. They warm some drink in a bucket. They have at least an hour off. But then I work my brain I say to myself. Belsher ill. Miss West travelling. Our last day up. Very glad to get back here. But the boys are making a bonfire in the field. We pray for a few days peace. Now 2 men want to come tomorrow to discuss the WEA at Rodmell. This must be mastered. L. had a certain amount of row with Kingsley about the L. party & the League.
