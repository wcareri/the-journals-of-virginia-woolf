### Saturday 1 June

My excuse for not beginning my bookâ€”I mean finishing itâ€”is that Iâ€™ve not got the final chapter here. So what shall I do? Read the old one. But thatâ€™s fussing & fidgeting. I think wait till Monday & then flash at it, & get it done by August. Holidays are very upsetting. And its cold & grey. And my hand shakes. And I want some regular hours & work. And itâ€™ll take at least a weeks agony to get back into the mood. And I shall slip back by reading about in the book, & dreaming after tea; & perhaps, if nature allows, taking a walk. L. very depressed too, about poor dear Pink. 8 years of a dog certainly mean something. I supposeâ€”is it part of our life thats buried in the orchard? That 8 years in Londonâ€”our walksâ€”something of our play private life, thats gone? Andâ€”odd how the spring of life isnâ€™t to be tapped at will. I cant get into the swim by saying it is Saturday morning & I will write. I cant get into that stream by standing & wishing it. All sorts of habits, of being unconscious of the surface, attentive to other things, have to settle naturally. Coming back one is horribly broken up, notices surfaces. Habit is the desirable thing in writing.
