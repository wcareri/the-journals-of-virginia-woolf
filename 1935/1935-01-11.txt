### Friday 11 January

I have made a very clever arrangement on the new board that L. gave me for Christmas: ink, pen tray &c I never cease to get pleasure from these clever arrangements. So death will be very dull. There are no letters in the grave, as Dr Johnson said. A very long, rather formal, I mean affected letter from Tom this morning, which I must put away, as it will be so valuable. Did he think that when he was writing it? L. whose modesty is enough to make me blush, heard from Brace yesterday that they anticipate a large sale for Quack Quack. Some ass wants him to call itâ€”some assesâ€™ name. It will be out this spring. This spring will be on us all of a clap. Very windy; today: a damp misted walk two days ago to Piddinghoe. Now the trees are threshing. Nessa & Angelica & Eve yesterday. We talk a great deal about the play. An amusing incident. And I shall hire a donkeys head to take my call inâ€”by way of saying This is a donkeys work. I make out that I shall reduce The Caravan (so called suddenly) to 150,000: & shall finish retyping in May. I wonder. It is compressed I think. And sometimes my brain threatens to split with all the meaning I think I could press into it. The discovery of this book, it dawns upon me, is the combination of the external & the internal. I am using both, freely. And my eye has gathered in a good many externals in its time. See how much more I write about myself than Leonard does about himself. Already engagements are piling; & the lap ahead will be full of the usual jerks & strains. I am going to a Comttee I think at the Oxfords on Wednesday: Tom suggests a fortnightly tea. And thereâ€™s Helen â€¦ I never never invite anyone; but lie like an apron under an apple tree for fruit to drop.

I cant read Dante of a morning after the struggle with fiction. I wish I could find some way of composing my mindâ€”its absurd to let it be ravaged by scenes; when I may not have read all Dante before Iâ€”but why harp on death? On the contrary, it is better to pull on my galoshes & go through the gale to lunch off scrambled egg & sausages. Louie & L. will eat liver. Lambs liver is more tender than calfs, said Louie, thus filling up a blank in my knowledge of the world.
