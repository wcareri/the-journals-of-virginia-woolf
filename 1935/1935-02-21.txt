A good party last night with old Hugh. Hugh on Hollywood. What was interesting though & rather horrifying was his account of his own pain: an agony of pain in his arm, like broken bones twittering incessantly. Agony agony agonyâ€”hadnt realised there could be such pain. Once he burst into tears & sat up shouting. Was conveyed across America in an aeroplane. Saw â€˜the skyâ€™. And then, just as the pain was coming on at Hampstead, at Haroldâ€™s house, a parcel was delivered: a bottle of a quack medicine called Cleano. And he took a dose, & slept; & next day, he was better. And has had no pain since. But what was shocking was to see him an old man. All the buoyancy & taut pink skin gone. Yet difficult to say why one feels this. Something sunk & shuttered in him. Cavities in some lights. I liked him. And I liked his capacity for miraculous rebirth. Six months at Hollywood has completely changed him. When we said something about upper class, he laughed. Classes have been wiped out. He has seen through everything. Given up the Book of the Month; no longer frets about fame & reviews; & is taking to the great new artâ€”the complex & amazing art of colour, music, words all in one. Of course there may be something in it. Mary came; Eth Bowen, & Julian, who as usual annoyed me by denouncing my â€œbrutalityâ€. What an uncomfortable relation, Aunt & nephew. And how nice he is, & how obtuse. But it was a flourishing kind of evening: better I think than the Reads. I rather mean to write to Hugh.

Tea with Nessa & old bass voiced Ethel Walker in her serge suit & red tie. We are to go to a dinner given to her. She told some instalments of her lifeâ€™s history: some repetitions. Was the daughter of a hard bullying clever man. Damn you, you little brute, he said to her. And the cab horse ran away & climbed a six foot wall, while she clasped her mother, a very stout woman, & said â€œScreaming makes it worseâ€.

A letter of explanation & conciliation from Clive. No satire intended. So be it.
