### Tuesday 15 October

Since we came back I have been in such full flush, with Years all the morning, Roger between; tea & dinner, a walk, & people, that hereâ€™s a blank. And I only scamp Roger this evening because I wore a hole in my back yesterday; couldnâ€™t write this morning; & must go up & receive Miss Grueber (to discuss a book on women & fascismâ€”a pure have yer as Lottie would say) in 10 minutes. Yes, it has been 10 days of calm full complete bliss. And I thought how I shall hate it. Not a bit. London is quiet dry comfortable. I find my dinner cooked for me. No children screaming. And the sense of forging ahead easily strongly (this petered out today) at The Years. Three days I got into wild excitement over The Next War. Did I say the result of the L.P. at Brighton was the breaking of that dam between me & the new book, so that I couldnâ€™t resist dashing off a chapter: stopped myself; but have all ready to developâ€”the form found I thinkâ€”as soon as I get time? And I plan to do this sometime this next spring, while I go on accumulating Roger. This division is by the way perfect, & I wonder I never hit on it beforeâ€”some book or work for a book thats quite the other side of the brain between times. Its the only way of stopping the wheels & making them turn the other way, to my great refreshment, & I hope improvement. Alas, now for Grueber.
