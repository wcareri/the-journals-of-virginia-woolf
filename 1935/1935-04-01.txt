### Monday 1 April

At this rate I shall never finish the Purgatorio. But whats the use of reading with half ones mind running on Eleanor & Kitty. Oh that scene wants compacting. Its too thin run. But I shall finish it before I go away. We think of 3 weeks in Holland & France: a week in Rome, flying there. We went to Kew yesterday, & if vegetable notes are needed, this is to signify that yesterday was the prime day for cherry blossom pear trees, & magnolia. A lovely white one with black cups to the flowers: another purple tinted, just falling. Another & another. And the yellow bushes & the daffodils in the grass. So to walk through Richmondâ€”a long walk by the ponds. I verified certain details. And it was 5.30 when we got backâ€”a soft lovely day; & then I read some MSS & we had out maps, & discussed the holiday & Mabel came in & said she had sat for 2 hours in the Piccadilly corner house, watching people & listening to the band. Many people do this, she said. They sit on & on, eating as slowly as possible. She was ashamed how long they had sat. But then they take a long time to bring things she said.

A letter of thanks & admiration from Mrs Morgan this morning. And I gather from Judith that poor old Ann has not passed.
