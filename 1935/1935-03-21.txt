Too jaded again to tackle that very difficult much too crowded raid chapter. In fact I am on the verge of the usual headacheâ€”for one thing yesterday was such a scrambleâ€”I walked so many miles, talked so much difficult political French with a man called Malraux up at Hampstead; having first gone to Q.â€™s private view; the usual mincing & demurring: smart young men; little Robertson whom I met at the Fishers: Clive in his blue suit; Benita in her tight black: & then the constraint with Nessa about her sons artâ€”as usual: am I too critical? Why this difficulty in praising? Bought nothing. Couldnâ€™t think: walked in the hot sun through the Parks to Wâ estminster Took Bus up to Hampstead; stood all the way. Crowded dining room. Mâ alraux the fluent idealogical foreigner. Stephen Spender, Readâ€”other unknowns. Exalted to a kind of eminence among this rag tag. Listened. To be a conference, of artists, in June. Paris in Juneâ€”oh, too tired to note even this, so how can I tackle fiction? Rodmell tomorrowâ€”thank goodness.
