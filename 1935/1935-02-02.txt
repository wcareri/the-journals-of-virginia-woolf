### Saturday 2 February

Poor old Ethel has been rooked Â£1600 by the Treasury on unpaid income tax. She says she wont accept a penny & will pay it out of her income, but she may have to sell Coign. This at 76â€”

Ann to dinner last night: rather pale, rather resolute & melancholy perhaps. Talked of servants & science. She is going in for another Exn at Newnham, & I had to vouch for her character to the Mistress of Girton. Rather a queer comment upon the independence of family control. Hadnt even told her parents about these formalities. Karin only seen in bed of a morning, Adrian seldom, the house full of lodgers & patients, Ann found going off alone to get a meal. An attractive girl; but uncombed; independent, proud of Stephen blood; much brought up by school mistresses; contemptuous of exams; wishes to be a doctor, & live in Geneva. Judith a great admirer of Hazlitt, & writes essays in secret.

Headachy all day. Walked to Chancery Lane in bitter rain about my spectacles, & am going to experiment with an improved version of a lorgnette. I wrote in praise of Rebeccaâ€™s book to Rebecca, & have had no answer. This I did because of the talk at Charleston, when they said how much pleasure such letters gave. I expect I have (somehow) given pain. But its no great matter. My conscience, as they say, is clear. And now I must write to Eth Williamson, about Ethel.
