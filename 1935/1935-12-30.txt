### Monday 30 December

And today, no its no go. I cant write a word; too much headache. Can only look back at The Years as an inaccessible Rocky Island, which I cant explore, cant even think of. At Charleston yesterday. The great yellow table with very few places. Reading Roger I become haunted by him. What an odd posthumous friendshipâ€”in some ways more intimate than any I had in life. The things I guessed are now revealed; & the actual voice gone. Clive Quentin, Nessa Duncan. A little boasting. Some laughter over Mrs Easdale. Politicsâ€”but carefully subdued.

I had an ideaâ€”I wish theyâ€™d sleepâ€”while dressingâ€”how to make my war bookâ€”to pretend its all the articles editors have asked me to write during the past few yearsâ€”on all sorts of subjects. Shd. women smoke. Short skirts. Warâ€”&c. This wd give me the right to wander: also put me in the position of the one asked. And excuse the method: while giving continuity. And there might be a preface saying this, to give the right tone. I think thats got it. A wild wet nightâ€”floods out: rain as I go to bed: dogs barking: wind battering. Now I shall slink indoors, I think, & read some remote book.
