### Thursday 29 August

I had meant to write one matter of fact note daily, but have never had time. My brain all tossing after the mornings work. Julian is leaving Newhaven at this moment I suppose for 3 years. I have been doing the scene of Eleanorâ€™s day with the usual pangs & ecstasies. On Tuesday we went to Sissinghurst; lost L.â€™s spectacles, & the meat on the top of the car. Saw the great new room. Vita in trousers. Rather woke my affection & regret. Harold gave me Mrs Lindberghâ€™s book. Woke my insensate obsessionâ€”to write P & Pâ€”by telling me how a room of ones own is regarded & my American fame. The big Alsatian hunting; the pink tower & the rain on the leaves, L. said, falling as he had not heard it since Ceylon. To dine at Charleston. Julian a little depressed. Duncan laughing about Lady Blancheâ€”his name for G. St Aubyn. Grouse. Nessa composed. Quentin in bed with throat. I very sleepy. Kissed J. in the dark garden. We think of going to China, at any rate think so, to mitigate the parting. Yesterday very drowsy. Walked the Tristram Grove & river walk. L. came to meet me & missed me. Louieâ€™s child attacked by dog. Took it to Lewes. Mr Hancock brought in with injured leg. Very bad. Bach at night; Man playing oboe fainted in the middle. War seems inevitable. I won one game of bowls out of 3. Reading Miss Mole, AbbÃ© Dunnet (good), an occasional bite at Hind & Panther, but brain too expanded. Oh to be done with the book & my own mistress again. Piles of Rogerâ€™s papers sent by Margeryâ€”a whole box. I have now 3 large boxes, but dare not look in, & am terribly obsessed by P. & P.
