### Friday 8 February

Wright to lunch yesterday: Miss Delafield passes me in the square: the Holtby type; dine with Nessa; & oh dear, how the ghost of Roger haunted us! What a dumb misery life is for her: Clark had been in; hadnt seen anything of what Roger would have seen. An extraordinary sense of him: of wishing for him; of vacancy. A letter from Margery, who is bringing documents, & wants to see me next week. Excited about Ordinary]. Pâ eople & no letter from Rebecca. My desk a failure.
