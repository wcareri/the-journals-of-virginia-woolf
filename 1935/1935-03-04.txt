### Monday 4 March

It was a charming grey distinguished expedition too: to Walton; & we walked by the river, & said it was like a French picture. The grey trees, the weir churning, the bridge, the white cupola, & a lion in marble. L. finished Quack Quack the day before.

Yesterday I did not enjoy. What a guzzler old Ethel has become. She guzzled our very tough jobs, till I could not sit still. She is a greedy old woman; I dont like greed when it comes to champing & chawing & sweeping up gravy. And she gets red, drinking. Then the concert. How long how little music in it that I enjoyed! Beechamâ€™s face beaming, ecstatic, like a yellow copper idol: such grimaces, attenuations, dancings, swingings: his collar crumpled. Old Hugh in the stalls. I went down, & saw him, tragic, sitting alone like an old man. What is there tragic now in his expression? Some loneliness, & pain. He did not know me at once: then promised of course to send Ethel a bottle that very night. Oh no, I said. â€œItâ€™s very slowâ€ he said. And was for a moment touched by my concern.

So back to Ethel. In the artists room afterwards there was ZÃ©lie with the red lips, & another ex prima donna & a dissolute musician, all waiting their turn to plague Beecham. Et toiâ€”ZÃ©lie suddenly burst into song; but it was 25 years ago that she had her success, since when â€¦ And they hinted & shrugged that poor old Ethel was a well known imposition upon conductors. Out she came in her spotted cats fur with her hat askew, carrying her brown cardboard despatch box, upon which theyâ€”the tight hard old prima donnas, fell on her & larded her with praise. (They had played the Wreckers overture.) Who are they I said. Havent an idea, she replied. So we had tea at the Langham, which I dont mind so much as meat & gravy. And then I could stand that stab of a voice emphasising, I dont know what, no longer; & said I must go. It was a Sunday evening drizzle in the street, an 1849 night, as we padded very slowly to the Tube: & thank God, she vanished. I was out of temper. But L. miraculously enchanted me again by persuading me not to have Italian lessons from Castelliâ . For some reason this decision has given me a divine sense of immunity which wraps me round this morning. I am a toad in an oak again: neglected, at ease, completely happy. Nessa & Julian came round to us, for a wonder, after dinner. And we talked about Roger & Margeryâ€™s incestuous love. Julian at his best, weighty, reasonable & mature. Thats being with Nessa, I suppose. I said how I tried to â€˜rattleâ€™ L. into going to the Walker dinner.
