### Tuesday 10 December

I have only 3 minutes before the clock strikes, & not much paper left. I spend my spare hour or half hour reading Roger to Helenâ€”that explains. And next year I shall have a loose leaf book. So many people again. Nelly Cecil yesterday. I like her. Better than Colefax who cut me for Madame dâ€™Erlanger. Thats a joke. Clive intends to spread it & rub it in: never mind.

I have promised to deliver The Years by 15th Feb. And had a bad mornings work in consequence. And Angus & Mary Fisher tonight. But if I want more time, I shall take it. Iâ€™m not timeâ€™s foolâ€”no. Save that I must go up to lunch. Always write as if a cynical eye, doubting were on me. Nessa I thought very sad again, dining with Clive. What thin stuff we talk compared with what we used to talk. And then people say death doesnt matter. Clive hopping on his canary perch: V. very silent: L. too. Bought stuff for a dress, pretty stuff to amuse myself.
