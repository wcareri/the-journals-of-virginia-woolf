Last night at Nessaâ€™s, talk all very chippy & choppy with Clive oddly inattentive, & a sense of unreality, & a great desire for Roger. Again the sense of him coming in with his great dark eyes, & his tie pin & his brown shoes & how, speaking in that very deep voice he would have discussed Max Eastman & Epstein. We only flick the surfaceâ€”some means of communicationâ€”some other instrument needed to combine us all in harmony. Stories that would have amused him. How he wd have laughed at Nessaâ€™s story of the party at Lady Harrisâ€™s when they had the lantern slides of the tigers. And all would have been deepened, & made suggestive. But never mind. This is inevitable, & we must blow on the bellows. So I tried to be nice about Quentin. And this morning, in spite of being in a rage, I wrote the whole of that dâ€”d chapter again, in a spasm of desperation & I think got it right, by breaking up, the use of thought skipping, & parentheses. Anyhow thats the hang of it. And I cut from 20 to 30 pages.
