### Saturday 13 December

Ponsonby, no doubt I meant to add. But that is all faded out. And this diary may die, not of London, but of the Press. For 14 days we have been in the thick of a long press revolutionâ€”Dadie going Marjorie going, Marjorie staying, Angus Davidson coming. That is the final result, but achieved only at the cost of 40 million words. For my own part, I could never see Dadie as a permanent partner, Dadie in his silver grey suits, pink shirts, with his powdered pink & white face, his nerves, his manners, his love of praise. Angus, however, after 3 days, already seems to me permanent & dependable. As I always talk of money here, & compliments & rebuffs, first I will own that my pamphlet is the worst seller of them all, then that Harperâ€™s offer me â€œat least Â£50â€ for a Times leader article! And once upon a time I was trying to get Â£15 out of Jack Squire! So I am suggesting 3 articles a year, to Richmond; & this, if it fructifies, will help us on the road to giving up the Nation, to which goal I look always, though the place has many perquisites.

I am now galloping over Mrs Dalloway, re-typing it entirely from the start, which is more or less what I did with the V.O. a good method, I believe, as thus one works with a wet brush over the whole, & joins parts separately composed & gone dry. Really & honestly I think it the most satisfactory of my novels (but have not read it coldbloodedly yet). The reviewers will say that it is disjointed because of the mad scenes not connecting with the Dalloway scenes. And I suppose there is some superficial glittery writing. But is it â€œunrealâ€? Is it mere accomplishment? I think not. And as I think I said before, it seems to leave me plunged deep in the richest strata of my mind. I can write & write & write now: the happiest feeling in the world.

A London winter is full of bright rooms, passages through dark streets to scenes of brilliancy; but I only recall teaâ€™s with Ethel Sands, a lunch with Ly Colefax, Sybil by the way she is now, a party last night at Gumboâ€™s, which being undress & easy going gave me a good deal of pleasure. Ray is precisely like a very fine tabby, which, having been castrated, has grown to an enormous size, & never moves. She sits smiling out of her green blue cats eyes. She is sending us, rather to my trepidation, her new novel. There was also Julia Strachey whom I cross examined; the gifted wastrel. Leys & Vita are both in great demand, Simkin ordering them urgently this morning, & Angus going off in a hurry. But I will not let the Press entirely devour this page. I am rather cross with Marjorie, about her objecting to my criticism of her private life; & then taking 3 weeks holiday, which will leave us very little, & heaven knows when. But then she seems in a state of nervesâ€”terrified of getting ill, terrified of leaving us, jumpy, unhappy, now on edge, now obsequious, having Tom Marshall about the place, & Ralph Wright & Cyril to divorce, which, to my thinking, distract her mind from her work, & lessen my chances of selling my books. But the thing to aim at is an impersonal, amicable business relation I am sure, now we have Angus, less sympathy & more work.

Whatever they may say, Vita & Clive & Lytton, people crowd to the press, & canâ€™t be beaten off. Bernadette Murphy was ready to come. Angus dropped like ripe fruit from the tree. Vita explains that the Heir of Redcliffe, her cousin, implores her to resist the contamination of Bloomsbury, personified in the serpent destroyer, V.W. I half like, half mind this.
