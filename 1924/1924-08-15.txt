### Friday 15 August

Into all these calculations, broke the death of Conrad, followed by a wire from the Lit. Sup. earnestly asking me kindly to do a leader on him, which flattered & loyal, but grudgingly, I did; & its out; & that number of the Lit. Sup. corrupted for me (for I cant, & never shall be able to, read my own writings. Moreover, now little Walkleyâ€™s on the war path again I expect a bite next Wednesday). Yet I have never never worked so hard. For, having to do a leader in 5 days, I made hay after teaâ€”& couldnâ€™t distinguish tea hay from morning hay either. So doesnâ€™t this give me two extra hours for critical works anyhow (as Logan calls them)? So Iâ€™m trying itâ€”my fiction before lunch, & then essays after tea. For I see that Mrs Dalloway is going to stretch beyond October. In my forecasts I always forgot some most important intervening scenes: I think I can go straight at the grand party & so end; forgetting Septimus, which is a very intense & ticklish business, & jumping Peter Walsh eating his dinner, which may be some obstacle too. But I like going from one lighted room to another, such is my brain to me; lighted rooms; & the walks in the fields are corridors; & now to day Iâ€™m lying & thinking. By the way, why is poetry wholly an elderly taste? When I was 20, in spite of Thoby who used to be so pressing & exacting, I could not for the life of me read Shakespeare for pleasure; now it lights me as I walk to think I have 2 acts of King John tonight, & shall next read Richard the 2nd. It is poetry that I want nowâ€”long poems. Indeed Iâ€™m thinking of reading Thomsonâ€™s The Seasons. I want the concentration & the romance, & the words all glued together, fused, glowing: have no time to waste any more on prose. Yet this must be the very opposite to what people say. When I was 20 I liked 18th Century prose; I liked Hakluyt, MerimÃ©e. I read masses of Carlyle, Scottâ€™s life & letters, Gibbon, all sorts of two volume biographies, & Shelley. Now its poetry I want, so I repeat like a tipsy sailor in front of a public house.

We went to Charleston, & the Keynesâ€™ (so they are now called) with Robertson in attendance came here. Lydia (I called her Rezia by mistake) leaves crumbs sticking to her face. And Maynard is grown very thick & opulent; but I like him for his innocency. At Charleston theres the fat boy in split blue cotton trousersâ€”Quentin that is; almost a street sight, now that hes back, fatter than ever. Julian rather nervous & fine drawn in comparison; & old Roger lean, brown, & truculent, attacking first Shaw, then Conrad, & taking L.â€™s journalism as literally & bellicosely as usual. O these Quakers! I donâ€™t think heâ€™s very happy though, & that affair at Havre gnaws at him, in the midst of family life, Iâ€™ve no doubt.

I dont often trouble now to describe cornfields & groups of harvesting women in loose blues & reds & little staring yellow frocked girls. But thats not my eyesâ€™ fault: coming back the other evening from Charleston, again all my nerves stood upright, flushed, electrified (whats the word?) with the sheer beautyâ€”beauty abounding & superabounding, so that one almost resents it, not being capable of catching it all, & holding it all at the moment. This progress through life is made immensely interesting by trying to grasp all these developments as one passes. I feel as if I were putting out my fingers tentatively on (here is Leonard, who has ordered me a trap in which to drive Dadie to Tilton tomorrow) either side as I grope down a tunnel, rough with odds & ends. And I dont describe encounters with herds of Aldemeys anymoreâ€”though this would have been necessary some years agoâ€”how they barked & belled like stags round Grizzle; & how I waved my stick & stood at bay; & thought of Homer as they came flourishing & trampling towards me: some mimic battle. Grizzle grew more & more insolent & excited & skirmished about yapping. Ajax? That Greek, for all my ignorance, has worked its way into me.

Mayor is printing her second edition, Stephen doing very well, Leys publishing. Nancy Cunard estimating, Mrs Devonshire â€¦ rejecting; business very brisk all round, I issuing a circular to all exhibitors at the Royal Academy of Duncanâ€™s book. Marjorie meanwhile convalesces, presumably, & the question of her future with us comes up to be decided.
