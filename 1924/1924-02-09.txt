### Saturday 9 February

We have been measuring the flat. Now the question arises Is it noisy? No need to go into my broodings over that point. Fitzroy Sqre rubbed a nerve bare which will never sleep again while an omnibus is in the neighbourhood. My feeling about this move is that weâ€™re doing the courageous thing; facing the facts, which for ten years, it will be good to do. Yes, this little achievement has been good I think.

Morgan was here last night; A Passage to India done; & he is much excited, on the boil with it, consulting L. about terms; has been offered Â£750. So heâ€™s all right. And Heinemann this morning wants to publish my essays. Hendersons to dine, & Janet Vaughan, I boasted of L. (he says). One cant joke with people one doesnâ€™t know. They donâ€™t even take dinner in the basement naturally. Desmond pitched down Maryâ€™s stairs two nights ago, & broke his knee cap. Clive couldnâ€™t stay with him. He was in great pain, but Ethel Sands said, very brave. Now heâ€™s very irritable. So our feelings for our friends change. Cut me anywhere, & I bleed too profusely. Life has bred too much â€˜feelingâ€™ of a kind in me. Then (Iâ€™m so tired with parcels &c I cant concentrate) Marjorie has put earrings in her ears & left Joad. Poor chit! at 24. I was at Fitzroy then, & devilish unhappy too. She found a letter, left the house,â€”lives in a basement. Its melodrama, but forced on her by Cyril I expect. Iâ€™m working at The Hours, & think it a very interesting attempt; I may have found my mine this time I think. I may get all my gold out. The great thing is never to feel bored with oneâ€™s own writing. That is the signal for a changeâ€”never mind what, so long as it brings interest. And my vein of gold lies so deep, in such bent channels. To get it I must forge ahead, stoop & grope. But it is gold of a kind I think. Morgan said I had got further into the soul in Jacobâ€™s Room than any other novelist. He was taking piano lessons from Hilda Saxeâ€”spun his fingers very nimbly on the score. (And itâ€™s just as noisy here, if one listens, as it can possibly be in Tâ avistock Sâ quare. One gets into a habit of not listening. Remember this sage advice). Tom, the incredible Tom, writes â€œI do not take any prevision of antagonismâ€ saluting some new review. Meredith white & laurel crowned could not be more magisterial.

Karin has been confiding. Adrian wants to come back. She wants life. I dont altogether like her, kicking up her heels, yet see her point, & respect her conscience, for she has A. on her mind. He sits alone in Mecklenburgh Sqre. â€˜Its the quality you Stephens have she said. Its the real thingâ€™ like an American with a Sheraton table. Faith Henderson says she flirted with Ralph, wants moonlight, big men, diamonds, kisses; but is too old; & not good enough. Hubert takes his views from her. Janet has the Vaughan rattle in her throat; a lady; large, gawky, will marry & breed.
