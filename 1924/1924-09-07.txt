### Sunday 7 September

It is a disgrace that I write nothing, or if I write, write sloppily, using nothing but present participles. I find them very useful in my last lap of Mrs D. There I am nowâ€”at last at the party, which is to begin in the kitchen, & climb slowly upstairs. It is to be a most complicated spirited solid piece, knitting together everything & ending on three notes, at different stages of the staircase, each saying something to sum up Clarissa. Who shall say these things? Peter, Richard, & Sally Seton perhaps: but I donâ€™t want to tie myself down to that yet. Now I do think this might be the best of my endings, & come off, perhaps. But I have still to read the first chapters, & confess to dreading the madness rather; & being clever. However, Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ve now got to work with my pick at my seam, if only because my metaphors come free, as they do here. Suppose one can keep the quality of a sketch in a finished & composed work? That is my endeavour. Anyhow, none can help & none can hinder me any more. Iâ€™ve been in for a shower of compliments too from The Times, Richmond rather touching me by saying that he gives way to my novel with all the will in the world. I should like him to read my fiction, & always suppose he doesnâ€™t.

We had Dadie twice to stay; Clive & Mary yesterday; I slept a night at Charleston; L. went to Yorkshire: rather an odd disjointed wet summer, with people dropping in, Nelly rather moping, but loyal, Asheham offered us one evening by Mr Gunn, as he was poking his corn cocks, & looking at their blackness. I was tempted after 24 hours to buy it. We might get it for Â£1,500. But then it is dark & damp; & the loveliness might not quite compensate. The garden here flourishes. We put off deciding. We could let it of course, which we could not this, so that to fear being tied is no doubt foolish. Norman Leys was here one night; making it quite plain that only certain sorts of people could pass the eye of his needle; & paring one down very quick; one of these good sturdy uncompromising men, whom Mâ argaret Llâ ewelyn, Dâ avies would like, very able, trusty; paying no attention to art of any kind, & enforcing his virtue at every turnâ€”but it is virtue of course. â€œThey belong to the gentlemanly side of the familyâ€¦â€ Distrusts Oxford. Wishes to write as clearly as he can, hopes to live in the East end & educate working men. Wife spends Â£150 on garden; this distressing, but her only pleasure. Doesnâ€™t like taking fees, wh. mean that children go without boots. Thought me Thackerayâ€™s daughter & was only reassured when I cleared away dinner, & talked of religion, morality, his quarrel with the Colonial office, how he was besieged; protests too much in short; but a very nice man.
