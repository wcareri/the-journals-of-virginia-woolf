### Monday 21 December

Really it is a disgraceâ€”the number of blank pages in this book! The effect of London on diaries is decidedly bad. This is I fancy the leanest of them all, & I doubt that I can take it to Rodmell, or if I did, whether I could add much. Indeed it has been an eventful year, as I prophesied; & the dreamer of Jan. 3rd has dreamt much of her dream true; here we are in London, with Nelly alone, Dadie gone it is true, but Angus to replace him. What emerges is that changing houses is not so cataclysmic as I thought; after all one doesnâ€™t change body or brain. Still I am absorbed in â€œmy writingâ€, putting on a spurt to have Mrs D. copied for L. to read at Rodmell; & then in I dart to deliver the final blows to the Common Reader, & thenâ€”then I shall be free. Free at least to write out one or two more stories which have accumulated. I am less & less sure that they are stories, or what they are. Only I do feel fairly sure that I am grazing as near as I can to my own ideas, & getting a tolerable shape for them. I think there is less & less wastage. But I have my ups & downs. As for fame & money, Cliveâ€™s long article on me is out in The Dial. Â£50, apparently, from Harper. Clearly, as L. said, we are safe to make, both of us, as much as we want by our pens. Never again, I daresay, shall we agitate about getting Â£15 from Jack Squire.

So much of my time goes talkingâ€”talking to strays in the basement, to particular people like Ethel Sands, Elena Richmond, Vita, up here, that when I write, I tend to meditate; to sing my own praises, & sum up the months work.

How sharply society brings one outâ€”or rather others out! Roger the other night with Vita for instance. He became the nonconformist undergraduate at once, the obstinate young man, (I could see him quite young with his honest uncompromising eyes) who will not say what he does not believe to be true. The effect on Vita was disastrous; & pure honesty is a doubtful quality; it means often lack of imagination. It means self assertiveness, being rather better than other people; a queer trait in Roger to unearth after so many years of smooth intercourse. For the most part he is so sympathetic. His Quaker blood protests against Vitaâ€™s rich winy fluid; & she has the habit of praising & talking indiscriminately about art, which goes down in her set, but not in ours. It was all very thorny until that good fellow Clive came in, & addressed himself to conciliate dear old obtuse, aristocratic, passionate, Grenadier like Vita. Then came Sprott; a dull dog if ever there was one.

We have also seen Aldington, who calls like a tradesman for orders; a bluff, powerful, rather greasy eyed, nice downright man, who will make his way in the world, which I dont much like people to do. All young men do it. No young women; or in women it is trounced; in men forgiven. Its these reflections I want to enmesh, in writing; or these are among them.

Marjorie & I kissedâ€”there above the little grave we kissed again with tears. My coldness, she said, had made it impossible for her to work. We explained, standing in the doorway. I like her; I like her inner integrity, after cutting through that rather cheap, bargain counter like surface.

All our Bloomsbury relationships flourish, grow in lustiness. Suppose our set to survive another 20 years, I tremble to think how thickly knit & grown together it will be. At Christmas I must write & ask Lytton if I may dedicate the common reader to him. And thats the last of my books to be dedicated, I think. What do we talk about? I wish I could write conversations.

With Elena we discussed womenâ€™s dress; she sitting there so matronly & ornate, in a S. Kensington way, with pearls, & a tiger trimmed black coat, all black, substantial, & middleaged.

â€œI love driving. I went with my grandmother on a driving tour, with Kentish horses. We did about 20 miles a day. I was at a party the other night when everyone said how charming Mrs Carnegie (you remember Mrs Chamberlain, Virginia?) looked, dressed in a fitting pink dress, cut low: every single woman in the room was dressed in a chemisette dress of georgette.â€ Dadie was a great success. â€œThat enchanting creatureâ€ she called him, relieved I think to meet a human being here.

Vita talked about criticism. Ly G. Wellesley wants to found a 2nd Hawthornden prize for poets only. I said it should be for critics. What are critics, said Vita; & added, being engagingly a student of reviews of her own books, a little ink steeped indeed, that no two critics took the same view. This started Roger on aesthetic criticism, constructive criticism.

We go over the same things, undoubtedly. The press however is always casting up wreckage. People come most days. I enjoy my printing afternoons, & think it the sanest way of lifeâ€”for if I were always writing, or merely recouping from writing, I should be like an inbreeding rabbit,â€”my progeny becoming weakly albinos. A man called Peter Miller met at Gumboâ€™s confirmed me in this the other night. One meets a good many men now. Theres a little thrush like creature called Tomlin who wants to sculpt me. This afternoon they cut down the tree at the back the tree I used to see from my basement skylight.
