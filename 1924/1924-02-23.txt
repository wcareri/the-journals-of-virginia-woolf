### Saturday 23 February

Really Iâ€™ve a thousand things to do. Iâ€™ve just said to L. Iâ€™m so busy I canâ€™t begin, which unfortunately is too true of me. My mind sits in front of a fence & pours out clouds of ideas; I have to stick spurs in sharp to make it jump. I should be reading Miss Mayorâ€™s first chapters; Miss Bosanquet on Henry James & the Birds. Then I bethink me that with life in its present rush, I may never again write a word of this book at Hogarth House. & so should take a few minutes to lay the sod, or whatever the expression is. Its very cold, barbarous weather. Twice we have meant to go to Rodmell & failed. L. says Wells says there comes a stage when one canâ€™t face an uncomfortable week end. Warmth is the one need I have. Mayâ€™s Man, a great giant in gaiters who shook L. by the hand because we are real people & own a press, came today, & will move us on March 13th for Â£15. Nessa gets busy at 52 Tavy on Monday. I am going to force L. into the outrageous extravagance of spending Â£25 on painted panels, by Bell & Grant. We are trying to hook together all the resources of civilisationâ€”telephone, gas, electric light, &, at this distance, naturally find it arduous. The electric light man doesnâ€™t turn up. Lottie is going to Karinâ€”I fancy I have forgotten that item. Really, if providence had tried, or I had set my wits to work at their most optimistic, I donâ€™t think I could have arranged things better. First number 52 & its studio (wh. we think to make Â£75 on) then Saxon coming here; then Lottie next door, & so keeping Nelly in society. All could not have fallen out better, so far, I say, being by no means ready to bait the deity, who can always show his claws. That reminds me of the celebrated Mr Bertrand Russell the other night at Karinâ€™s. (She gives her weekly party in the great gay drawingroom which is nevertheless a little echoing & lofty & very very chill). He said â€œJust as I saw a chance of happiness, the doctors said I had got cancer. My first thought was that that was one up to God. He had brought it offâ€”just as I thought I saw a chance of happiness. When I was just getting betterâ€”I had very nearly diedâ€”my temperature was 107 twice overâ€”the thing I liked was the sun: I thought how nice to feel the sun & the rain still. People came a long way after that. I wanted people very much, but not so much as the sun. The old poets were right. They made people think of death as going where they could not see the sun. I have become an optimist. I realise now that I like lifeâ€”I want to live. Before that illness, I thought life was bad. Its an odd thingâ€”both my pessimism & my optimism are instinctiveâ€ (I forget which he said was the deeper of the two.) So to Charlie Sanger, who is good all through; & then on to Moore. â€œWhen he first came up to Cambridge, he was the most wonderful creature in the whole world. His smile was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. We believed in Berkeleyâ€ (perhaps). â€œSuddenly, something went wrong with him; something happened to him and his work. Principia Ethica was nothing like so good as his Essay on Judgment (?). He was very fond of Ainsworth. I donâ€™t know what happenedâ€”It ruined him. He took to putting out his tongue after that. You (I, that is) said he had no complexes. But heâ€™s full of them. Watch him putting his tongue round his mouth. I said to him once, Moore, have you ever told a lie? â€œYESâ€ he saidâ€”which was the only lie he ever told. He always speaks the truth at the Aristotelian. An old gentleman met me on my way here, & asked if I were going. No; I said (not such a fool). Joad is speaking tonight. Haldane made a speech once, & old Shad Hodgson had to pass a vote of thanks. He had had an epileptic fit that afternoon. He got up & talked nonsenseâ€”utter nonsense. So they asked me. And I had to thank Haldane, though Iâ€™d got ready to criticise every argument he used. Never mind: I put them all into an article, & that stung much sharper.â€ I asked him, as I ask everyone, to write his life for the press. But my mind is absolutely relevant. I cant ramble. I stick to facts. â€œFacts are what we want. Now the colour of your motherâ€™s hairâ€™?â€™ â€œShe died when I was twoâ€”there you areâ€”relevant facts. I remember my grandfatherâ€™s death, & crying, & then thinking it was over. I saw my brother drive up in the afternoon. Hooray! I cried. They told me I must not say hooray at all that day. I remember the servants all looking very attentively at me when I was brought to Pembroke Lodge after my father died. Whiteheadâ€™s father, who was the local parson, was sent for to persuade me that the earth was round. I said it was flat. And I rememberâ€”some seaside place, now destroyedâ€”remembered the sands, I think. He had no one to play with. One does not like him. Yet he is brilliant of course; perfectly outspoken; familiar; talks of his bowels; likes people; & yet & yetâ€”He disapproves of me perhaps? He has not much body of character. This luminous vigorous mind seems attached to a flimsy little car, like that on a large glinting balloon. His adventures with his wives diminish his importance. And he has no chin, & he is dapper. Nevertheless, I should like the run of his headpiece. We parted at the corner of the Square; no attempt to meet again.
