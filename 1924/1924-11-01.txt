### Saturday 1 November

I must make some notes of work; for now I must buckle to. The question is how to get the 2 books done. I am going to skate rapidly over Mrs D. but it will take time. No: I cannot say anything much to the point, for what I must do is to experiment next week; how much revision is needed, & how much time it takes. I am very set on getting my essays out before my novel. Yesterday I had tea in Maryâ€™s room & saw the red lighted tugs go past & heard the swish of the river: Mary in black with lotus leaves round her neck. If one could be friendly with women, what a pleasureâ€”the relationship so secret & private compared with relations with men. Why not write about it? truthfully? As I think, this diary writing has greatly helped my style; loosened the ligatures.

We had a party the other nightâ€”S. Sassoon; R. Mortimer, Duncan, Vanessa. Nancy Cunard should have comeâ€”the little anxious flibbertigibbet with the startled honest eyes, & all the green stones hung about her. We met at Raymondâ€™s, & she slipped into easy desperate-sounding chatter, as if she didnâ€™t mind saying everythingâ€”everythingâ€”had no shadows no secret placesâ€”lived like a lizard in the sun, & yet was by nature for the shade. And I should be re-reading her poem to choose a title. As usual, I am, or think myself, snowed under with work to do; & this is cut into by hours of solid pleasureâ€”going to the pictures tonight; & Suggia on Monday. For its music I want; to stimulate & suggest.

We went to Hamspray on a wet misty day, & saw what the view might be in the sun; a flat meadow with trees in groups like people talking leading to the downs. We walked to the top with Carrington; but the young men, P. Ritchie & Senhouse, are a little simple mindedâ€”for Lytton likes that sort, & thus blankets himself. Carrington was as if recently beaten by Ralph. Is she really rather dull, I asked myself? or merely a sun flower out of the sun? We came home in the rain, & a man stopped L. to ask if his dog was a bitch: an angler, he was, & I wanted to ask had he caught a fish. We travelled down with Sydney. Being rather ashamed of my temperâ€”for one should never wall off people on theoryâ€”I was affable, yet discreet. Talked the whole time, but did not suggest future meetings. We hit it off successfully I think. Did I want John Franklin to be lenient to Mrs Dalloway? Not, I think, very seriously, & I see no harm in being faithful to old semi-friendships. His little boy is what he cares for, I imagine; & there was less protestation than usual. Murry is â€œtremendousâ€ on Keats & Shâ akespeaâ re; Lawrence â€œtremendousâ€ too; but a megalomaniac. They started a publishing house, like ours; which went smash, or never started, which had killed Kotâ€™s hopes; & Lawrence, who thought the whole of London would flock after him to Mexico, has retired there with Brett alone. All this Sydney sees clearly & comicly, but intimates that there are depths beneath. I rather think the poor monster is clambering out, though. Now, for goodness sake, let me read a littleâ€”It is reading, not writing, that suffers in Londonâ€”
