### Saturday 21 June

I am oh so sleepy; in fact just woken from a hot drowse. This week is Apostles week, & we went to a disillusioned party last night, after which L. contemplated, seriously, some scientific form of suicide. I have my moods too. If I werenâ€™t so sleepy, I would write about the soul. I think its time to cancel that vow against soul description. What was I going to say? Something about the violent moods of my soul. How describe them, even with a waking mind? I think I grow more & more poetic. Perhaps I restrained it, & now, like a plant in a pot, it begins to crack the earthenware. Often I feel the different aspects of life bursting my mind asunder. Morgan is too restrained in his new book perhaps. I mean, whatâ€™s the use of facts at our time of life? Why build these careful cocoons: why not say straight outâ€”yes, but what?

I met Sydney Waterlow last night, & was monolithic on purpose,â€”a bad thing to be; but I feared gushing & depths, & intended to keep myself free. He no doubt prescribes speaking out. Murry is married again; & I donâ€™t often think of Katherine with any vividness.

I look forward with a little alarm to Dadie coming, chiefly I think that it commits us more seriously. But that will wear off soon. It seems to me the beginning of ten years of very hard work, because, for one thing, I should hate failure, & not to fail, we must keep on pressing forward, thinking, planning, imagining, letter writing, asking Vita to write, &c &c Siegfried Sassoon to write, accepting Nancy Cunard; I dont see how Marjorie will fit in, altogether, & rather anticipate some rearrangement. So far, no gossip & no soul. Yet Iâ€™ve seenâ€”Bob, Desmond, Lytton, Sebastian, Dorothy Bussy, Mrs Eliotâ€”this last making me almost vomit, so scented, so powdered, so egotistic, so morbid, so weakly; & I already stale & talk sore with the rest of our doings. I am writing, writing, & see my way clear to the end now, & so shall gallop to it, somehow or other. But 1 am invaded by drowsiness; & cant write out what I had in my head to write before tea; canâ€™t even remember what it was; but shall go down to the basement where L. is printing, & then round to Gordon Sqre & then home to dinner, & then finish Romeo & Juliet by the open window, in spite of the noise, with the lovely view, & so to sleep; & to wake & all the rest of it.
