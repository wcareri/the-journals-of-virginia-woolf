### Saturday 14 June

Back from Whitsun at Rodmell, & just off to sit in Gordon Sqre with Nessa & Angelica; so my diary will be defrauded; stifled by too much life. The unrecorded clogs my pen. Rogerâ€™s story at the Etoile the other night was perhaps my most sensational piece of news. â€œSomething dreadful has happened to meâ€ he said, staring very steadily with his great wide open eyes. At which I, being frivolous, laughed. â€œBut it was dreadful,â€ upon wh. to the credit of my heart, it stopped beating, expecting cancer. And then he told me the story of the mad French peasant woman who shot herself for love of him on the cliff at Havre looking towards England. â€œAnd so my last chance of happiness is goneâ€ said Roger. And so we walked town Tottenham Court Rd in the pouring rain, I protesting affection, & Roger saying that he was fated; he was cursed; he had never had more than 3 weeks happiness in his life. â€œI have pleasureâ€”I enjoy my friendsâ€”but no happiness.â€ I see what he means. And heâ€™s so young, he saysâ€”& so fond of women. To which Nessa adds, pertinently, that heâ€™ll recover, & do it again. For of course we cant help becoming cynical & merry. To hear us, gulls like Ott. (whoâ€™s been here contaminating the June night) would think we were heartless. But how long can Roger love a woman without driving her mad? This creature thought he laughed at her, seeing that he dyed vests yellow & sent them to her, telling her to turn to the East & put them on, as a cure for tuberculosis. And he sent her pictures of negro sculpture. For some reason, against my habit, I feel as if I should like to write a story of this.
