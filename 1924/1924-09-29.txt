### Monday 29 September

A fortnight later: writing partly to test my new penkala (professing fountain qualities) partly to exorcise my demon. Only Karin & Ann: only a hole blown in my last chapter. There I was swimming in the highest ether known to me, & thinking Iâ€™d finish by Thursday; Lottie suggests to Karin weâ€™d like to have Ann: Karin interprets my polite refusal to her own advantage & comes down herself on Saturday, blowing everything to smithereens. More & more am I solitary; the pain of these upheavals is incalculable; & I cant explain it either. She saw nothing. â€œDisturbing the flow of inspiration?â€ she said this morning, having shouted outside the door till I had to fetch cotton wool. And its down in ruins my house; my wings broken; & I left on the bare ground. Odd, very odd, how violent this has become. I dread even going back to London. True, Iâ€™m in the crisis, & if this last chapter spoils, the book spoils. But what cares Karin! Thats the rub. She slightly chortles to plant us with some of her burdens & makes off well pleased at having got her way. Didnâ€™t I years ago record in one of these very volumes that sheâ€™d get what can be got by asking, nothing more? It is a case of spiritual deafness: she hears nothing of peoples thoughts; that is why she is, as she says unhappy; & its an affliction, not her fault; certainly our misfortune. Here I am with my wrecked weekâ€”for how serene & lovely like a Lapland night was our last week togetherâ€”feeling that I ought to go in & be a good auntâ€”wh. Iâ€™m not by nature: ought to ask Daisy what she wants; & by rights I fill these moments full of Mrs Dallowayâ€™s party for tomorrows writing. The only solution is to stay on alone over Thursday, & try my luck. A bad night (K.â€™s doing again) may partly account. But how entirely I live in my imagination; how completely depend upon spurts of thought, coming as I walk, as I sit; things churning up in my mind & so making a perpetual pageant, which is to me my happiness. This brew cant sort with nondescript people. These wails must now have ending, partly because I cannot see, & my hand shakes, having carried my bag from Lewes, where I sat on the castle top, where an old man was brushing leaves, & told me how to cure Lumbago; you tie a skein of silk round you; the silk costs 3 pence. I saw British canoes, & the oldest plough in Sussex 1750 found at Rodmell, & a suit of armour said to have been worn at Seringapatam. All this I should like to write about, I think.

And of course children are wonderful & charming creatures. Iâ€™ve had Ann in talking about the white seal, & wanting me to read to her. And how Karin manages to be so aloof I canâ€™t think. Thereâ€™s a quality in their minds to me very adorable: to be alone with them, & see them day to day would be an extraordinary experience. They have what no grown up hasâ€”that directnessâ€”chatter, chatter chatter, on Ann goes, in a kind of world of her own, with its seals & dogs; happy because sheâ€™s going to have cocoa tonight, & go blackberrying tomorrow: the walls of her mind all hung round with such bright vivid things, & she doesnâ€™t see what we see. But Iâ€™m forgetting Marjorie & only scribble till, as I hope in 15 minutes, the gate goes & L. comes. We have lost Â£100 a year, & he need no longer attend the officeâ€”a great gain. Now I hope for his book. I also begin to cherish dreams of retiring to a lovely house in the country, & there writingâ€”once we get the press on its feet, & Dadie attendant. This recalls Marjorie. I thought her flimsy & cheap in 1917, enough, at first, with this harping on the niceness or nastiness of young men, which becomes so dreary. Then she said, Iâ€™ve left Cyril. The upshot of the affair is that we have to engage her as sec. at Â£3 a week. She depends absolutely on that. Then where is she to live? in Bloomsbury, with a girlâ€”Its all chaotic & precipitous, & like a modern novel; but I suppose she will marry Tom Marshall.
