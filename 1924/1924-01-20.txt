### Sunday 20 January

â€”â€”the clock striking six, & Lord Berners, Siegfried Sassoon & William the chauffeur just gone. Yes, we have got into the peerage. Do I altogether like the peerage? The trouble is that thereâ€™s something a little opaque; they tell good stories; & Iâ€™ve rather lost the art of listening to their points. This Lord is as Siegfried says, a Kilburn Jew; round, fat, paleâ€”no fairly chubby, a determined little man, whose rank, I fancy, gives him some consistency not otherwise his. Still, rank, nowadays, at my age, is slightly vulgar, like a fringe to the mantelpiece. Vita dined here with him; & with her too rank is a velvet fringe; theres something dense instead of vibrant. Old S.S. is a nice dear kind sensitive warmhearted good fellow. He came back, with William waiting, half shut the door, & asked me to get reviewing for W.Â J. Turnerâ€”â€œhe hasnâ€™t asked this himself mind youâ€. (I dont like being in any way deflected from my comfortable ways, when it comes to writing. Thatâ€™s the worst of exciting society: it somehow makes one, momentarily, meretricious, in that department.) But to return. Siegfried is all right. Then what else has happened? No final news of Tavistock Square yet, but Saxonâ€™s cook has apparently taken Hogarth; & says the garden will be very nice for her little girl, & if Mrs Turner may bring the gas stove which was the Drs present, theyâ€™ll come in March. (The thing about aristocrats is that they veil all pretence very humbly; & let one ride on their backs; & then suddenly turn seignurial). Here we are, though, going through a time of waiting. I shall be happy so soon as my claws are into the move. At present, I feel Oh God another journey? Must I go up by train? Where am I to change before dinner tomorrow, & so on. Lottie vacillates. First she says sheâ€™s going to get Â£60 & be maid housekeeper to Kid Lewis; then sheâ€™ll stay with Saxonâ€”God knows whatâ€™ll be the end; & I shall be sorry to miss herâ€”Now, I must tackle my Montaigne quotations, since thats demanded by some Cockney in charge of the Supt.
