### Thursday 3 July

This is Dadieâ€™s second day. I looked out of my window, dressing, yesterday & saw him in grey with black bowler, Leonard, & Grizzle marching to the pillar box. Marjorie is ill, which is all to the good: business is brisk; I sat in the basement two days ago & took Â£5. Undoubtedly business is increasingâ€”all divine fun. But I have let Garsington languish like a decaying wreath on my pen. That was last Sunday. And, treading close on Garsington were the enamelled Lady Colefax, actually in this room, like a cheap bunch of artificial cherries, yet, loyal, hard, living on a burnished plate of facts: as for example Wembley: â€œa man who was in Canada tells meâ€ â€œI happened to know the Editor of the Daily Expressâ€™ all the time slightly trembling, in fear; inquisitive; not at all able to sink to the depths; but a superb skimmer of the surface; which is bright, I suppose, & foam tipped. I canâ€™t bring myself to despise this gull as I ought. But aristocrats, worldlings, for all their surface polish, are empty, slippery, coat the mind with sugar & butter, & make it slippery too. Solid Lord Berners, who might have been cleft from an oak knot, had to tell stories, could not endure silence, & much preferred laughter to thought: amiable characteristics, Clive says. To me, after a time, laborious & depressing. Good prim priggish bright eyed Peter F.Â L. Lucas is a cut above that. I met him at Cliveâ€™s, & he sliced English literature up very prettily, with a pocket knife. (Here Dadie came in & I had to make him tea; then we walked in the square in the rain; then called on the Stracheys, & I heard a good deal about Lord Lyttonâ€™s blue dressing gown from Lady Strachey.)
