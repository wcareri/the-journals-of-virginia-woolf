### Saturday 12 January

I have just introduced a great improvement in the cover of this bookâ€”a calendar. But to revert to those other improvementsâ€”shall I survive the process? Thereâ€™s a snag in the lease: some drastic clause saying that Bedford can refuse permission to sublet. If exercised, this would throw the offices, now let at Â£250, on our hands. But they offer us the flat & basement separate. All this involves calculation; & what is worse, a good deal of depression on L.â€™s side. Then I ask myself, why do I do it? Is it worth it? Arenâ€™t the risks too great? And I reply according to the mood Iâ€™m in. My heart turned like a wounded eel in my breast on Thursday night: it was serene as a summers day yesterday; now its sore and choppy. But I like myself for taking my fences. So long as rashness donâ€™t become silliness. Suppose it all fails, anyhow I shall have tried to bring it off. Then Nelly has agreed to stay on alone as a general; & I am to find Lottie a place in Gordon Square. I see difficulty upon difficulty ahead. None of this would much matter if L. were happy; but with him despondent or grim, the wind is taken out of my sails, & I say whatâ€™s it all for?

But the truth isâ€”no, I dont think I know the truth. Undoubtedly my chief prop is my writing, which cant fail me here or in London. But according to Montaigne, one is various. I cant lay down a law for my own feelings.

Its odd how entirely this house question absorbs one. It is a radical change, though. It means a revision of 4 lives. As for Lottie, I have my doubts, for her temper will always be unseating her, & I feel, after 7 years, or is it 8?, some responsibility for her. If by my doing she got into difficulty, I suppose I should blame myself. Yet for people of our age, which is in full summer, to dread risk & responsibility seems pusillanimous. We have no children to consider. My health is as good as it will be in this world, & a great deal better than it ever has been. The next ten years must see the press into fame or bankruptcy; to loiter on here is a handicap. But Iâ€™ve gone through all these matters time & time again, & wish I could think of something else. Iâ€™ve so much work on hand. Its odd how unimportant my work seems, suddenly, when a practical matter like this blocks the way. I see it as it appears to the world, from outside, not all cavernous & lit up as it appears from within.

Who have I seen? Saxon chiefly, & the Grants. They have a good deal of solid comfort at Grosvenor House Twickenham: chairs & tables & little mats on the dressing tables. There was a tight mute woman by the fire & Jim Rendel, playing chess with the old fluffy haired Majorâ€”that failure, that vivacious irresponsible old man, who lies on his sofa, a perfect gentleman, a man of the world, humorous, shrewd, practical, but ineffective utterly. In comes Ethel, & I perceive how lovely she was, & something charming still in their relationship, which is all worn away & staled; & she knows him, I suppose to be dying, & has her mind so set on practical affairs (theyâ€™re very poor) that she canâ€™t feel anything. She is a stately kind, unimaginative woman, who pities me a little, I think. (Now dont think of the house problem!)

Seeing Saxon dont amount to much, though I see him now a distinguished man. If I met him in a room full, I should say whoâ€™s that? I think. Its partly that heâ€™s become more sure of himself. And then, I fancy, reading Plato all through tells. I like his absence of detailâ€”in discussing plans, for instance; though when it comes to practice, heâ€™s a meticulous man, canâ€™t order a taxi for himself without endless deliberations.

I saw Adrian & Karin too. Thereâ€™s an unhappy woman if you like. But what is happiness? I define it to be a glow in the eye. Her eyes are like polished pavementsâ€”wet pavements. Thereâ€™s no firelit cavern within. Mollyâ€™s eyes are a different matter. For I went to tea with her, in a very clean house in Oakley Street. There was Michael, a young man, blushing, nervous, in trousers. He had been out to tea, but didnâ€™t like the people; they discuss such details, he said. â€œWhich part of Devonshire do you like best?â€ Its amusing to see how that sort of question appears in reality, before oneâ€™s used to it. Molly is very pale, very shapeless, like a walrus, rather; has cut a fringe, which is pure grey; & manages to dress much better than I do. I love the distracted busy ways of these mothersâ€”no parsimony of life, as there is with the childlessâ€”always something that must be decided, or done. Old Mrs MacCarthy is, I think, the most arrant & pernicious bore in the world; like a child, but not to be put down; insisting on her story being heard; utterly unable to see beyond her own plate of bread & butter; must know what kind of jam it is. Really I fancy these old ladies, without occupation, the most trying in the world. Two days ago she became a Roman Catholic. Charlie Sanger came in; patted Mollyâ€™s hand. He too respects maternal warmth. He has a great respect for the worth of human nature, it always strikes me; respects the upstanding qualities; knows how hard life isâ€”not, perhaps, how pleasant. One of these days I mean to write a story about life turning all the faces in a tube carriage grey, sodden, brave, disillusioned. But why doesnâ€™t it make any one of them look contented, happy, as if theyâ€™d got what they wanted? It gives a vivacity to the young, content to the elderly, very little intense pleasure, I shd. say, looking at them.
