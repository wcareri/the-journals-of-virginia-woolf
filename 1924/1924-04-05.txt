### Saturday 5 April

Well, I will make a brief beginningâ€”after 3 weeks silence. But it has not been silence at all. The noise of bus & taxi has worried me, & the noise of the human tongue has disturbed me, pleasantly & otherwise, & now Iâ€™m half asleep. Leonard working as usual.

Tonight, & one other, are the only nights Iâ€™ve been in this week; & all this afternoon went in talking to Mr Littell of the New Republic. But can I collect any first impressions? how Marchmont Street was like Paris; how my first night in the basement I saw the moon, with drifting clouds, & it was a terrifying & new London moon; dreadful & exciting; as if the Richmond moon had been veiled. Oh the convenience of this place! & the loveliness too. We walk home from theatres, through the entrails of London. Why do I love it so much? â€¦ for it is stony hearted, & callous. The tradespeople donâ€™t know oneâ€”but these disparaging remarks about the shopkeepers of Marchmont Street were interrupted & it is now Tuesday, April 15th, & L. & I have been having one of those melancholy middle aged summings up of a situation which occur from time to time, but are seldom recorded. Indeed most of life escapes, now I come to think of it: the texture of the ordinary day. We were to have had a quiet week, & I brought in Mortimer after Gerhardt last night, & he stayed & talked, aimlessly enough, about his money & his uncles; & so L. was desperately gloomy. Not a stroke of work done he says, since we came to London. This is largely imagination anticipating what people say must happen I think, though its true fish keep drifting into the net. Gerald Brenan back; Roger rampant to paint us; Morgan, elflike, mocking, aloof; Nessa & Duncan. Then there was Angelicaâ€™s accident which, for the psychology of it I should have described. Here was Nessa painting, & I answering the telephone. Positively bad news has to batter down optimism before it reaches oneâ€™s ears. Louie & Angelica have been knocked down by a motor & are in the Middlesex hospital. Having got that into my head, I had to repeat it to Nessa: to destroy all that simmering everyday comfort, with the smell of paint in the room, & Tom just coming up stairs to tea. She ran out & away from the telephone instinctively, ran round in an aimless way for a second. Then off they dashed & I after them, & so to the hospital, holding hands in the cab; & then sheer agony, for there was Louie, with her foot bandaged, & no Angelica; only an evasive nurse, parrying enquiries & taking us behind a screen where Angelica lay in bed, still, her face turned away. At last she moved. â€œSheâ€™s not deadâ€ Duncan said. They both thought her dead. Then the young Dr came, & seemed silently & considerately but firmly to wish the mother to know that the case was hopeless: very grave; run over across the stomach. Yes there may have to be an operation. The surgeon had been sent for, & was now on the train. So Nessa went back to sit there, & I saw again that extraordinary look of anguish, dumb, not complaining, which I saw in Greece, I think, when she was ill. The feelings of the people who donâ€™t talk express themselves thus. My feeling was â€œa pane of glass shelters me. Iâ€™m only allowed to look on at this.â€ at which I was half envious, half grieved. Moreover, I was sent off to find Clive, & so spared, or not allowed, the long wait there, in the chattering ward. Its a queer thing to come so close to agony as this, & just to be saved oneself. What I felt was, not sorrow or pity for Angelica, but that now Nessa would be an old woman; & this would be an indelible mark; & that death & tragedy had once more put down his paw, after letting us run a few paces. People never get over their early impressions of death I think. I always feel pursued. But theres an end of this. Nothing was wrong with Angelicaâ€”it was only a joke this time.

It takes a long time to form a habitâ€”the habit of living at 52 Tavistock Sqre is not quite formed, but doing well. Already I have spent a week without being bothered by noise. One ceases to hear or to see. The dominant interests, I suppose assert themselves, make order by triumphing over the lesser. I notice things much less than I did 10 days ago. Soon I shall be making a habit of life in this room.

As for work, I have done the Dr chapter in my novel: & am furbishing up the Greeks; the usual depressions assail me. My criticism seems to me pretty flimsy sometimes. But there is no principle, except to follow this whimsical brain implicitly, pare away the ill fitting, till I have the shape exact, & if thats no good, it is the fault of God, after all. It is He that has made us, not we ourselves. I like that text. I donâ€™t at all regret Richmond. Ethel Sands &c think I ought to mourn my beautiful room. But I now behold what is more beautifulâ€”the Russell Imperial Hotel in the evening sunshine; pink & yellow like the Brighton front. I regret Saturday afternoons a littleâ€”How I meander & drivel!

Marjorie Joad is on her holiday. I keep shop of a morning. Dadie has beenâ€”a sensitive vain youth, with considerable grit in him, I judge. Sometimes the future appears perilous; problematical rather, the press that is, but always fruitful & interesting. I have said nothing of my speech at the London Group, which drew tears; or of a host of matters. On Thursday we go to Rodmell, the test of poor Nellyâ€™s endurance. And now for the Elizabethans.

Grosvenor Sqre houses are precisely like saloons in Victorian Inns, or glorified boarding houses: handsome ill-proportioned rooms; gilt chairs, fretted tables; urns & vases depicted in pale mauve on the watered silk walls. Each wall has a pieceâ€”smugglers, coaching & so on; a little fire burns in a large grate; a glass screen fends it off, & there Nelly & Lord Bob perch, very chilly & formal, a dragoon bringing in little cakes.
