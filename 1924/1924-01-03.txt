### Thursday 3 January

This year is almost certainly bound to be the most eventful in the whole of our (recorded) career. Tomorrow I go up to London to look for houses; on Saturday I deliver sentence of death upon Nellie & Lottie; at Easter we leave Hogarth; in June Dadie comes to live with us; & our domestic establishment is entirely controlled by one woman, a vacuum cleaner, & electric stoves. Now how much of this is dream, & how much reality? I should like, very much, to turn to the last page of this virgin volume & there find my dreams true. It rests with me to substantiate them between now & then. I need not burden my entirely frivolous page with whys & wherefores, how we reached these decisions, so quick. It was partly a question of coal at Rodmell. Then Nelly presented her ultimatumâ€”poor creature, sheâ€™ll withdraw it, I know,â€”about the kitchen. â€œAnd I must have a new stove; & it must be on the floor so that we can warm our feet; & I must have a window in that wallâ€¦.â€ Must? Is must a word to be used to Princes? Such was our silent reflection as we received these commands, with Lottie skirmishing around with her own very unwise provisoes & excursions. â€œYou wonâ€™t get two girls to sleep in one room as we doâ€ &c. â€œMrs Bell says you canâ€™t get a drop of hot water in this houseâ€¦.â€ â€œSo you wont come here again, Nelly?â€ I asked. â€œNo, maâ€™am, I wont come here againâ€ in saying which she spoke, I think, the truth. Meanwhile, they are happy as turtles, in front of a roaring fire in their own clean kitchen, having attended the sales, & enjoyed all the cheap diversions of Richmond, which begin to pall on me. Already I feel ten years younger. Life settles round one, living here for 9 years as weâ€™ve done; merely to think of a change lets in the air. Youth is a matter of forging ahead. I see my contemporaries satisfied, outwardly; inwardly conscious of emptiness. Whats it for? they ask themselves now & then, when the new year comes, & canâ€™t possibly upset their comfort for a moment. I think of the innumerable tribe of Booth, for example; all lodged, nested, querulous, & believing firmly that theyâ€™ve been enjoined so to live by our father which is in heaven. Now my state is infinitely better. Here am I launching forth into vacancy. Weâ€™ve two young people depending on us. Weâ€™ve no house in prospect. All is possibility & doubt. How far can we make publishing pay? And can we give up the Nation? & could we find a house better than Monks House? Yes, thats cropped up, partly owing to the heaven sent address of Nelly. I turned into Thorntonâ€™s waiting for my train, & was told of an old house at Wilmingtonâ€”Iâ€™m pleased to find how volatile our temperaments still areâ€”& L. is steady as well, a triumph I canâ€™t say I achieveâ€”at the ages of 42 & 43â€”for 42 comes tripping towards me, the momentous year.

Now it is six, my boundary, & I must read Montaigne, & cut short those other reflections about, I think, reading & writing which were to fill up the page. I ought to describe the walk from Charleston too; but canâ€™t defraud Montaigne any longer. He gets better & better, & so I cant scamp him, & rush into writing, & earn my 20 guineas as I hope. Did I record a tribute from Gosse: that Iâ€™m a nonentity, a scratch from Hudson, that the V.O. is rotten; & a compliment all the way from America from Rebecca West? Oh dear, oh dear, no boasting, aloud, in 1924. I didnâ€™t boast at Charleston.
