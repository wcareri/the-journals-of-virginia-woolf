### Sunday 3 February

I didnâ€™t write however, because L. started the flu, the very next day, & gave me an unpleasant day; but thereâ€™s an odd pleasure too, purely feminine I suppose, in â€˜looking afterâ€™ being wanted; giving up my pen, & sitting with an invalid. But he was up in 4 days or less; & here we are, on the rails again, a very lovely spring day, which, by Heavenâ€™s grace, we have spent alone. No servants at the moment; no callers. The sun laid gold leaf over the trees & chimneys today. The willows on the bank wereâ€”what word is it?â€”soft yellow plumy, like a cloud; like an infinitely fine spray; something showery in it; & also grains of gold. I canâ€™t find the exact word; but reflect that I shant be walking here again next spring. I am not sentimental about it: Tavistock Square with the pale tower is more beautiful I think, let alone the adorable omnibuses.

Owing to the influenza, I donâ€™t think I have seen more than a handful; went to Ethel Sands's, was congratulated on Montaigne by Logan; Roger had stuck in it, though; talked to Arnold Bennett, a lovable sea lion, with chocolate eyes, drooping lids, & a protruding tusk. He has an odd accent; a queer manner; is provincial; very much a character; â€œI dont understand womenâ€”â€ This said as a schoolboy might say it. Everyone laughs. Then â€œNo woman is as sensitive as I amâ€”no woman could beâ€¦.â€ I suspect he minds things, even my pinpricks. He is slow, kind, affectionate, hauls himself along a sofa. But there was Logan, launching questions at my head; balls one had to return. Roger came in, rather wild eyed & staring. Prince Bibesco, & a Princess, who, said Roger, made the rest of us appear provincial. What a cosmopolitan he isâ€”how he dreads the British Parish; how he adores Paris. â€œShe had lived in Parisâ€ he said of this Princess: â€œSo of course she cd. talk at once about interesting things.â€ But I did not stay to hear them.

Yesterday, the parochial Turners came to measure the alcoves, & ask me whether Mrs Turnerâ€™s fatherâ€™s bureau could stand in the studyâ€”You must remember the piano, & the pianola case, said Edith, one of those worrying vague â€˜bodiesâ€™, who compose the middle classes; wearisome women, machine made, but all bristling with their views; they get hot & cold, peevish & fluttered, like other people; more so indeed; but I canâ€™t see why nature provides them, unless to supply Dartmouth with cadets, & colonels with wives. Nelly went to the flat with me, & next day wrote out a time table, to show that by 3 p.m. she would still have to wash up luncheon & do Leonardâ€™s boots. Very well, I said, find a place with Lottie. But the end of a weeks consideration is, apparently, that Lottie goes with the Turners, & Nelly clings to us. The money is paid over, & the house presumably ours tomorrow. So I shall have a room of my own to sit down in, after almost 10 years, in London. I must now write to Logan, to ask for a book for the press, & then read Elizabethan for my next chapter. At any rate the reading for this blessed book is a great source of delight to me.
