### Wednesday 23 January

And on Monday if Iâ€™d written here I should have had to say â€œWe have lost Tavistock Squareâ€â€”lost it through the sharp practice of Mr Simon, & the easy going indolence of Mr Guy Hemsley. It was a very unpleasant shock, & for my part I donâ€™t think we could easily have got over itâ€”found as good a house that is, let alone the infinite dreariness of the hunt. Anyhow, after sitting fidgetting at the play (Munroâ€™s Progress) & damning it considerably I went off to Coade, found myself expected, heard a very queer storyâ€”how Simon would let the Woolves have it if Coade would take Â£30 instead of Â£40: which Coade wouldnt; so I offered the extra Â£10; communicated with my solicitors by phone, across the office table (oh yes Iâ€™m grown up now) & had the matter arranged in 15 minutes, & went on to tea with Nessa swelling with pride & excitementâ€”all great nonsense, L. would say. But my house finding genius was outraged; whats the good of me, it asked, if you let these sharpers trick you? And I warn you, 52 is your house. So, practically not only spiritually speaking it now is; for in spite of Hemsley & the strike & the failure of the draft contract to arrive, &c &c; I visited the office with cheque & signature before one today; & then spent a shilling on a plate of beef. Ah well! Now I can sigh contented over my fire, in spite of the rain, & the strike, & Lady Colefax & Ethel Sands, & all cares & sorrows & perplexities. They arenâ€™t very grievous at the moment. The New Republic has taken my article on Jane Austen; Â£22 from the Dial for Lives of Obscure; &c &c. This time last year we were in a very different pair of shoes. Not that even then I was more than surface ruffled. No: I remember some very black, stagnant days about this time of year.

I have seen Roger; seen his pictures, which with the irrepressible vanity of the artist, he makes even the blind like me report on, by electric light, in a hurry. But enough of that; in every other way he abounds: cut him, wherever you like, & the juice wells up. Pamela is about to bear; so was his cat. Lytton has bought his house. Nessa is convicted by the law of not owning her flat at 50. Iâ€™ve said nothing of this great affairâ€”the battle of Bells & Stephens. Clive will be turned out & the Americans will triumph. And this reminds me that Iâ€™m resolved to draw in my horns with Mary H. I was absurdly exacerbated by a laughing report of Rogerâ€™s that Clive is circulating an account of me, wishing to dress like Lady Diana &c. Mary will cheerfully roast me to make Clive smile; & I think she relishes a little vinegar in my wounds. But Iâ€™m not proud of my own behaviour eitherâ€”except that I like being natural, & talking nonsense if Iâ€™ve a mind. This one cant do safely with her, & the excitability of my temper is such that when a light flick of the whip, like Rogerâ€™s is given me, I lose moreâ€”much moreâ€”than all the pleasure I get from talking like a genius over my fire to poor dear Maryâ€”whom I like too. But it canâ€™t be helped. And in London I shall have too many Maryâ€™s, & canâ€™t face the fritter to my nerves of the old intriguing ways.

Now Iâ€™m sending off Montaigne, & back again tomorrow to The Hours, which I was looking at disconsolatelyâ€”oh the cold raw edges of oneâ€™s relinquished pagesâ€”when the House business started this morning. But now I am going to write till we moveâ€”6 weeks straight ahead. I think its the design thatâ€™s good this timeâ€”God knows.

A letter from Morgan today saying â€œTo whom first but you & Virginia should I tell the fact that Iâ€™ve put the last words to my novel?â€ He is moved, as I am always on these occasions.
