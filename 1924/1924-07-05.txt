### Saturday 5 July

Just back, not from the 1917 Club; but from Knole, where indeed I was invited to lunch alone with his Lordship. His lordship lives in the kernel of a vast nut. You perambulate miles of galleries; skip endless treasuresâ€”chairs that Shakespeare might have sat onâ€”tapestries, pictures, floors made of the halves of oaks; & penetrate at length to a round shiny table with a cover laid for one. A dozen glasses form a circle each with a red rose in it. What can one human being do to decorate itself in such a setting? One feels that one ought to be an elephant able to consume flocks & be hung about with whole blossoming treesâ€”whereas one solitary peer sits lunching by himself in the centre, with his napkin folded into the shape of a lotus flower. Obviously, I did not keep my human values & my aesthetic values distinct. Knole is a conglomeration of buildings half as big as Cambridge I daresay; if you stuck Trinity Clare & Kingâ€™s together you might approximate. But the extremities & indeed the inward parts are gone dead. Ropes fence off half the rooms; the chairs & the pictures look preserved; life has left them. Not for a hundred years have the retainers sat down to dinner in the great hall. Then there is Mary Stuartâ€™s altar, where she prayed before execution. â€œAn ancestor of ours took her the death warrantâ€ said Vita. All these ancestors & centuries, & silver & gold, have bred a perfect body. She is stag like, or race horse like, save for the face, which pouts, & has no very sharp brain. But as a body hers is perfection. So many rare & curious objects hit oneâ€™s brain like pellets which perhaps may unfold later. I cut no very intelligent sight seer beside Geoffrey Scott,â€”There was Lady Gerald Wellesley, & we motored down through Kent, which Vita loves; all very free & easy, supple jointed as the aristocrat is; no inhibitions, no false reserves; anything can be said; but as usual, that fatal simplicity or rigidity of mind which makes it seem all a little unshaded, & empty. More mind, my Godâ€” (Iâ€™m too jangled even to quote correctly). As a setting & preparation I always feel this, or Ottolineâ€™s, or any aristocratâ€™s that I know, to be perfection. But one waits, & nothing happens. Not but what Harold Nicolson, sitting on the iron bar before the great burning logs, gently butting the tassel from the baldaquin, or whatever its called, with his forehead, wasnâ€™t trusty & honest & vigorous. He wore a blue velvet jacket. I liked him better than the suaver & suppler Geoffrey. I rather suspect Geoffrey suspected me; smelt me to be of his herd, & not the aristocrats, & caught himself winking at me, like a couple of ragamuffins, & did not like to be reminded of his ragamuffin days. He referred bitterly to Florence & Berensons & that awful society. But its the breeding of Vitaâ€™s that I took away with me as an impression, carrying her & Knole in my eye as I travelled up with the lower middle classes, through slums. There is Knole, capable of housing all the desperate poor of Judd Street, & with only that one solitary earl in the kernel.

Marjorie has pneumonia; & we are likely to be worked off our feet. MSS pour in; & this press becomes a serious business.
