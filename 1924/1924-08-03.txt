### Sunday 3 August

Now its already going, my silver mist, & I donâ€™t quite recognise myself of yesterday. L. has been telling me about Germany, & reparations, how money is paid. Lord what a weak brain I haveâ€”like an unused muscle. He talks; & the facts come in, & I canâ€™t deal with them. But by dint of very painful brain exercises, perhaps I understand a little more than Nelly of the International situation. And L. understands it allâ€”picks up all these points out of the daily paper absolutely instantly, has them connected, ready to produce. Sometimes I think my brain & his are of different orders. Were it not for my flash of imagination, & this turn for books, I should be a very ordinary woman. No faculty of mine is really very strong.

But its a question of work. I am already a good deal pulled together by sticking at my books: my 250 words of fiction first, & then a systematic beginning, I daresay the 80th, upon the Common Reader, who might be finished in a flash I think, did I see the chance to flash & have done with it. But thereâ€™s a lot of work in these things. It strikes me, I must now read Pilgrimâ€™s Progress: Mrs Hutchinson. And should I demolish Richardson? whom Iâ€™ve never read. Yes, Iâ€™ll run through the rain into the house & see if Clarissa is there. But thats a block out of my day, a long long novel. Then I must read the Medea. I must read a little translated Plato.
