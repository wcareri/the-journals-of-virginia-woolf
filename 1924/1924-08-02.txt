### Saturday 2 August

Here we are at Rodmell, & I with 20 minutes to fill in before dinner. A feeling of depression is on me, as if we were old & near the end of all things. It must be the change from London & incessant occupation. Then, being at a low ebb with my bookâ€”the death of Septimus,â€”I begin to count myself a failure. Now the point of the Press is that it entirely prevents brooding, & gives me something solid to fall back on. Anyhow, if I canâ€™t write, I can make other people write: I can build up a business. The country is like a convent. The soul swims to the top. Julian has just been & gone, a tall young man, who, inveterately believing myself to be young as I do, seems to me like a younger brother: anyhow we sit & chatter, as easily as can be. Its all so much the sameâ€”his school continues Thobyâ€™s school. He tells me about boys & masters as Thoby used to. It interests me just in the same way. Heâ€™s a sensitive, very quick witted, rather combative boy; full of Wells, & discoveries, & the future of the world. And, being of my own blood, easily understoodâ€”going to be very tall, & go to the Bar, I daresay. Nevertheless, in spite of the grumbling with which this began, honestly I donâ€™t feel old; & its a question of getting up my steam again in writing. If only I could get into my vein & work it thoroughly deeply easily, instead of hacking out this miserable 200 words a day, And then, as the manuscript grows, I have the old fear of it. I shall read it & find it pale. I shall prove the truth of Murryâ€™s saying, that thereâ€™s no way of going on after Jacobâ€™s Room. Yet if this book proves anything, it proves that I can only write along those lines, & shall never desert them, but explore further & further, & shall, heaven be praised, never bore myself an instant. But this slight depressionâ€”what is it? I think I could cure it by crossing the channel, & writing nothing for a week. I want to see something going on busily without help from me: a French market town for example. Indeed, have I the energy, Iâ€™ll cross to Dieppe; or compromise by exploring Sussex on a motor bus. August ought to be hot. Deluges descend. We sheltered under a haystack today. But oh the delicacy & complexity of the soulâ€”for, havenâ€™t I begun to tap her & listen to her breathing after all? A change of house makes me oscillate for days. And thats life; thats wholesome. Never to quiver is the lot of Mr Allinson, Mrs Hawkesford, & Jack Squire. In two or three days, acclimatised, started, reading & writing, no more of this will exist. And if we didnâ€™t live venturously, plucking the wild goat by the beard, & trembling over precipices, we should never be depressed, Iâ€™ve no doubt; but already should be faded, fatalistic & aged.
