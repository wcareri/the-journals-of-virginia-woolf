### Wednesday 9 January

At this very moment, or fifteen minutes ago, to be precise, I bought the ten years lease of 52 Tavistock Sqre London W.C.1â€”I like writing Tavistock. Subject of course to the lease, & to Providence, & to the unforeseen vagaries on the part of old Mrs Simons, the house is ours: & the basement, & the billiard room, with the rock garden on top, & the view of the square in front & the desolated buildings behind, & Southampton Row, & the whole of Londonâ€”London thou art a jewel of jewels, & jasper of jocunditieâ€”music, talk, friendship, city views, books, publishing, something central & inexplicable, all this is now within my reach, as it hasnâ€™t been since August 1913, when we left Cliffords Inn, for a series of catastrophes which very nearly ended my life, & would, Iâ€™m vain enough to think, have ruined Leonardâ€™s. So I ought to be grateful to Richmond & Hogarth, & indeed, whether its my invincible optimism or not, I am grateful. Nothing could have suited better all through those years when I was creeping about, like a rat struck on the head, & the aeroplanes were over London at night, & the streets dark, & no penny buns in the window. Moreover, nowhere else could we have started the Hogarth Press, whose very awkward beginning had rise in this very room, on this very green carpet. Here that strange offspring grew & throve; it ousted us from the dining room, which is now a dusty coffin; & crept all over the house.

And people have been here, thousands of them it seems to me. Iâ€™ve sat over this fire many an evening talking, & save for one fit of the glooms last summer, have never complained of Richmond, till I shed it, like a loose skin.

Iâ€™ve had some very curious visions in this room too, lying in bed, mad, & seeing the sunlight quivering like gold water, on the wall. Iâ€™ve heard the voices of the dead here. And felt, through it all, exquisitely happy.

Saxon is dining here tonight, & will be invited to move in with his troupe of lunatics at Easter. Our move can take place any time between Feb. 1st & then. Really, since I dont want to give auctioneers particulars, I may as well say briefly that my good genius for houses whispered in my ear on Monday, when, as I was leaving Mr Coade, the flushed young lady said â€œMrs Woolf, are you still looking for a house?â€ â€œThats what Iâ€™m here forâ€ I said. â€œBut Iâ€™d begun to think Iâ€™d better take a flat.â€ â€œOh well, 52 Tavistock Sqre might suit you. It has a large studio.â€ The perverse young man made me come to Gordon Sqre next, then misdirected me; & then I ran into Adrian; & then both together we went into Messrs Dollman & Pritchardâ€™s, through great green baize swing doors, up stairs, into a flat, now semi-dark; & then, down into the basement where I very rapidly lost count of rooms, & out into the old gentlemanâ€™s billiard room; & so decided this is our place if ever there was one.

Well, we had a long cold busy day yesterdayâ€”going, I did, twice to London, & ending with The Flame, a play which invented emotions which nobody has felt these 100 years; nobody felt even in 1824. But by a process of hypnotism, half Bayswater last night made themselves believe that other people felt like this & therefore that they ought to.

I may say that coincident with the purchase of 52 Tavistock Sqre (how I like writing that!) is the purchase of a nine penny pen, a fountain pen, which has an ordinary nib, & writesâ€”sometimes very well. Am I more excited by buying Tavistock Sqre, or by buying my new fountain pen?â€”which reflection reminds me that I have volume 7 of Montaigne to polish off, & Saxon dining here. So in spite of a clouded brain, upstairs, fetch the books, & begin. First, though, one gaze into the fireâ€”& oh dear, Iâ€™ve forgotten my ultimatum to the poor domestics. Both to go; & both very game, & also affectionateâ€”a trying combination.
