### Monday 15 September

Here I am waiting for L. to come back from London, & at this hour, having been wounded last year when he was late, I always feel the old wound twingeing. He has been seeing Nancy Cunard, so I expect a fair gossip. Vita was here for Sunday, gliding down the village in her large new blue Austin car, which she manages consummately. She was dressed in ringed yellow jersey, & large hat, & had a dressing case all full of silver & night gowns wrapped in tissue. Nelly said â€œIf only she werenâ€™t an honourable!â€ & couldnâ€™t take her hot water. But I like her being honourable, & she is it; a perfect lady, with all the dash & courage of the aristocracy, & less of its childishness than I expected. She left with us a story which really interests me rather. I see my own face in it, its true. But she has shed the old verbiage, & come to terms with some sort of glimmer of art; so I think; & indeed, I rather marvel at her skill, & sensibility; for is she not mother, wife, great lady, hostess, as well as scribbling? How little I do of all that: my brain would never let me milk it to the tune of 20,000 words in a fortnight, & so I must lack some central vigour, I imagine. Here I am, peering across Vita at my blessed Mrs Dalloway; & canâ€™t stop, of a night, thinking of the next scene, & how Iâ€™m to wind up. Vita, to attempt a return, is like an over ripe grape in features, moustached, pouting, will be a little heavy; meanwhile, she strides on fine legs, in a well cut skirt, & though embarrassing at breakfast, has a manly good sense & simplicity about her which both L. & I find satisfactory. Oh yes, I like her; could tack her on to my equipage for all time; & suppose if life allowed, this might be a friendship of a sort. The clock strikes 7, & I wonder if I hear Leonard, above the grey wild wind, talking to Nelly in the kitchen. Grizzle pricks a ear; lies flat again. He works & works. Here has the postman been, making me choke a little, born sentimentalist that I am, by hoping so honestly & sincerely that Mr Woolf would address the ILP at Lewes on the League of Nations? This sort of thing counts: Does Murry, the professor of the soul, talk to postmen about the League of Nations? I like their trust & admiration; & the swing from Knole & Lord Sackvilleâ€™s invitation (Jâ€™s R his favourite novel) to postmen getting up the local meetings, which suddenly seem to me, matters of the highest importance. All this confirms me in thinking that weâ€™re splinters & mosaics; not, as they used to hold, immaculate, monolithic, consistent wholes. How I scribble; & what use will this be for my great memoir writing age?

With Vita we discussed the murder of Mr Joshua, Ottoline, literature. Then she took us to Charlestonâ€”& how oneâ€™s world spins roundâ€”it looked all very grey & shabby & loosely cut in the light of her presence. As for Monks House, it became a ruined barn, & we picknicking in the rubbish heap. And then I regained my zest for life about an hour later. Now to the house, waiting for L.
