### Wednesday 12 March

And Iâ€™m now going to write the very last pages ever to be written at Hogarth House. First; the state of the weather. Its as if a fine veil had descended & lay, clear, over the chimneys; which are a pale yellow, & brick red. The veil clouds to the horizon, & I do not see the pagoda or the trees of Kew. My head is stuffy & heavy. Last night we dined at Blundenâ€™s farewell party, 35 covers laid, 6 or 7 speeches made, I between honest claret coloured soapy Wright, & the nice, but melodramatic looking Lynd. My little drama however was provided by Murryâ€”Lyndâ€™s neighbourâ€”who shook hands, about the fish course, warmly. Then, as people were going, came & sat beside me. This he volunteered: I asked him to come & lay his case before me at Tavistock. â€œWeâ€™re enemiesâ€ â€œNot enemies. Weâ€™re in different camps. But Iâ€™ve never said a word against you, Virginia.â€ â€œNor I against you. But what is wrong with us?â€ â€œYou begin out thereâ€”â€ spreading his hands. â€œWe make patterns of pretty words?â€ â€œNo. But you wonâ€™t begin with your instincts. You wonâ€™t own them. With all your exquisite sensibilitiesâ€”youâ€™re content to stay at that.â€ Here we came into a swift confused wrangle about â€œwriting wellâ€. I said one must throw every ounce of oneself into expression; & that the instinctive writers scamped their work. â€œI donâ€™t scamp my workâ€ said Murry. â€œYou say that only men who write well can say what they mean. My God Virginiaâ€”â€ but here L. came up, & Murry who was beginning on Jacobâ€™s Room switched off to L.â€™s article on Moore. Thats typical: you dont go down to the root of things. Moore ought to have been smacked on the bottom for talking about Hardy as he did. That disgraceful sentence about Hardy wanting a place by Aeschylusâ€”as if Hardy thought of any place except one by Rhoda Broughtonâ€”L. defended: said we must go. But I shant meet Murry for 10 years, & I want to finish the argumentâ€”Shall I come to the Adelphi? â€œDo.â€ â€œNot unless youâ€™ll come to see meâ€”I shall stand on my rightsâ€”â€ If you put it like that I will, he said, ferociously (yet so oleaginously, with a rolling lustful, or somehow leering, eye, so that I kept thinking how heâ€™d come down in the world, spiritually, what tenthrate shillyshallying humbugs he must live among.) And we said goodbye for ten years. He liked me, he said; he had always liked me, & enjoyed meeting me like this. Off we went. How honest & trusty & sterling Francis Birrell was in comparison!

So home that long cold exhausting journey for the last time. Some odds & ends of ideas came to me at the dinner. For one thing, how pungent peopleâ€™s writing is compared with peopleâ€™s flesh. We were all toothless insignificant amiable nonentitiesâ€”we distinguished writersâ€”Not a fig would I give for anyoneâ€™s praise or curse. Jack Squire, fat, & consequential; Eddie Marsh grown grey & fatherly; Nevinson beetroot coloured, & a little praising blood, & by inference himself; Tomlinson like the hard knob of a walking stick carved by a boy of 8; Blunden, despairing, drooping, crow-like, rather than Keatsâ€™ like. And did we really all believe in Blundenâ€™s â€˜geniusâ€™ Had we read his poems? How much sincerity was there in the whole thing? The truth is these collective gatherings must be floated by some conventional song, in which all can join, like Heâ€™s a jolly good fellow, which Squire started. Subtler impressions did occur to me, but I cant place them at the moment. Nor at the moment can I think of any farewell for this beautiful & lovable house, which has done us such a good turn for almost precisely nine years, so that, as I lay in bed last night, I nearly humanised it, & offered it my thanks. Old Mrs Turner will lie in my room now, & die there, it is predicted in two years time, among her china, her linen, & her great flowering wall papers, her fatherâ€™s bureau, & several enormous wardrobes.
