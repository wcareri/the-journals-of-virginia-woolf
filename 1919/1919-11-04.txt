### Tuesday 4 November

And now I only steal time from an hour dedicated to Stokoeâ€™s poems before Miss Green arrives & we plod off in the foggy cold to address the Guild upon the Russian revolution. The hard scrubbed surface of the lower middle class mind, does not attract me. This refers partly to Mr Osborne. Iâ€™m critical, intellectually, of the aristocrats but sensually they charm. I was hauled out of the background to talk to Katie at the Richmondâ€™s concert on Sunday. Her beautiful blue eyes all bleared & blood shot now, her skin soft like the skin on an old apple; like an appleâ€™s creased at the edge of the mouth, baggy here & there. What sorrow she has had to make her look sad I donâ€™t know. The following dialogue went forward.

K. The Cecils have given up their houseâ€”couldnâ€™t afford itâ€”  
V. But he has Â£5,000 a year!  
K. No such thing; besides everyone must economise. My dear Virginia, â€˜the end is coming. A la lanterne!â€™  
V. For you I daresay; not for me.  
K. Ah, thereâ€™s where you mistake. I go first, but you directly after.  
V. Well, after 300 years of Longleat, you deserve it.  
K. It was so beautifulâ€”you donâ€™t know how beautiful.  
V. You rode?  
K. I walked in the woods. We had music. I used to read; & always beautiful things to look at; always something new, never the same things twice over. I had it for 13 years; & I used to say I wished I could die when it was over: I wish I had.  
V. But you havenâ€™t done so badly.  
K. I didnâ€™t care for Egypt. I dont care for that sort of thingâ€”2 men running before my carriage. I envied themâ€”the only people who got any exercise. Civilisation is at an end. My father always warned us. Iâ€™ve read history. Weâ€™re all going to go. Painters will be the only people wantedâ€”to paint bodies pretty patterns. No one means to work. Thereâ€™ll be no clothesâ€”

So we talked in the intervals of Mozart.

This is the daily talk in Mayfair I suppose. She seemed to be convinced of it; almost grown indifferent; her one desire to save something for her son, & to die before the crash. But spoken with a kind of humorous resignation which foretells a gallant death on the scaffold.
