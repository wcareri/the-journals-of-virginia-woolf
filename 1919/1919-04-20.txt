### Sunday (Easter) 20 April

We are, for the first time for many years, spending Easter in London. We had arranged to go, but dissolved all our arrangements in 5 minutes; partly to escape what was said to be the worst journey on record; partly that L. may get 10 clear days, which will be possible at the end of the week. I own to some hopes of a wet Easter; but was disappointed. Both Friday & Saturday were of the texture of full summer. We walked along the river & through the park on Good Friday, & the sun made the crowd to swelter unpleasantly. They tramped placidly along, in their coats & skirts & bowler hats, leading their dogs, save for a random terrier who had secured a muzzle. Meanwhile the green of the leaves thrust at least one inch out of the envelopes, & today the tree against the window has some perfectly shaped small leaves, & the tree at the end of the garden is as green as it will be until September. On Saturday Bruce Richmond came in person to fetch my Defoe article; & we had a little talk about mistakes in proofs. He prides himself upon letting none through his fingers;â€”& charges such as do get through (& I was under the impression they were by no means rare) to Dalton. And then we walked; & I came out in my summer things, shady hat, thin muslin dress, stockings, & cloak on my arm. Today Iâ€™m sitting in a jersey & serge over the fire; but the evening repents, & through an open window the birds sing, & the leaves are yellow green in the sun. L. at Staines.

In the idleness which succeeds any long article, & Defoe is the 2nd leader this month, I got out this diary, & read as one always does read oneâ€™s own writing, with a kind of guilty intensity. I confess that the rough & random style of it, often so ungrammatical, & crying for a word altered, afflicted me somewhat. I am trying to tell whichever self it is that reads this hereafter that I can write very much better; & take no time over this; & forbid her to let the eye of man behold it. And now I may add my little compliment to the effect that it has a slapdash & vigour, & sometimes hits an unexpected bulls eye. But what is more to the point is my belief that the habit of writing thus for my own eye only is good practise. It loosens the ligaments. Never mind the misses & the stumbles. Going at such a pace as I do I must make the most direct & instant shots at my object, & thus have to lay hands on words, choose them, & shoot them with no more pause than is needed to put my pen in the ink. I believe that during the past year I can trace some increase of ease in my professional writing which I attribute to my casual half hours after tea. Moreover there looms ahead of me the shadow of some kind of form which a diary might attain to. I might in the course of time learn what it is that one can make of this loose, drifting material of life; finding another use for it than the use I put it to, so much more consciously & scrupulously, in fiction. What sort of diary should I like mine to be? Something loose knit, & yet not slovenly, so elastic that it will embrace any thing, solemn, slight or beautiful that comes into my mind. I should like it to resemble some deep old desk, or capacious hold-all, in which one flings a mass of odds & ends without looking them through. I should like to come back, after a year or two, & find that the collection had sorted itself & refined itself & coalesced, as such deposits so mysteriously do, into a mould, transparent enough to reflect the light of our life, & yet steady, tranquil composed with the aloofness of a work of art. The main requisite, I think on re-reading my old volumes, is not to play the part of censor, but to write as the mood comes or of anything whatever; since I was curious to find how I went for things put in haphazard, & found the significance to lie where I never saw it at the time. But looseness quickly becomes slovenly. A little effort is needed to face a character or an incident which needs to be recorded. Nor can one let the pen write without guidance; for fear of becoming slack & untidy like Vernon Lee. Her ligaments are too loose for my taste. But to return to life, albeit with something of an effort. I have forgotten to record Desmondâ€™s visit. His main purpose in coming was to get himself a bed; but I can pardon these self seeking impulses on the part of Desmond very easily. My tolerance in this respect is far greater than poor Mary Sheepshanksâ€™, who remarked bitterly that since she has gone to live at Golders Green her friends pay her visits on Sundays, for the sake of the country air. But then I am happy; & Mary S. is not; every virtue should be natural to the happy, since they are the millionaires of the race. I can give little account of Desmond, seeing that I was under contract to write all the morning, & he arrived late the night before. As L. had been kept by trains failing from reaching home till 8.45, he was out of tune for friendship. Desmond is a very sensitive man. He apologised, & did his best to charm; & did so, in both our cases, I think. But, sure enough, L.â€™s morning wasted in the sun of his laziness; for though he took a chair into the window & supplied himself with books, the books started ideas, & the ideas had to be communicated, & lying in my bath next door I heard fragments of Lord Robertâ€™s speech read from the Times; & then a disquisition upon the authenticity of Barbellionâ€™s diary; & this had gone on, with one excursion to buy an A.B.C. Railway Guide since breakfast. May we therefore be pardoned for inventing a cookâ€™s sister, who was spending the holidays with us; without this dear old Desmond would be smoking his cigarettes & talking about catching a train in the arm chair opposite at this moment. As it was, he had reluctantly to take himself off at lunch time, & fling himself upon a world of crowded trains, & accurate hours; directing his steps towards Oare where they have taken a house, which Molly is engaged upon getting into at this moment. Desmond declared that he had despatched a kitchen table to her; but I own that I doubt it. And who can say whether he has yet reached Oare?
