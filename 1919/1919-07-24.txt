### Thursday 24 July

Well, the peace at any rate is over; though the poor deluded servants are spending their day out on a bus to see the decorations. I was right: it is a servants peace. Last night we had Forster & the Bussys. It was not the mixture we should have chosen, since Forster would come out better alone. However, such are the penalties of owning a press. I feel something like Horace Walpole who had to limit the visitors to Strawberry Hill to 4 dailyâ€”Morgan is easily drowned even by the vivacity of the Bussys. He is an unwordly, transparent character, whimsical & detached, caring very little I should think what people say, & with a clear idea of what he wishes. I dont think he wishes to shine in intellectual society; certainly not in fashionable. He is fantastic & very sensitive; an attractive character to me, though from his very qualities it takes as long to know him as it used to take to put oneâ€™s gallipot over a humming bird moth. More truly, he resembles a vaguely rambling butterfly; since there is no intensity or rapidity about him. To dominate the talk would be odious to him. He subsided in a chair; or strolled about the room, turning over the pages of a book. Even when the Bâ€™s had gone, we made little direct headway. He will come to Asheham if we pay his fare. He has only Â£26 in the bank. I liked this simple way of explaining things. And he hates Stevenson; & makes up his novels as he goes along; & sees what I mean about dialogue; thereâ€™s a lot to say to him, though I donâ€™t yet know how to say it. Its absurd at my age, & I feel very middle aged, to be as easily put out & flustered as I am. It takes the form of saying things rashly. â€œI want to write an article upon youâ€ I said, & that wasnâ€™t what I meant to say.
