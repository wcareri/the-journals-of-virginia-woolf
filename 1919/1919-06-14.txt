### Saturday 14 June

The weather seems unbreakable. A delphinium is out today in the garden & one Sweet William; Lottie was discovered brushing the grass with a hearth broom, as though attending to the coat of some pet animal. They say the strawberry crop will be ruined. This is a serious matter for us as we have just bought 60 lbs. of sugar, & had arranged a great jam making. Strawberries are 2/ a lb. at this moment. Asparagus 6d & 7d, & yesterday at Rayâ€™s I ate my first green peas. I had a Hampstead field day; first the Murrys, then Adrian & Karin, & finally dinnerâ€”it was 8.30 by the time I got itâ€”with Ray & Dorothy Bussy. A very severe review of Murry, a severe review of Eliot, appeared in the Lit. Sup. on Thursday. Considering their general slackness, I donâ€™t see why they choose to come down so hard upon Murry; & I wish they hadnâ€™t. I attribute the extreme depression of him & Katherine at least partly to this. And I felt gorged & florid with my comparative success. Poor Murry pretended not to mind, but much like a small boy sticking it out that caning doesnâ€™t hurt. A poem is a very sensitive part to be beaten. But Katherine looks so ill & haggard that I suppose health may make a great part of her depression. She is going to San Remo for a year in September. Murry means to live alone in the country. I donâ€™t see how, all this being so, they can look forward to their future. And then thereâ€™s the question of Katherineâ€™s writing. Isnâ€™t she a little querulous & restless about that? Standing emphatically yet not quite firmly on her rights as an artist; as people do who must insist upon being one. In token of this she told me a long & to me rather distasteful story about her dealings with a man called Schiff, who wanted her to contribute to art & letters, & dared to offer her advice, upon which she got on her high horse, & wrote him such a letter that he replied humblyâ€”in a style that I couldnâ€™t make anything of, & indeed the rights & wrongs of the whole business escaped me though I protested, Iâ€™m ashamed to say, that I share Katherineâ€™s indignation. What a fraud one is in many ways! But then if oneâ€™s on this footing of being fellow artists & all that, oneâ€™s relations are queered from the start. Anyhow I went off rather sombre, leaving them to their spare lonely meal, nothing seeming to grow or flourish round them; leafless trees.
