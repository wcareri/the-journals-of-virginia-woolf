### Tuesday 10 June

I must use up the fifteen minutes before dinner in going on again, in order to make up the great gap. We are just in from the Club; from ordering a reprint of the Mark on the Wall at the Pelican Press; & from tea with James. His news is that Maynard in disgust at the peace terms has resigned, kicked the dust of office off him, & is now an academic figure at Cambridge. But I must really sing my own praises, since I left off at the point when we came back from Asheham to find the hall table stacked, littered, with orders for Kew Gardens. They strewed the sofa, & we opened them intermittently through dinner, & quarrelled, Iâ€™m sorry to say, because we were both excited, & opposite tides of excitement coursed in us, & they were blown to waves by the critical blast of Charleston. All these ordersâ€”150 about, from shops & private peopleâ€”come from a review in the Lit. Sup. presumably by Logan, in which as much praise was allowed me as I like to claim. And 10 days ago I was stoically facing complete failure! The pleasure of success was considerably damaged, first by our quarrel, & second, by the necessity of getting some 90 copies ready, cutting covers, printing tables, glueing backs, & finally despatching, which used up all spare time & some not spare till this moment. But how success showered during those days! Gratuitously, too, I had a letter from Macmillan in New York, so much impressed by The Voyage Out that they want to read Night & Day. I think the nerve of pleasure easily becomes numb. I like little sips; but the psychology of fame is worth considering at leisure. I fancy oneâ€™s friends take the bloom off. Lytton lunched here on Saturday with the Webbs, & when I told him my various triumphs, did I imagine a little shadeâ€”instantly dispelled, but not before my rosy fruit was out of the sun. Well, I treated his triumphs in much the same way. I canâ€™t feel gratified when he expatiates upon a copy of Eminent Victorians lined & initialled â€œMâ€ or â€œHâ€ by Mr & Mrs Asquith. Yet clearly the thought produced a comfortable glow in him. The luncheon was a success. We ate in the garden, & Lytton sported very gracefully & yet with more than his old assurance over the conversation. â€œBut Iâ€™m not interested in Irelandâ€”â€
