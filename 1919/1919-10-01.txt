### Wednesday 1 October

The strike remains, so far as we can judge, the same. On the other hand, rumours of the strike change from hour to hour. A post came this morning. The postman is reported to say that all trains are running as usual. The signalman appears. Situation unchanged; much depressed. Then Dedman comes to pick apples. A notice is in the post office, he says, that trains are as usual. Nelly goes to Lewes. Comes back â€˜frightenedâ€™ so she says. A few trains only, into which you get at your own risk. This sickened her of travel, which she had been urging an hour before. We went down to the signalman with books & offers of help. His wife met us; he being at Newhaven. A fiery, impulsive, vigorous woman about to bear her 5th child. She was urging him to give in. Public opinion was against them, she said. Then she explained that they had only saved 6 shillings. With their strike pay this canâ€™t long keep off hunger. Then she couldnâ€™t see the rights of it, â€œTheyâ€™re like children whoâ€™ve had their sweet & dont want to give up their pennyâ€ she said, often enough to show that sheâ€™d used the argument often to him. They must give it up sooner or later, so why not now.
