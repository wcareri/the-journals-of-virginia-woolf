### Saturday 1 November

Shall I ever again get time for writing here? Never have I been so pressed with reviewing, for theres George Eliot to fill up all crannies left by other books, & Murry to choke effectually any empty space remaining. I think I might slack off if N. & D. succeeds. No more letters or reviews. A cheque for Â£25 though, on copies sold before publication. Happily the book begins to recede from the front of my mind, & I begin to be a little surprised if people speak of it (not that anyone hasâ€”but meeting Mde Champcomunal yesterday, I was glad sheâ€™d not heard of it). This lady whose name I shall never write again, wishes to share Tregerthen: the plan may be the perfect one. She is a grenadier of a woman, high red cheek bones, thin, competent, handsome, unhappy, tailor made & up to date. I met her at Regent Squareâ€”all lights out; a single candle, electricians insistent. Sometimes I wish that the old laws of life held good: a husband, a house, servants, establishments. That same afternoon I looked in at the London Group; but saw nothing save people I had no wish to see; ran into Noel Olivier walking through the Squares. November descends. Squireâ€™s new monthly out; and nowâ€”Middlemarch!
