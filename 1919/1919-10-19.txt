### Sunday 19 October

A gap of more than a week. Let me see how my hours after tea have been occupied. The Waterlows came last Sunday; on Monday I went up, had my tea at the Club, & met for a second, Molly Hamilton â€œAnd whenâ€™s your novel coming out?â€; Tuesday I had to read through 2 volumes of an American scribbler sent me by Murry; Wednesday was crammed with George Eliot, I expect, since Logan & Clive came at 7.30; Thursday I rejoiced in Saxon & Barbara; Friday I had tea with Nessa, & supper too, & went to a Promenade; Saturday I heard L. say his lecture, & then had poor little Dorothy Hornett up to give her her sweets; so here I am with a clear conscience at Sunday, over my fire, waiting for L. to come in from Sutton. Clearly I cant go through the list. That is an unreasonable demand. Sydney Waterlow is very well pleased with himself. Yet as his talk becomes more & more complacent, his prospects more & more blooming, I always fancy that I can see a slight wobble in what should be the perfect sphere, like that which used to foretell the collapse of an air ball. He has great designs upon the F.O. nothing less than complete reformation; but if these miscarry he will accept Â£10,000 a year in the city. But the preposterous man has his endearing absurdity. A third project of his is to settle at Oare & write books in collaboration with Desmond. For ever he clings to the skirts of the Desmonds & Leonards & even Virginias (Iâ€™m much admired, momentarily) as if not wholly secure even now. She, Dawks, was squat & vivacious as usual. Some of her intelligent remarks fell flat thoughâ€”those supposing a knowledge of Sydneyâ€™s work. He is respectful to her in her own department, & feels that her capacity there is a tribute to him. Saxon & Barbara donâ€™t need much licking into shape: he on the sprightly side, she maternal & boyish, a little to my irritation. After all, few people dont act a part of some kind. Logan was rather more aloof & distinguished than my memory of him. Perhaps he disapproved a little of Clive. Clive certainly intended that he should. He described his entire indolence; & then his pleasures: â€œWe dine not very well, & then slip into bed together.â€ â€œGoodness noâ€”I dont read on a systemâ€”Goodness gracious, I dont write every day.â€â€”so on. Now Loganâ€™s epicurean life is well regulated; self improvement is not despicable in his eyes; his conversation is decorous. We got out 12 volumes of Gibbon, & they capped passages. We have undertaken to get Loganâ€™s stories printed.
