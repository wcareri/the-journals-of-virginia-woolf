### Thursday 30 January

Such is the cold today that I doubt whether I can go on with my disquisition. On such a day one would need to be of solid emerald or ruby to burn with any flame, & not merely dissolve in grey atoms in the universal grey. I saw no one in Richmond High Street who seemed to be burning with the intensity of ruby or emeraldâ€”poor pinched women, absolutely mastered by circumstances, though I did hear one speak of going home to get tea ready, which suggested the possibility of some individual life for her. A child threw her hat into the area which I had to recover, & made a whole row of them laugh by tossing it up twice so that it fell into the area again; then the Poles require copies of the Inâ ternational Râ eview to be sent to Paris; & here is Nelly to say two servants may call in to see me about Nessaâ€™s place. To my chronicle of Lytton I can only add that he writes today to put us off, being fled to Tidmarsh, since â€œCalvÃ© is ill, & cannot meet me at Heinemannâ€™sâ€. What he should be doing with CalvÃ©, I dont know; but the information thus vouchsafed, suggestsâ€”well, further speculations of mine upon fame, jealousy, vanity, & so forth which I wait a more congenial season to unfold. Owing to this incubus of my friends I have said nothing of a visit from Alix, from Norton, from Fredegond, nor traced some rather interesting revelations, or developments, which may bear fruit one of these days. Alix is thinking of taking a house in Gordon Sqre â€œchiefly in order to live with Jamesâ€ she said; & this, as she announced it to L., me, & Saxon, had some quality in it that for the moment made my blood run cold. Now, to tune myself up I am going to shut Mrs Watts upon George Frederic, & open the Antigone of Sophocles. One secondâ€”I must note for future use, the superb possibilities of Freshwater, for a comedy. Old Cameron dressed in a blue dressing gown & not going beyond his garden for 12 years, suddenly borrows his sonâ€™s coat, & walks down to the sea. Then they decide to proceed to Ceylon, taking their coffins with them, & the last sight of Aunt Julia is on board ship, presenting porters with large photographs of Sir Henry Taylor & the Madonna in default of small change.
