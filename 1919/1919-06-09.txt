### Monday 9 June (Whit-Monday)

I know I meant to convey my sense of the degradation of the Squireâ€™s party; but the sense has faded, & is not worth recapturing. A week at Asheham has intervenedâ€”from one Tuesday to another. An odd thing happened to me at Asheham, where I count upon becoming clearer & more concentrated, & reading print as if through a magnifying glass. The very opposite of this took place. I dozed & drowsed & seemed to feel the sun in my brain sending all my thoughts to seek repose in the shadow. I write there at an open window looking onto the field; & the field was gilt with buttercups; the sheep were tempting in their indolence; in short, I used to find the morning gone & only a few lines written, & so it was with my Addison, or whoever it might be, after tea. Our ship rode so steady that one came to disbelieve in motion or the possibility of change; we appeared wedged in the blue. Perhaps one day there was a cloud; but no harbourage was offered it, & congregation of clouds was impossible. The loveliness of Asheham once again brimmed the cup & overflowed. Wild ideas seized us of building a house at the Lay. To give up every foothold in that region seemed unthinkable. L. bicycled round & brought news of an ancient manor house at Denton, which excited hopes, but the sight of it next day completely dashed them. In order to popularise this large stuffy, ill lit, slightly mouldy & decayed mansion the owner, a London publican dazzled into purchasing by the aristocratic name but unable to induce his wife to live there, hit on the ambitious plan of starting a line of omnibuses to run from London, & deliver their loads at the manor house, where tea would be provided. One such feast was held, as long boards stretched on trestles, & a few dozen green wine-glasses testified; but the device failed; the Londoners had seen more seductive sights than Denton Manor, & it is still in the market. With the notion of building a house running strong in my mind I went to Charleston for a night & was there disabused of such fantasies very completely. To recapitulate a story told verbally several times would be dull. But Nessa & I quarrelled as nearly as we ever do quarrel now over the get up of Kew Gardens, both type & woodcuts; & she firmly refused to illustrate any more stories of mine under those conditions, & went so far as to doubt the value of the Hogarth Press altogether. An ordinary printer would do better in her opinion. This both stung & chilled me. Not that she was bitter or extreme; its her reason & control that give her blame its severity. Anyhow I left in rather a crumpled condition, & paused in Lewes, on L.â€™s advice, to see a house on the hill. A degree of that refinement & smug efficiency which one finds in Surrey houses set me against the White House; & I trudged down into Lewes again in no cheerful mood, with three hours, moreover, to spend there. To pass the time, more than anything, I asked Mrs Wycherley about houses; & she, after tepidly recommending some that were impossible & sketching the difficulties of the situation, bethought her of one newly on the market, small, old, actually in Lewes, & perhaps a little humble for one used to lodge at Asheham. I pricked my ears; since this is always the way one is told of what one wants. Off I went, up Pipes Passage, under the clock, & saw rising at the top of the sloping path a singular shaped roof, rising into a point, & spreading out in a circular petticoat all round it. Then things began to go a little quicker. An elderly and humble cottage woman the owner, showed me over. How far my satisfaction with the small rooms, & the view, & the ancient walls, & the wide sitting room, & the general oddity & character of the whole place were the result of finding something that would do, that one could conceive living in, that was cheap (freehold Â£300) I donâ€™t know; but as I inspected the rooms I became conscious of a rising desire to settle here; to have done with looking about; to take this place, & make it oneâ€™s permanent lodging. Perhaps later it will amuse me to read how I went from one grade to another of desire; till I felt physically hot & ardent, ready to surmount all obstacles. I liked the way the town dropped from the garden leaving us on a triangular island, vegetables one side, grass the other; the path encircling the round house amused me; nor are we overlooked. In short I took it there & then, being egged on by Wycherleyâ€™s hesitation, & hints of a purchaser who had already asked for the refusal. Lewes that afternoon, with its many trees & laburnums, & water meadows, & sunny bow windowed houses, & broad High Street looked very tempting & dignified. The end of the story, which I must curtail, is that we have bought the Round House, & are now secure of a lodging on earth so long as we need sleep or sit anywhere.
