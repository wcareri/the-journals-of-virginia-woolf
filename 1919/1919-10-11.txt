### Saturday 11 October

Things are once more in swing, though in rather a modified form for me, since Iâ€™ve promised to be careful, which means avoiding the temptation of London, & walking down the sunny drives at Kew. In spite of cold, the sun is still the sun of holiday & country, somehow unfit for the pavement slabs. A record autumn for fineness, I should think, always falsifying the predictions of the Times prophet, who is gloomy. For the first time I went up to London yesterday in the first place to buy gloves; in the second to have tea at Nessaâ€™s flat, A comfortable party there, seated on the kitchen floor. Julian in a Norfolk jacket & Eton collar looking a responsible Briton; Quentin still amorphous. The dim & dusky flat of Jamesâ€™s day is now at the very opposite pole of cultureâ€”the pole of sun & brightness. The rooms overflow with children. The books are the incongruous part of the decoration, & Nessa professed great contempt for them. â€œOf course, she said, thereâ€™s Shakespeare & all that on the bottom shelf, but look at that! Doesnâ€™t that give James away?â€ He has all the right books, neatly ranged, but not interesting in the leastâ€”not, I mean, all lusty & queer like a writers books. The Stracheys with the exception of Lytton are down in the world. Lytton we ran into at the Club on coming backâ€”composed, agreeable, permanently shone upon, & completely sure of himselfâ€”ah, but infinitely charming into the bargain. Success, I believe, produces a kind of modesty. It frees you from bothering about yourself. He was flattering to me, as usual; but then Iâ€™m not a success. Did I not hear from Macmillan today that Messrs Duckworthâ€™s charges are prohibitive? So my chance of appearing in America is gone. But Iâ€™m showered under with review books; &, though I dont suppose I can pretend that any saying by a publisher is a rebuff, still Iâ€™m conscious of being almost proofâ€”against Gordon Square? I wonder. Yes, I believe that my well of confidence, or rather pleasure, is so deep sunk as to bubble up in a day or two after any chastening. But this I shall soon be able to test. My review, laboured & well meaning as it was, of Hopeâ€™s book has so far drawn no letter of thanks from her. Iâ€™m not sure that she didnâ€™t cherish some boundless dream about it. A whole column, in the middle, comparing her with the greatest only. Well, Iâ€™ve had my dreams too. At the same time Iâ€™m generally rather surprised by the goodness of reality.
