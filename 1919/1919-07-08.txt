### Tuesday 8 July

We went on, however, L. to Asheham, & I to Charleston, where there was Maynard, & a good deal of brisk talk. He is disillusioned he says. No more does he believe, that is, in the stability of the things he likes. Eton is doomed; the governing classes, perhaps Cambridge too. These conclusions were forced on him by the dismal & degrading spectacle of the Peace Congress, where men played shamelessly, not for Europe, or even England, but for their own return to Parliament at the next election. They were not wholly vicious; they had spasms of well meaning; but a fate seemed to possess the business from the first, driving it all in the most fatal direction & soon no one had the strength to resist. He resigned, & is now a don at Cambridge, daily rejecting profitable offers made him by houses of business, willing, according to Duncan, to pay Â£4,000 a year for his attendance for a short time daily. We all came up to London early next day, Nessa having to see a Mr Cholmondeley about Julianâ€™s education. We had an afternoonâ€™s gaiety at the Ballet, & then went back to Gordon Sqre, everything a little glittering & unreal, as usual after the country & in Nessaâ€™s presence.

Friday, the 4th, I went to tea with Katherine, since I begin to feel my visits numbered, how seriously I dont know, but once she gets abroad, whatâ€™s to bring her back? Murry, poor man, pale & sad as usual, for she is again only just out of bed. The weather of course is taking its revenge now for a season of generosity. We have fires every night. Worse than the cold is the drab coloured sky, so that oneâ€™s whole existence seems to be in the shadow.

On Saturday we saw the horse show, & I had a look at Queen Alexandraâ€™s poor old effigy, still painted like a wildrose, though she is about 75, & can only hobble up a ladder like a decrepit washerwoman. Its only on the face that the pretence can be preserved.

On Sunday Mrs Hamilton brought her sisterâ€”â€œthe poetâ€â€”to dinner. I almost laughed at the sight of her. She stumps, peering & hesitating, into a room, shakes hands with emphasis, & displays a small round pale face, with wisps of brown hair controlled by a tight band of ribbon. A mixture of schoolgirl & German professor to look at; awkward & restless in manner; & delivering herself of rounded periods which would be queer enough in themselves were they not delivered with the oddest rotundity of diction, as of one speaking from a tub,â€”& in a voice that swells & falls but finally swells like a musical instrument imperfectly controlled. In spite of these curiosities of manner & appearance she seemed perfectly self possessed, & referred to her stock of book learning, which seemed very large & various, with the greatest composure. â€œAs Nietchze saysâ€ or, â€œTo quote Dostoevskyâ€, or â€œIn the opinion of the Neo-Cartesians.â€â€”Such were her conversational openings, waiting no season but obtruding themselves spontaneously. â€œI do not myself feel any doubt as to the nature of the good, nor have I indeed ever felt any doubt upon that pointâ€â€”this was fired off when the talk was not concerned with anything of the kind. Yet one couldnâ€™t dislike her, or dub her a very poisonous variety of the prig. I suppose her to be the family prodigy, fed on books, & living up to now in a dark cave until like a creature deprived of light the complexion of her soul is entirely white. She has the mind of an albino. What is to become of her? I donâ€™t suspect her a poet. I imagine her one of those prodigies who quite contentedly continue all their lives, in some country village, to absorb learning, & have their circle of correspondents. Her letters must be portentous. Molly watched her with the oddest mixture of pride & uneasiness. What were we thinking of her? Did we realise that these manners & views were only superficial; did we not see how remarkable a product she wasâ€”could we not perhaps be made, by artful questions & hints, to see it? Margot is now readingâ€”on Comparative Religions. Margot spent all her life pretending she was a Monk or Rob Roy. We now hesitate whether or not to ask to read her poems.
