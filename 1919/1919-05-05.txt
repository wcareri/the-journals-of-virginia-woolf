### Monday 5 May

The day mother died twenty something years ago. The smell of wreaths in the hall is always in the first flowers still; without remembering the day I was thinking of her, as I often do.â€”as good a memorial as one could wish.

Now it is a fine evening, the first since I wrote here last; & Iâ€™m just back from Asheham, Leonard still to come in. A fine but cloudy day; an immense weight of sun piled up behind the clouds. I race through, so as to have time for a bath. Ah but how happy weâ€™ve been at Asheham! It was a most melodious time. Everything went so freely;â€”but I cant analyse all the sources of my joyâ€”& hereâ€™s Leonard in, to find a stack of books from the New Statesman, & the drawing room floor littered with blue-black papers from Roger. Lottie & Nelly chattering away about their house cleaning.
