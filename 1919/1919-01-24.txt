### Friday 24 January

Oddly enough, the day after writing this sentence I got into touch with Lytton, after a lapse of six months or so, on the telephone. & he is to dine here next Friday. But to resume. There are three words knocking about in my brain to use of Stracheys,â€”a prosaic race, lacking magnanimity, shorn of atmosphere. As these words have occurred automatically, & will tease me till written down, I daresay there is some truth in them. All the unpleasantness that I wish to introduce into my portrait of Lytton is contained in them, as if in deep wells. I shall only need one drop of this gall for his portrait, but I fancy a tinge of the kind is perceptible in him tooâ€”far more in James, Oliver & Marjorie. Rogerâ€™s version is that all, except Lady S., lack generosity. It is an air, a vapour, an indescribable taste of dust in the throat, something tickling & irritating as well as tingling & stimulating. But then one must combine with this a great variety of mental gifts, & gifts of characterâ€”honesty, loyalty, intelligence of a spiritual order. One might almost attribute what I mean in Lyttonâ€™s case at least to lack of physical warmth, lack of creative power, a failure of vitality warning him not to be spendthrift but to eke out his gifts parsimoniously, & tacitly assume his right to a superior share of comfort & opulence. In matters of emotion this has a slightly stingy appearance, nor is he ever unthinkingly generous & magnanimous, risking himself. Mentally of course it produces that metallic & conventionally brilliant style which prevents his writing from reaching, to my judgment, the first rate. It lacks originality, & substance; it is brilliant, superbly brilliant journalism, a supremely skilful rendering of the the old tune. Written down these words are too emphatic & linear; one should see them tempered & combined with all those charming, subtle & brilliant qualities which compose his being in the flesh. But when I think of a Strachey, I think of someone infinitely cautious, elusive & unadventurous. To the common stock of our set they have added phrases, standards, & witticisms, but never any new departure; never an Omega, a Post Impressionist movement, nor even a country cottage, a Brunswick Square or a printing press. We Stephens, yes, & even Clive, with all his faults, had the initiative, & the vitality to conceive & carry our wishes into effect because we wished too strongly to be chilled by ridicule or checked by difficulty. Even in the matter of taking Tidmarsh Lytton had to be propelled from behind, & his way of life insofar as it is unconventional, is so by the desire & determination of Carrington.
