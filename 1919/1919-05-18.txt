### Sunday 18 May

Our seductive sweetness appears still to be drawing bees from all quarters; last night I went to bed with lips so parched with talking & brain so dazed that I could only tumble into sleep head foremost. As we left lunch & were on the stairs there was a great rapping at the door, & the hall immediately filled with strangers, who eventually became Roger, Pamela, & a strange silent foreign woman whom from her grey hair I took to be Marjorie Fry. We pitched on the grass, under a shower of apple blossom; & there sat until tea; & then Logan came; & we only fell silent at half past six or even later; nor was there a moment of repose, neither for tongue nor brain. It is true that Logan does his turns, which take the form of â€œdelightful adventuresâ€”life is like the Arabian Nightsâ€”â€ & good stories, quotations, & recitations; but even these required intelligent attention. He is a very well brushed, bright eyed, rosy cheeked man, seemingly entirely satisfied with life, which he appears to have mastered; visiting each of its flowers, like a bee. These flowers he keeps stored in his waistcoat pocket: lines from Jeremy Taylor, Carlyle, Lamb, &c. An epicurean, I suppose: a little frosty, I conjecture; though kindly & humane of course; rather than human. I believe his motive was to get us to print some new works of his; anyhow he welcomed the invitation to submit them; & he lavished offers of help, & suggestions for increasing our sales; & altogether took the Hogarth Press in hand, & promises us a most splendid future. He proposes to become our agent. One must beware of becoming satellites of his set, however; cherishing single lines, & reprinting the Essays of Elia.
