### Tuesday 18 February

Here I sit waiting for Alix, who canâ€™t be coming to disburden herself of confidences as I supposed; & thus my mind returns by way of her fickleness to my friends. Where was I? Desmond, & how I find him sympathetic compared with Stracheys. It is true; Iâ€™m not sure he hasnâ€™t the nicest nature of any of usâ€”the nature one would soonest have chosen for oneâ€™s own. I dont think that he possesses any faults as a friend, save that his friendship is so often sunk under a cloud of vagueness, a sort of drifting vapour composed of times & seasons separates us & effectively prevents us from meeting. Perhaps such indolence implies a slackness of fibre in his affections tooâ€”but I scarcely feel that. It arises rather from the consciousness which I find imaginative & attractive that things donâ€™t altogether matter. Somehow he is fundamentally sceptical. Yet which of us, after all, takes more trouble to do the sort of kindnesses that come his way? who is more tolerant, more appreciative, more understanding of human nature? It goes without saying that he is not an heroic character. He finds pleasure too pleasant, cushions too soft, dallying too seductive, & then, as I sometimes feel now, he has ceased to be ambitious. His â€˜great workâ€™ (it may be philosophy or biography now, & is certainly to be begun, after a series of long walks, this very spring) only takes shape appears, I believe, in that hour between tea & dinner, when so many things appear not merely possible but achieved. Comes the day light, & Desmond is contented to begin his article; & plies his pen with a half humorous half melancholy recognition that such is his appointed life. Yet it is true, & no one can deny it, that he has the floating elements of something brilliant, beautifulâ€”some book of stories, reflections, studies, scattered about in him, for they show themselves indisputably in his talk. Iâ€™m told he wants power; that these fragments never combine into an argument; that the disconnection of talk is kind to them; but in a book they would drift hopelessly apart. Consciousness of this, no doubt, led him in his one finished book, Remnants, to drudge & sweat until his fragments were clamped together in an indissoluble stodge. I can see myself, however, going through his desk one of these days, shaking out unfinished pages from between sheets of blotting paper, & deposits of old bills, & making up a small book of table talk, which shall appear as a proof to the younger generation that Desmond was the most gifted of us all. But why did he never do anything? they will ask.

At any rate in his own intermittent way Desmond is faithful. So much one may affirm of Saxon too, who comes next on my list. But Saxonâ€™s fidelity is almost that of the senile colly, or broken down assâ€”the pensioner who can draw upon a memory of the past for a seat at oneâ€™s table in perpetuity. His present condition makes him appear almost exclusively in the character of almoner. He has little to give at the moment, life has not been generous to him. His possessions are old friendships, old memoriesâ€”things weâ€™ve talked of ages ago. Unlike the rest of us he has had no renewal of life in marriage; his hopes in that direction have been crushed. Therefore he comes to me disconsolately, grudgingly, ungenerously were the cause not one beyond his reach, asking rather than giving; asking at this moment that I shall accept Barbara at his handâ€”return her to him enriched with the glow of my approval. And Barbara does not appear to me somehow of that metalâ€”that rarityâ€”However, poor Saxonâ€™s life is now in the uncomfortable & unbecoming season which is so painfully well reproduced out of doors. Sleet, & mud & chill, & nothing growing; no warmth, no brilliancy, not even a modest domestic glow. He lodges with Stagg in Great Ormond Street, & has summed up his own position accurately as that of one who finds himself lonely if alone, & bored if in company. But faithfulâ€”there is something worth having in Saxonâ€™s fidelity; something that makes his most meagre visitation not altogether fruitless. One is aware, even after two hours of tepid & almost entire silence, that he is strictly true, genuine, unalloyed. You would never find him wanting; never find him callous, insincere, or grudging the last farthing of his possessions. Granted that he is not richly supplied with the gifts one might need, still I come to think in my weary age that safetyâ€”a modest competenceâ€”a truth as flawless as diamond or crystalâ€”is not negligible, nor without its curious flashes of high remote beauty. At any rate I rest on the thought of Saxon with some relief after hovering for the past two months in a state of uncertainty over the thought of Katherine Murry. I might turn round what I have written of Saxon in order to make a background on which to paint a portrait of Katherine. It is at this moment extremely doubtful whether I have the right to class her among my friends. Quite possibly I shall never see her again. Upstairs I have letters in which she speaks of finding the thought of me a joy, dwelling upon my writing with excitement; I have letters making appointments, pressing for visits, adding postscripts of thanks & affection to visits already paid. But the last is dated December, & it is now February. The question interests, amuses, & also slightly, no, very, decidedly pains me. If it were not that I suspect her of wishing to produce precisely these emotions, save that of amusement, I should be still more put out. As it isâ€”well I should need to write a long description of her before I arrived at my queer balance of interest, amusement, & annoyance. The truth is, I suppose, that one of the conditions unexpressed but understood of our friendship has been precisely that it was almost entirely founded on quicksands. It has been marked by curious slides & arrests; for months Iâ€™ve heard nothing of her; then we have met again upon what has the appearance of solid ground. We have been intimate, intense perhaps rather than open; but to me at anyrate our intercourse has been always interesting & mingled with quite enough of the agreeable personal element to make one fondâ€”if that is the wordâ€”as well as curious. I was at pains to go up to Hampstead every week since mid October or November, I suppose. And then what happened? I go away for Christmas, & we send small bright presents, carefully timed to arrive on Christmas day. I add to mine one if not two long & affectionate letters; I propose to come as soon as I get back. My time in bed prevented this. But meanwhile, for no reason given or to be guessed at with any certainty, she falls silent; I get no thanks, no answers, no enquiries. So suspecting but willing to make every test before coming to conclusions, I asked Murry whether she would like a visit; to which he replied cordially & without the shadow of hesitation. I proposed to go yesterday. About eleven she, or rather the female who keeps house, rang up & put me off, saying that K.M. was too unwell for my visit; but making no suggestion of another time, nor have I any word from her or K. this morning.
