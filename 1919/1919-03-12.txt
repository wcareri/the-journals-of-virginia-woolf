### Wednesday 12 March

Sunday was one of my Shelley house afternoons. There I met Clive, & in his company I was less than ever in touch with the gatheringâ€”as dusky, fur-clad & discreet as ever, though I fancy that I am less impressed by it all than I was, & even take Shelley House more or less as an ordinary house. I had to talk to Elena about Asheham, & find her so slow in her mind, so accustomed I suppose to the position of an ornate & handsome ornament that she positively canâ€™t understand & scurries in her replies, as if she were a fat spaniel crossing a busy road. And her eyes are without depth. Clive gave me dinner at the CafÃ© Royal, which did not much interest me as a show, rather to his disappointment. However towards the end of dinner a woman of doubtful character dining alone with a man threw her glass on the floor, made a great rattle of knives & plates, upset the mustard pot & marched out like an indignant turkey Cock. Was this moment, with the eyes of the diners upon her, what repaid her? Was it for this that she protested? Anyhow she left her man very crestfallen, trying to appear nonchalant; & I daresay that was what she wanted. I couldnâ€™t help thinking of the dreary scene in the flat next morningâ€”the tears, the recriminations, the reconciliationâ€”& next Sunday theyâ€™ll dine, I suppose, at another restaurant.

Dining with Clive now I always feel that we mark the change in our circumstances & views; our present is acted on a background of the past. The present is more amiable, considerably gayer than the past; though not perhaps so interesting. Its interest is different, rather, for I was interested in what he told me of Nessa & R. & D.â€”& in what I could guess of his own attitude; so happy; so vibrant, so epicureanâ€”& yet has he his moments, not exactly of disillusionment, but of feeling that things might have been rather on a larger scale? I doubt it; I fancy he has found his level, & hence his comfort.

On Monday, I think, we had a day of industry. We are coming to the end of Eliotâ€™s poemsâ€”but Iâ€™ve forgotten Saturday, when we had Marjorie Strachey, & the Shoves & Saxon to dinner. Saxon, like the sand in the oyster, was the origin of the whole pearl. We cannot quite face Saxon alone; & had recourse to telephone & telegraph to summon others. I doubt that he likes this. He wants more attention than one can give him in company, & he sits silent, outside the magic circle; no lure draws him in. To me the most interesting object that evening was Gumbo; instantly & undoubtingly I thought her changed. She has come to some decision; she has passed some stage. Doesnâ€™t Conrad say that thereâ€™s a shadow line between youth & middle age? Well, since I saw her last she has crossed it into the smoother greyer waters beyond. She has just had notice to leave her school on account of her short sight. In old days this would not have mattered much; she would have been on with something new; but when I spoke of her as the acrobat flying from trapeze to trapeze she shook her head; no that is all over. She now has her two rooms in Kensington, lives on her earnings, comes home & is glad to be quiet there, glad to find that her charwoman has lit the fireâ€”Things havenâ€™t turned out well. Josâ€™s fault, I suppose. The prospect is drearier than I could face in my own case. I begin to see, now, how my friendsâ€™ lives are shaping. It looks a little as if Marjorie was to be one of the failuresâ€”not that I rank marriage or success in a profession as success. Its an attitude of mindâ€”the way one looks at life.

I must notice that though the sky is as black as water one has washed oneâ€™s hands in, a bird is singing romantically & profusely at the window. On our walk today we passed almond trees in full flower. The daffodils are on the point of bursting. But so far I doubt if weâ€™ve had one day of blue sky, or any heat; nor is there any shadow at Kew, where the shade is universal.

Last night Miss Fox, aged perhaps 26, earning her living, living in rooms with a friend, daughter of an Oxford don & Pippaâ€™s secretary, dined here & lectured the Guild on equal pay. Leonard is preparing to dress for the first time since marriage in an assortment of clothes to dine with David Davies & Venizelos. This morning we had notice to quit from Hoper, & the further blow that he will not let us have the Itford Farm.
