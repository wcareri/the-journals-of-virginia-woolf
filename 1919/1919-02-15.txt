### Saturday 15 February

What a disgraceful lapse! nothing added to my disquisition, & life allowed to waste like a tap left running. Eleven days unrecorded. Still I think if I were a painter I should only need a brush dipped in dun colour to give the tone of those eleven days. I should draw it evenly across the entire canvas. But painters lack subâ tlety; there were points of light, shades beneath the surface, now, I suppose, undiscoverable. The predominant tint was furnished by the need I was under of visiting Registry Offices in the coldest weather of the year. It seems to me that I must have visited a dozen; three was in truth the utmost. But then one was on the verge of civilisation, on the outskirts of Fulham; & how hard, contained, & disillusioned the eyes of the women at the desks become, as if glued in front of them they saw eternally a cook of doubtful character! They can scarcely draw a veil of politeness over them at the sight of me, dressed up in red velvet & fur for their benefit. In the end somehow, Nelly had to go to Charleston for a week, & Phoebe Crane recovered from her illness, & was despatched there, so that peace is temporarily renewed.

Yesterday, Friday, I had one of my occasional galas. Dressed in my best I went to Sickertâ€™s pictures, which I here pronounce the pleasantest, solidest most painter-like show in England. & there I met Clive & Mary; Clive in his fur coat, Mary in the more subdued style of the New English Art Club. Put a yellow cane in Cliveâ€™s hand, & hang a ribbon from an eyeglass, & he would step out of a sporting printâ€”no, a caricature tinted with pinks & yellows. He introduced me to young Nevinson, with the Prince Albert whiskersâ€”making allusion to our both being â€œsuch celebrated figuresâ€, which Nevinson did not appreciate. Later, Clive, Mary & I strolled chattering like a perch of parrokeets, to Verreys, with its blue paint & gilt devices. Mary had a dutiful visit to pay her husband in hospital. So we sat & talked in an inner room,â€”a pleasant, dissipated place, parquet floorâ€”curved bar, little tablesâ€”green & gold flourishes, dilapidated George the 4th style, & empty at this hour, save for some dubious ladies. We talked. We vibrated in sympathy. We billed & cooed. Rosy lights shone on his cheeks. Our intercourse was very gay, vibrant, like that of stringed instruments. Duncan passed throughâ€”a strange shaggy interlude, but, always & inevitably harmonious. He blinked as if newly exposed to the light, crumbled his brioche, & gulped down his coffee, stammering out his half articulated but immensely expressive words; & saying, I remember, how Art & Letters was the dullest & dreariest of papers (â€œIâ€™ll show it youâ€”no, its not in that pocketâ€”no, I donâ€™t know where it is.â€) & how Julian & Quentin were so much cleverer than most children. Somehow, too soon, he hoisted himself into an astonishing long straight black coat, like a non-conformist ministers, hitched down his red waistcoat, & started off in a vague determined way to Victoria Station. And then we sat on, Clive & I, talking of writing, of my writing chiefly, which he praises sufficiently to give his strictures a good deal of force. As I half suspected, he found grave faults in that crude laborious novel of mine; & excessive merits in the Mark; the best prose, he said, written in our day. Mary came in & interrupted, or rather influenced the current of our discourse, for she hardly spoke, & then we turned out into Regent Street where the lamps were lit, & the shop opposite had all its windows full of bright clothes against a green stage scene, & so strolling in the spring twilight & laughing still we made our way through Soho, & I left them, in a street with many jewellers windows.
