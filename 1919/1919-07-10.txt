I have forgotten several people, I see. One is Arundell del RÃ©, Loganâ€™s prize young man, devoted to the cause of good books, & proposing to start a shop in Chelsea for the promotion of them. He intends not only selling on a select principle, but binding, & printing, & providing a room where book lovers can love books. His weakness & paleness did not impress us; but then, perhaps weakness and paleness are the necessary qualities. At a pinch too, I think, like most men, he has business qualities, & brains enough to be dependable. His most serious contribution to an evening of vague discussion was that he should relieve us of all the business of the Hogarth Press, stock our books, keep our accounts, in return for which weâ€™re to give him a few lessons in printing. I suppose something may come of it.

Last night I dined at the Savoy Grill Room with Clive. It is long since eating a meal was such a serious business to meâ€”long since I had taken part in the great ceremony of dinner with others believing in it, assisting at it, & dressing for it. Fish & meat & melon & ices have come to their own again. Clive parted with a good deal of paper money. His appearance never, even now, is altogether smart or wordly; his shoulders are not broad enough, & then his hairâ€”But he was dressed, carried a black cane, & wore a silk hat. Oddly enough my mind went back to my first sight of him years ago. He looked young & had the unselfassured manner of one not used to things, only pretending use. This ceremony of eating takes so long that it was 9 by the time we finished, & the light through the enormous window dusky & almost lamplit. He pointed out to me Picasso & Mdme Picasso making off for the ballet; & behind us sat the little ivory figure of Lopokhovaâ€™s husband. Thus there was every reason for Clive to feel assured. We drove back to Gordon Square & talked about the problems of literature. On his table lay his â€˜puffâ€™ of me in the New Republic; I daresay I should have preferred not to be bracketed with Eliot & Murry. I wonder if I talk nonsense about writing to Clive? On the whole I believe that he has an odd gift for making one talk sense. Heâ€™s so eager that one should talk sense; his enthusiasm is the engaging thing about himâ€”deducting the tribute of his enthusiasm for me. Moreover, whatever one may think of his taste in life, however one may feel him a little battered & dusty in the pursuit of pleasure, still thereâ€™s his honesty; his vivacity; his determination not to be bored, & not to bore. In his own way he is somehow a figure.
