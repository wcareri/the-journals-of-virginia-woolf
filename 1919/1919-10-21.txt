### Tuesday 21 October

This is Trafalgar day, & yesterday is memorable for the appearance of Night & Day. My six copies reached me in the morning, & five were despatched, so that I figure the beaks of five friends already imbedded. Am I nervous? Oddly little; more excited & pleased than nervous. In the first place, there it is, out & done with; then I read a bit & liked it; then I have a kind of confidence, that the people whose judgment I value will probably think well of it, which is much reinforced by the knowledge that even if they dont, I shall pick up & start another story on my own. Of course, if Morgan & Lytton & the others should be enthusiastic, I should think the better of myself. The bore is meeting people who say the usual things. But on the whole, I see what Iâ€™m aiming at; what I feel is that this time Iâ€™ve had a fair chance & done my best; so that I can be philosophic & lay the blame on God. Lovely autumn days come one after another; the leaves hanging like rare gold coins on the trees. Clive was at the Club yesterday, & talked ostensibly to me, but to the whole room in reality some of whom judged him a little bounder, I suppose, & turned round & thanked God when he left the room.

O yes, I should like a good long review in the Times.
