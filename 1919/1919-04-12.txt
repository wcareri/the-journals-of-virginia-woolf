### Saturday 12 April

These ten minutes are stolen from Moll Flanders, which I failed to finish yesterday in accordance with my time sheet, yielding to a desire to stop reading & go up to London. But I saw London, in particular the view of white city churches & palaces from Hungerford Bridge through the eyes of Defoe. I saw the old women selling matches through his eyes; & the draggled girl skirting round the pavement of St. Jamesâ€™ Square seemed to me out of Roxana or Moll Flanders. Yes, a great writer surely to be thus imposing himself upon me after 200 years. A great writerâ€”& Forster has never read his books! I was beckoned by Forster from the Library as I approached. We shook hands very cordially; & yet I always feel him shrinking sensitively from me, as a woman, a clever woman, an up to date woman. Feeling this I commanded him to read Defoe, & left him, & went & got some more Defoe, having bought one volume at Bickers on the way. Then to the Club; & met Alix, all in a new outfit to match the spring; brown too, & happier than usual, being now mistress of 41 Gordon Square, where James is to lodge, though she declares several dusky Brazilians have made their head quarters there. So home with L. walking over Hungerford Bridge on a fine warm evening & thinking of Defoe as I say. L. is now off to address the Cingalese; & Herbert Fisher has astounded us by asking himself to lunch tomorrow, & we have been to Kew, & seen the Magnolia trees in blossom.
