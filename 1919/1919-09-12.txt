### Thursday 12 September

The weight upon my mind is lessening, though, as I have not yet mastered a writing board, the long leisurely filling of these blank pages which I promised myself becomes something of a mirage. But then Duncan & Nessa have just been over unexpectedly to tea. Other peoples incursions always leave me tremulous. They break in upon a mood of depression, deep according to L.; to me of the consistency of September mist. Why is it, I wonder? Partly that for 10 days I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve had a letter; then I expect something unpleasant from Macmillans. Here I make my forecast. â€œWe have read Night & Day with the deepest interest, but hardly think it would appeal to our public over here.â€ Though I foretell this, & see that written down it is negligible as criticism, yet I want to have that unpleasant moment over. It will infect me for a few days. And the publication of N. & D. may perhaps send an occasional tremor through me for all my boasting. If that is pronounced a failure, I dont see why I should continue writing novels. These are the usual writers melancholies. On top of them, thereâ€™s been the move, the comparison of this place with Asheham, servantsâ€”& so on. Writing has been done under difficulties. I was making way with my new experiment, when I came up against Sir Thomas Browne, & found I hadnâ€™t read him since I used to dip & duck & be bored & somewhow enchanted hundreds of years ago. Therefore I had to break off, send for his books (by the way, I have read him fairly often, now I come to think of it) & start little stories. These are always ticklish; a bad morning reduces one to melancholy. But since I began to write this, Iâ€™ve suffered so many interruptions, that my mood is no longer benignant. I think I shall yield to temptation & see what the sun is doing over the meadows. O the thousand appliances one needs for writing even a sentence! No books from The Times either, & as for writing a letter, I cant bring myself to break the virginity of a sheet of paper.
