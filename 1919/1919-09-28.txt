### Sunday 28 September (perhaps the 28th at least)

Cut off as we are from all human intercourse (unless you count the Dedmans) I cannot be sure even of the date. It is said that the entire railways of England are on strike; the miners, & perhaps the transport workers, are with them. This happened yesterday morning, or rather late the night before; & though we got our papers through late in the evening, we are without posts. The signalman gave us some information yesterday, & believes himself to be striking against a reduction of 14/ a week in his wages. His strike pay comes to 16/ a week. How with prices what they are the strike can be kept up more than a day or two it is difficult to see. He expects a settlement tomorrow; but as he hopes it, one canâ€™t trust him, & like all the rest, he knows far less about the reasons & machinations than we doâ€”L. at any rate. At present, what with Sunday & the quiet one imagines on the lines, a queer deep silence seems to lie upon us. We post letters knowing they wont get further than Lewes. There is talk of a motor car service. The Government make a show of courageous determination. We are on war rations, & told to be brave & good. Not since coaching days has the village of Rodmell been so isolated as it is at the present moment. Yet a state of siege has a certain snugness & self sufficiency about it. No one can interrupt. I have given myself a respite from Hope Mirrlees, whose review ought to have been dispatched this morning. If it lasts another day or two the food difficulty will begin. Then thereâ€™s the question of getting back on Thursday.

Until this strike came our main concern has been L.â€™s arm. A week ago, or last Monday his wrist & arm broke into a rash. The Dr called it eczema. Then Mrs Dedman brushed this aside & diagnosed sunflower poisoning. L. had been uprooting them with bare hands. We have accepted her judgment, which is confirmed by the case of Mrs Woolerâ€™s brother, but that doesnâ€™t do away with the fact that its a vile & irritating disease. Today for the first time the swelling is less, & the rash improved. But the week has been much damaged in consequence. Yesterday we went over to Asheham, plundered the hollow of its mushrooms, & then got in at the drawing room window. Gunn is spending Â£60 on turning it into a rose pink boudoirâ€”that colour at least predominates. But they have evidently taken a book of patterns & marked out the most respectable bright colours, so that the rooms are all as smooth & impeccable & glossy as can be. There are mustard yellows & pillar box reds. Of course, I couldnâ€™t approve, but I should have liked it still less if he had chosen after my own taste, & the house had looked as dim & mysterious as ever. I dont know whether its oneâ€™s accommodating temper that painted the place a little shut in & dismal, with the vast hollow behind & the straight view between trees in front. I thought it lacking in variety, this time, & colourâ€”but I expect this is one of the devices of the imagination. Anyhow Monkâ€™s improves, after the fashion of a mongrel who wins your heart. I should have said a good deal about the garden only the temptation of being there instead of describing it from within has been too much even for my confirmed habits. The green of the turf with the bunch of purple Japanese anemones keeps getting in my eyes. We have been planting tiny grains of seed in the front bed, in the pious or religious belief that they will resurrect next spring as Clarkia, Calceolaria, Campanula, Larkspur & Scabious. I shanâ€™t recognise them if they do; we are planting at a venture, inspired by seedsmenâ€™s language: how they stand high & bear bright blue petals. Then thereâ€™s weeding. Very soon, in any occupation, one makes a game of it. I mean (for Iâ€™m cold & inept at the momentâ€”church bells ringing, fire just catching, & the great log we sawed about to plunge into fiery caverns) that one gives characters to weeds. The worst is the fine grass which has to be sifted out conscientiously. I like uprooting thick dandelions & groundsel. Then the tea bell rings, & though I sit & ponder over my cigarette, L. runs out like a child allowed to get down & go. And as I say, today weâ€™re on our island, which will be boarded tomorrow, oddly enough, by Clive.

Iâ€™ve reviewed Hope; Gosse & Swinnerton, all in the past 10 days so that the great autumn downpour is beginning. It crosses my mind now & then that Night & Day will be one drop of it: but that seems to belong to Londonâ€”not here. The bore will be meeting people, who think they must say that they have not read it; perhaps worse, that they have. That will last six weeks; then no more.
