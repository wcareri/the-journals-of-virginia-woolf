Well, Macmillanâ€™s letter came this morning, & is neither so good nor so bad as it might have been. They read with great interest, think N. & D. a fine work, but not likely to appeal to a wide public in America, & too long to be, at this season, worth reprinting. But they propose to take 500 or 1000 sheets from Gerald; the same number of The Voyage Out, & understand that I will offer them my next book. On the whole, Iâ€™m rather pleased than otherwise. The Voyage Out will be exhausted; certainly this is the only method of becoming known to America, & presumably Macmillans think me worth keeping in view. Heaven knows when my next novel will be ready! The same post brought their refusal of Leâ€™s book, they will take sheets of that too. It donâ€™t much matter. I shall accept, I suppose, since thereâ€™s scarcely time to try elsewhere. But I dont think Macmillan had much to do with my depression. Do I envy Nessa her overflowing household? Perhaps at moments. Julian has gone into a preparatory form of breeches; everything flourishing & humane there; perhaps I canâ€™t help a contrast which never occurs when Iâ€™m in full flood of work. I made these comparisons yesterday, when I lunched there & spent the afternoon & rode home. By the way, Iâ€™m an ingrate to nourish the least private cloud in the face of such brightness of sky. The downs all black against scarlet & gold, as I rode home, stopping to look at Asheham, which had its windows open as if lived in. Mr Geal was going up to pick apples. But Monkâ€™s House gives one a pleasant little shock as one opens the gate. I found L. & Nelly just back from Lewes with her new bicycle. He had spent the day in London. Seven has struck & Iâ€™m tempted to walk upon the flats. I had meant to say something about these queer spiritual states. They interest me, even when Iâ€™m the subject. And I always remember the saying that at oneâ€™s lowest ebb one is nearest a true vision. I think perhaps 9 people out of ten never get a day in the year of such happiness as I have almost constantly; now Iâ€™m having a turn of their lot.
