### Saturday 15 March

Today was to have been the happiest of the week, & then among my letters was one from Duncan, which looked to me ominous, & proved of course to contain a demand for Nelly as soon as possible. What else but a demand is it when he says that Nessa is becoming completely knocked up by incessant work & responsibility? So I have wired to say she will go if possible for 3 weeks; & the prelude to the wire was unpleasant, & the postscript will be still more so. For the moment this house represents a little island of refuge to the childbearers; Karin rang up last night to suggest that we should take Ann, Judith & Mabel for a fortnight, which fortnight they are going to spend at Asheham. But no one can see how difficult it is to detach a cook or to take in children when oneâ€™s organisation is framed on a different scaleâ€”however its enough to live oneâ€™s disagreeables without writing them. Moreover we refused to take Mabel & Ann & Judith.

On Thursday Bruce & Elena dined hereâ€”rather an event. But it went off peaceably enough. They, at least, are well beyond the shadow line; I found him mellower & milder & less spruce than I expected, which pleased me in the admiring editor of my works. As for Elena her distinction in black with a jade jewel is undeniable; her white hair too, on the top of a face coloured like almond blossom; & with all this stateliness & repose an air, if I mistake not, of melancholy, as of hopes not realised & acquiescence accepted instead of something warmer, which slightly touched me, guessing the cause of it. Her notes are very few. But she could discuss the Indian Bill with L. & Indian religions; so that I daresay her slowness & apparent stupidity are only that she finds herself out of her element with me. We talked, much about Asheham of course, & the evening passed quietly, sedately, & with only one or two of those awkward pauses which I remember in their house. He treats her rather as a large magnificent child. â€œO youâ€™ll like thatâ€ he said when I offered her a bulls eye, & she told me she had noticed a very nice sweetshop in the street. I fancy that Bruce is a kindly & very unambitious man, who has been quite pleased to spend his time in doing kindnesses to poverty stricken young men & fitting the articles into the advertisements in the Supplement, which he says is not such as easy job as it looks. â€œWhen the great catastrophe happensâ€ he said, alluding to Lord Northcliffe, there is a Walter who is going to buy back the Times, & make it into a decent paper again. They went down to see Asheham on Friday, but the result is not yet known to us. L. is right I think in saying that Elenaâ€™s place ought to be in a big house in a village, distributing alms. I asked vaguely for a compositor & she undertook very scrupulously to find me one, being in touch of course with various organisations.

On Friday I went to London & had tea with Mrs Hamiltonâ€”Molly that is: I had to correct myself half a dozen times. L. has now got into the habit of lunching in London twice a week, & so appeasing the gaping maws of Green & Matthew. Murry is in the next room & has asked L. to do the social, I mean social reform, side of the Atheneuam, pressing upon him a large yellow book for review. James Strachey has extracted the post of dramatic critic. Eliot may be sub-editor. The first number comes out on April 4th. These little bits of literary gossip strike me as slightly discreditable. They point perhaps to oneâ€™s becoming a professional, a hack of the type of Mrs W. K. Clifford, who used to know exactly what everyone was paid, & who wrote what, & all the rest of it. I can see father listening with disapproval but secret enjoyment. Mrs Hamilton made me feel a little professional, for she had her table strewn with manuscripts, a book open on the desk, & she began by asking me about my novel; & then we talked about reviewing, & I was interested to hear who had reviewed Martin SchÃ¼ler, & was a little ashamed of being interested. She told me a curious thing about the sensibilities of my familyâ€”Adrian had asked her to tell me how much heâ€™d liked The Voyage Out, which he has just read for the first time, & is too shy to write & tell me so himself. She has 2 or 3 sisters, all artists according to her, though the designs for stained glass that I saw didnâ€™t seem to me to prove it; & one is a poet, who surrounds herself with sketches of projected books on every conceivable subject, & has written a long poem which she wants us to consider publishing. â€œShe is a poetâ€”certainly a poetâ€, she said, which roused my suspicions. The truth is that Molly Hamilton with all her ability to think like a man, & her strong serviceable mind, & her independent, self-respecting life is not a writer. But we exchanged the plots of our novels, & said â€œHow very interestingâ€”â€
