### Thursday 30 October

I have the excuse of rheumatism for not writing more; & my hand tired of writing, apart from rheumatism. Still, if I could treat myself professionally as a subject for analysis I could make an interesting story of the past few days, of my vicissitudes about N. & D. After Cliveâ€™s letter came Nessaâ€™sâ€”unstinted praise; on top of that Lyttonâ€™s: enthusiastic praise; a grand triumph; a classic; & so on; Violetâ€™s sentence of eulogy followed; & then, yesterday morning, this line from Morgan â€œI like it less than the V.O.â€ Though he spoke also of great admiration, & had read in haste & proposed re-reading, this rubbed out all the pleasure of the rest. Yes; but to continue. About 3 in the afternoon I felt happier & easier on account of his blame than on account of the othersâ€™ praiseâ€”as if one were in the human atmosphere again, after a blissful roll among elastic clouds & cushiony downs. Yet I suppose I value Morganâ€™s opinion as much as anybodies. Then thereâ€™s a column in the Times this morning; high praise; & intelligent too; saying among other things that N. & D. though it has less brilliance on the surface, has more depth than the other; with which I agree. I hope this week will see me through the reviews, I should like intelligent letters to follow; but I want to be writing little stories; I feel a load off my mind all the same.

The rheumatism made me visit the region which is in my mind the mediaeval region. Clive burst in I was going to say like a ruddy sun last night; but I wasnâ€™t altogether in the mood, nor he either. The most selfish of men, in some ways; though I donâ€™t know why that struck me. Letting his mood have its way, indifferent & frivolous. But I pinned him down, & made him talk about N. & D. which he did, absentmindedly at first; later he warmed to his task; but he was thinking of a jolly time in Paris.
