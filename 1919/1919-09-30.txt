### Tuesday 30 September

This is opened to record the Strike bulletin. Nothing has happened. All railways are silent. I went into Lewes yesterday, & found a kind of modified Sunday prevailing; shutters half closed at post & railway station. There were numbers of motors with luggage & the pampered rich. Rumourâ€”shop keepers, that is to say,â€”predicts a long strike. Whoâ€™s in the right, they dont say: â€˜anyhow its bad for usâ€™. In our private world the discomfort is mostly what we imagine for the future. We can make no plans anyhow. Last night Clive did not come, & thinking this implied disaster to N. in London, I telegraphed first thing this morning; no answer yet, & its struck seven. The papers are just in, shrunk to single sheets, & untrustworthy in their extremeâ€”Daily Mail & Herald; truthful in the middle perhaps, Daily News. So far nothing but persistent hostility on both sides; no overtures. To increase our private sense of the ominous, Mr Dean chose this day to move the cupboards. The house is therefore scattered with books & furniture, but we gain a dining room. To appease us, the weather stays fine as possible, clear, cold, still, & sunny. Clive stayed at Charleston nursing a cold. No letters since Saturday morning, save his card, which is local. We shall be without butter, coffee, & cigarettes in a day or two, getting them from London.
