### Saturday 15 November

It is true that I have never been so neglectful of this work of mine. I think I can foresee in my reluctance to trace a sentence, not merely lack of time & a mind tired of writing, but also one of those slight distastes which betokens a change of style. So an animal must feel at the approach of spring when his coat changes. Will it always be the same? Shall I always feel this quicksilver surface in my language; & always be shaking it from shape to shape? But if this is so, it is only part cause of my neglect. There have been substantial difficulties. We were with Lytton last Sunday; on Monday I was at Harrisons, & back just in time for Moll H. (to distinguish her from Molly M.): Tuesday I wrote letters; Wednesday, at a concert, with Violet Dickinson immediately after; Thursday Molly M., for tea & after tea; Friday to Margaret & Lilian, & so here I am, sitting after Saturday tea, a large warm meal, full of currants & sugar & hot tea cake, after a long cold walk. If I shut my eyes & thought of Tidmarsh, what should I see? Carrington a little absorbed with household duties; secreting canvas in the attic; Saxon mute & sealed till Sunday night, when he flowered for a time & talked of Greek; Lyttonâ€”a more complex situation. Good & simple & tenderâ€”a little low in tone; a little invalidish. If Iâ€™d married him, I caught myself thinking, I should have found him querulous. He would have laid too many ties on one, & repined a little if one had broken free. He was in his usual health (as they say); but the sense of living so much for health, & assembling so many comforts round him with that object is a little depressing. But I always qualify these strictures, which Iâ€™m quick to find I know, with some subconscious idea of justifying myself. I need no justification. And what I feel for Lytton is as true as ever it was. We sit alone over the fire & rattle on, so quick, so agile in our jumps & circumventions. Lytton I suppose if one could dissolve all extraneous surroundings has in the centre of him a great passion for the mind. He cares for more than literature only. On his table were the latest editions of Voltaire. His books were as primly ranged & carefully tended as an old maids china. He talked of his own work, not optimistically, but one must discount the effect of my perhaps excessive optimism about my own writing. I was in the vein to feel very highly â€˜creativeâ€™, as indeed he said he thought me. But he declares himself entirely without that power. He can invent nothing, he says; take away his authorities, & he comes to a full stop. Perhaps this is true of all Stracheys, & accounts for the queer feelingâ€”which I will not analyse, since in Lyttonâ€™s case the rightness, the subtlety, the fineness, of his mind quite overcome my furtive discomfort. Moll H. still strains at her leash like the spaniel of my legend; but foams with enthusiasm for N. & D. It is a rough eager mind, bold & straightforward, but O dearâ€”when it comes to writing! Her courage impresses me; & the sense she gives of a machine working at high pressure all day longâ€”the ordinary able machine of the professional working woman. A tailor made coat costing Â£16 is essential she said to exact respect in an office. That shows her competent grasp upon life. But why do I always like people & so throw out my judgments? It is true that I always do.

I think Violet Dickinson must be skipped, save that I may note how she has been grave finding in France & planting Lady Hornerâ€™s rosemarys upon German tombs. All this she enjoyed highly, in her humorous sporting way, & had been most touched by an inscription she found telling how Ainsworth of the hussars had loved his life & loved his horse & dog.

So we skip to Molly who took her tea in the kitchen & drew an amusing sketch of Uncle Gerald Ritchie gone mad & rushing in taxis from fruiterer to fruiterer to buy melons which he showers on his friends in an ecstasy of good temper, pronounced madness by the doctors since he is positively rude to his wife. Lastly, we approach the heights of Hampsteadâ€”the immaculate & moral heights of Hampstead. Had I the energy left I would write out that scene of revelation & explanation with Margaret, since in 30 minutes we traversed more ground than in the past 3 years. Tentatively she began itâ€”how Janet & she felt that perhapsâ€”they might be wrong, but still in their viewâ€”in short my article on Charlotte BrontÃ« was so much more to their liking than my novels. Something in my feeling for human beingsâ€”some narrownessâ€”some lack of emotionâ€”here I blazed up & let fly. So you go on preaching humanity, was the gist of what I said, when youâ€™ve withdrawn, & preserve only the conventional idea of it. But its you that are narrow! she retaliated. On the contrary, I shiver & shrink with the oncoming contest as I step up your stairs. I? But Iâ€™m the most sympathetic, the most human, the most universal of people. You grant that Janet moralises? I said. O yes, she granted that readily. But the idea of herself as a forcible intense woman, excluding the greater half of the human heart staggered her. She took the blow well. It was as if one had suddenly drawn some curtain. She must think it over, & write to me she said. I plunged down the hill to Lilianâ€™s bedside, & she in her serene quiet way said â€œAh, Iâ€™m glad you told Margaret that; she never will let me say it.â€
