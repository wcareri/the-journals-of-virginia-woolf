### Friday 28 November

This gap can easily be accounted for by recalling the old saying (if it is one) that when things happen, people donâ€™t write. Too many things have happened. Within this last fortnight the International Review has come to an end; both servants are going; two publishers have offered to publish N. & D. & V. O. in America; Angelica has stayed with us; Mrs Brewer has told us that she means to sell Hogarth & Suffield, & we are considering buying them bothâ€”together with a greater number than usual of diners, letters, telephone calls, books to review, reviews of my book, invitations to parties & so forth. It was the dinner parties that led Nelly to give notice last Monday. She did it in a tentative boastful way, as if to show off to someone behind the scenes which makes me think she would be glad now to change her mind. She would this moment if I asked her. But on the whole Iâ€™m not going to ask her. Let alone the recurring worry of these scenes we both incline to try a new system of dailies, which never ceases to attract us & what with Rodmell & a lower income from the I.R. now becomes desirable. My opinion never changes that our domestic system is wrong; & to go on saying this only breeds irritation. We mean to make the attempt now. No one could be nicer than Nelly, for long stretches; at this moment she gives Angelica her bath, & is perfectly friendly & considerate to me; but think of Rodmellâ€”think of the summer she offered to go to Charleston! The drawbacks are too great. But the fault is more in the system of keeping two young women chained in a kitchen to laze & work & suck their life from two in the drawing room than in her character or in mine.

Perhaps I think this our chief event, since I put it first. But the chief event should be the I.R. Iâ€™m on the whole glad that we draw our Â£250 for half L.â€™s work. That is the solution so farâ€”an amalgamation with the Contemporary. So many afternoons I walked alone, so many evenings L. sat reading proofs or papers; to me the red magazine on the first of the month seemed scarcely worth all of him that he gave. But then to have thrown that away is galling too, & the Rowntreeâ€™s methods of making arrangements is to smash everything with his heavy hooves. Then I was considerably pleased with the American publishers, & that the old V.O. should set sail again. It is like going into another form. â€œMrs Woolf you are now admitted to our society.â€ Yet that sort of compliment means very little so far as praise goes; nor was I elated for more than 2 hours by Eagleâ€™s invitation to make his broad yellow production my mouthpiece. K.M. wrote a review which irritated meâ€”I thought I saw spite in it. A decorous elderly dullard she describes me; Jane Austen up to date. Leonard supposes that she let her wish for my failure have its way with her pen. He could see her looking about for a loophole of escape. â€œIâ€™m not going to call this a successâ€”or if I must, Iâ€™ll call it the wrong kind of success.â€ I need not now spread my charity so wide, since Murry tells me she is practically cured. But what I perceive in all this is that praise hardly warms; blame stings far more keenly; & both are somehow at arms length. Yet its on the cards, I suppose, that N & D is a marked success; I expect a letter every day from someone or other, & now I can write with the sense of many people willing to read. Its all pleasant; lights up the first sentences of my writing of a morning. Today, bearing K.M. in mind, I refused to do Dorothy Richardson for the Supt. The truth is that when I looked at it, I felt myself looking for faults; hoping for them. And they would have bent my pen, I know. There must be an instinct of self-preservation at work. If sheâ€™s good then Iâ€™m not. Iâ€™m pained to read praise of Legend, a book by Clemence Dane. But it looks as if I had a soul after all; these are revelations, self analyses. Iâ€™m reading Ethel Smyth. I wish it were betterâ€”(odd that I wrote that genuinely meaning it; but I couldnâ€™t have done so with the novels). What a subject! That one should see it as a superb subject is a tribute to her, but of course, not knowing how to write, sheâ€™s muffed it. The interest remains, because she has ridden straight at her recollections, never swerving & getting through honestly, capably, but without the power to still & shape the past so that one will wish to read it again. Honesty is her quality; & the fact that she made a great rush at life; friendships with women interest me.
