### Tuesday 25 February

Well, I havenâ€™t even quarrelled with Mirrleesâ€”my literary ladies are faithful, though intermittent, whether purposely or not, I donâ€™t undertake to say. But these speculations obliterate what I see I call â€˜lifeâ€™. The truth is I shirk the gigantic task of giving an account of Sundays teaparty, at which I met Sir Val. Chirrol, Sir Henry Newbolt & Lady, Lady Cromer, the Bruce Richmonds, & a scattering of gallant bald cavalry officers, & mounds of South Kensington dowager respectability who must be nameless. Sir Val & Katie both foretold a revolution, & seemed to picture themselves meeting death nobly for the principle of respectability at the hands of the Russian Jews. Russian Jews invest every great cityâ€”a people of enormous energy & unscrupulosityâ€”& then, as Sir Val remarked, 1914 will never come againâ€”â€œnot that anyone could accuse me of pacifismâ€. Meanwhile Sir Henry confessed that music, especially the music of strings, moves the fount of poetry in him, & â€œsomething always comes of a concertâ€”something will come this eveningâ€â€”he assured me, as a priest foretelling a miracle, or a conjuror producing a rabbit, But the amiability of South Kensington is disarming. A kind of modesty veils what is so prominent & disagreeable in the intellectuals. They have an air of saying â€œI am no oneâ€”no one at all. My only function is to be agreeable. Another cup of tea? Do for goodness sake take this arm chairâ€”& let me fetch you a slice of bread & butterâ€”â€ Thats my impression of the moment; though for some reason it doesnâ€™t encourage one to say anything more interesting than Thank you & please dont trouble, & other phrases of the kind. Of no 23 Cromwell Houses, fronting the stuffed beasts, & quite capable of staring them out of countenance, I will only say that it is furnished on the great South Kensington principle of being on the safe side & doing the thing handsomely. Good Mrs Samuel Bruce went to the Autotype Company & ordered the entire Dutch school to be sent round framed in fumed oak. And so they were; & just covered the staircase walls, leaving an inch or twoâ€™s margin in between. The drawing roomâ€”no, I cant write it all out; memory preserves only the shoulders of a horse on a gilt easel, & three large seascapes, like slabs of thick bread & butter. The company was decorous & fur bearing as usual; & the music like the voice of spirits in another world enticing the hopelessly damned. Sir Henry wrote a patriotic song to the tune of it. But how nice they are too!â€”Katie shouldering her way along the streets afterwards, & letting fall sentences of curious remote force, as though she were on top of a mountain, or lost in a mist, as I canâ€™t help feeling these aristocrats are.

Not, however, Lord Eustace Percy. But at him my pen boggles, since I cannot delve any further back into the week. How modestly he started, smoking his pipe like any commoner, like poor rubber faced little Ewer himself, or wry-necked Burns, & then by degrees how authoritative & masterly lie became, & beat the table to make his points, & pulled his audience up short, & bade them â€œWait a secondâ€, or asked them â€œWell, What do you suggest then? What is your answer to that?â€ like some transcendent head master, to whom the rest of us are but little children spelling out their lesson, very badly stumbling over the long words; & Lord Eustace, in his goodness, undertakes to enlighten us. I got the impression of a very able man & a very aristocratic man, & a very nice manâ€”a combination that is so irresistable as to be alarming. He explained the League of Nations draft.

Very well: but now we come to another of the ornate & decorated tribe; try as she will she can never lay aside her coronet; I mean poor dear old Ottoline. We dined at Gattiâ€™s together last night. I fetched her from the family bosom of Garlands Hotel. She has the slim swaying figure of a Lombardy poplarâ€”the ridges & hollows of the cheeks are the only sign of her years (47 I make them); & a feeble mincing step on the street, like that of a cockatoo with bad claws. She has an indomitable spiritâ€”plucking life out with those same gouty claws as if she were young & had illusions by the score. She had swooped down upon the land agents wife, & upon Rosa Allatiniâ€”for no reason save that the land agents wife writes novels, & Rosa Allatini has had her novel burnt by the hangman. Allatini was a bad choice, save that she almost fainted & had to be fed on bath buns, which Ottoline had by herâ€”& confided, of course, the story of her unhappy love, which made it necessary for her to be fed on Bath Buns. Birrell had been to tea, remarking how Queen Victoria liked nothing better than the sight of a drunken man; Lopokova had been discoursing all the afternoon. As we sat aâ t dinner Ott picked up scraps of talk from the other diners, & admired their profiles. And so round to Gordon Square where we found Clive at the top of the house, where I used to stand & write, in the largest arm chair ever seen, by the finest fire, with a screen across the door to keep the draught out, as affable as a cockatoo & as brightly coloured as a macaw. I left them together & lost my train.
