### Wednesday 22 January

Today is Wednesday, Jan. 22nd. Two days more were spent in bed, & today counts as my first of complete health. I even wrote a sentence of alterations and additions this morning. I have a book on Meredith to do for the Times, & we walked this afternoon, so I am back again nearly in my old position. As I canâ€™t get up to London, & only see little framed pictures of Alix & Fredegond sitting by the fire here, I might attempt that solid foundation which I think desirable.

How many friends have I got? Thereâ€™s Lytton, Desmond, Saxon; they belong to the Cambridge stage of life; very intellectual; cut free from Hyde Park Gate; connected with Thoby; but I canâ€™t put them in order, for there are too many. Ka & Rupert & Duncan, for example, all come rather later; they belong to Fitzroy days; the Oliviers & all that set are stamped as the time of Brunswick Sqre; Clive I put a little aside; later still there are the cropheads, Alix, Carrington, Barbara, Nick, Bunny. I must insert too the set that runs parallel but does not mix, distinguished by their social & political character, headed perhaps by Margaret & including people like Goldie, Mrs Hamilton, & intermittent figures such as Matthaei, Hobson, the Webbsâ€”no, I canâ€™t include either the darkies, or Dr Leys, though they stand for the occasional visitor who lunches & retires to L.â€™s room to talk seriously. I have not placed Ottoline or Roger, & again there are Katherine & Murry & the latest of all, Hope Mirrlees, who recalls Pernel & Pippa & outlying figures such as Ray & Oliver. Gertler I must omit (& Mary Hutch, too) for reasons which if my account gets written I might give; & Eliot I liked on the strength of one visit & shall probably see more of, owing to his poems which we began today to set up.

This is a very partial account, but I shall never place half of them accurately unless I start straight away. Lytton & Desmond & Saxon then. Well, I cherish a considerable friendship for each of them; the worst of it is how seldom we meet. With Lytton & Desmond till last month tethered to a stool in the Admiralty, months pass without a sight of them. The season of letter writing is over for all of us, I think; or perhaps we need different correspondents. Brilliant letters we wrote each other once, partly for the sake of being brilliant, & we were getting to know each other then, & there was a thrill about it (I speak of my own feelings.) But when we do meet, there is nothing to complain of. Lytton is said to be more tolerant & less witty; Desmond, they say, needs a glass of wine; Saxon has his rheumatics & his hopeless love affair. Lytton again is famous these last six months, but as that was a matter of course since his first six months there is not much surprise or change in it. Moreover, I hear he has abandoned his Asquiths or they are provided with some later light. Nothing is easier or more intimate than a talk with Lytton. If he is less witty, he is more humane. Presumably, judging from precedent & taking into account the demobilisation of the army, he is now preparing to fly, but as his alliance is not with me the direction he flies in makes very little difference. I like Carrington though. She has increased his benignity. O yes, if he were to walk in at this moment we should talk about books & feelings & life & the rest of it as freely as we ever did, & with the sense, on both sides I think, of having hoarded for this precise moment a great deal peculiarly fit for the other.
