### Sunday 14 September

Well, I dont think my turn of their lot is a very serious matter. The interesting thing is that one does, normally, keep up a kind of vibration, for no reason whatever. Equally for no reason whatever, the vibration stops. Then one enquires why one ever had it, & there seems no reason why one should ever have it again. Things seem clear, sane, comprehensible, & under no obligation, being of that nature, to make one vibrate at all. Indeed, its largely the clearness of sight which comes at such seasons that leads to depression. But when one can analyse it, one is half way back again. I feel unreason slowly tingling in my veins. If I could have a good morningâ€™s work! We went for our first Sunday walk today. In order to counteract the tremendous draw of the garden we have arranged two walks a week, on Sundays & Wednesdays. Today we went on the downs towards Kingston. For the first of many days it was cloudy; a north east wind, a threatening of rain. We saw the sea at Brighton & the sea at Eastbourne to right & left of us. The valley slopes behind the down are very lovely; the down itself rising to some height, but intersected by railings. I think the views are finer this side than the other, though the downs themselves inferior. I must try a little Plato nowâ€”to prove that concentration is as easy here as elsewhere.
