### Friday 5 December

Another of these skips, but I think the book draws its breath steadily if with deliberation. I reflect that Iâ€™ve not opened a Greek book since we came back; hardly read outside my review books, which proves that my time for writing has not been mine at all. This last week, L. has been having a little temperature in the evening, due to malaria, & that due to a visit to Oxford; a place of death & decay. Iâ€™m almost alarmed to see how entirely my weight rests on his prop. And almost alarmed to find how intensely Iâ€™m specialised. My mind turned by anxiety, or other cause, from its scrutiny of blank paper, is like a lost childâ€”wandering the house, sitting on the bottom step to cry.

Night & Day flutters about me still, & causes great loss of time. George Eliot would never read reviews, since talk of her books hampered her writing. I begin to see what she meant. I donâ€™t take praise or blame excessively to heart, but they interrupt, cast oneâ€™s eyes backwards, make one wish to explain or investigate. Last week I had a cutting paragraph to myself in Wayfarer; this week Olive Heseltine applies balm. But I had rather write in my own way of â€˜four Passionate Snailsâ€™ than be, as K.M. maintains, Jane Austen over again.
