### Wednesday 7 May

& thus my writing got interrupted, but I had the hot bath I remember, after duly, though a little insincerely, admiring what had been done in my absence. To recapitulate the events of Asheham is no longer in my power, or perhaps, since they were mainly of a spiritual nature requiring some subtlety to relate, Iâ€™m too lazy to try. Happinessâ€”what, I wonder constitutes happiness? I daresay the most important element is work, & that rarely fails either of us now. Leonard, of course, had his telegram from Sharp, & an article to do in a hurry; but 1500 words now merely fill a morning pleasantly for him. Then there were two moments of some anxiety: first, a letter from Captain Short to say we can have Tregerthen, which we now possess; then a letter from Gerald to say he has read Night & Day with â€œthe greatest interestâ€ & will be delighted to publish it. I suppose, as I go to the trouble of copying his words verbatim, that I was a good deal pleased by them. The first impression of an outsider, especially one who proposes to back his opinion with money, means something; though I canâ€™t think of stout smooth Gerald smoking a cigar over my pages without a smile. However, a good deal beyond this letter in importance was Captain Shortâ€™s. For a day to two I did nothing but put my pen down or my book & see Tregerthen. Considering the extreme inhospitality of Eastbourne agents, I daresay we are well advised from a practical point of view, to be sure of some retreat. But Asheham, as if to keep our loyalty, breathed its usual charm. It compares very well with Charleston; indeed Iâ€™ve never come back to it without that feeling of being incredulous as one perfection was added to another. This time we spent most of our day in the house, owing to the weather. L. scarcely left the garden. One walk insufficiently clothed to Southease was very bitter. I got over to Charleston, though; & had a night & morning alone with V.â€”so far as she can ever be alone. There was Pitcher, the new gardener; Angelica; Julian & Quentin of course; the new nurse; & a fire which wouldnâ€™t burn. Indeed living is fairly bare at the moment. I had the rare sensation of its being necessary to eat, in order to support life. They have bread by the yard, as if slid along a slot; all the necessaries; but not an ornament. My life, by comparison, seems padded at every turn. But they all looked as vigorous as possible. The floors strewn with Burnet stuffs for the Flat; & as usual, a good deal of domestic talk; sleep in the ground floor room at night, where this time last year about I heard the nightingales, & the fishes splashing in the pond, white roses tapped at the window: that night when I was told that Angelica was in evidence. Nothing but wind & rain this time, & no coal in the house.

Yesterday, Tuesday, we both renewed London life in the usual way; save that I had to buy stuff for dresses, as well as paper labels & glue. Tea at the Club, where Alix, dusky & dreary, borrowed 10/ in order to give James his dinner. They were going to hear Bertie lecture; I preferred the songsters of Trafalgar Square. The steps of the column were built up, pyramid fashion, with elderly respectable householders grasping sheets of music, which they rendered, in time to a conductor on a chair beneath, with great precision. It was Life boat day, & the elderly people were singing sailorâ€™s chanties & Tom Bowling. This seemed to me a very amusing & instructive spectacle; & being famished for music, I could not get past, but stood & felt thrilled with an absurd visionary excitement; & walked over Hungerford Bridge making up stories.
