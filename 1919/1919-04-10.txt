### Thursday 10 April

A great skip, how accounted for I scarcely know. Writing hard at a Times article on novels perhaps used up my desire for activity of the fingers; & then these last few days Iâ€™ve been submerged in Defoe; & only steal 10 minutes from Roxana to write this. I have to read one book a day in order to start on Saturdayâ€”such is the life of a hack. I went up to tea with Janet, & noticed the signs of age in her; gentle old ladyish smiles, & turns of speech; for her age will be a profitable season. And the Eliots, Walter & Marjorie dined here on Sunday; I amused myself by seeing how sharp, narrow, & much of a stick Eliot has come to be, since he took to disliking me. His wife a washed out, elderly & worn looking little woman, who was relieved to find Walter Lamb with his stories about the King provided for her; & indeed Walter seemed to both the ideal of manhood. Gumbo held forth in her most vivacious & commanding style. I tried to secure Faulker a nurse for Nessa & failed; went up to the Times on Monday & had an interview with Richmondâ€”a restless vivacious little man, jumping onto a chair to see the traffic over the blind, & chivvying a piece of paper round the room with his feet. He offered many suggestions about houses in Cornwall. Yesterday Desmond appeared, & told us the strange story of Elizabeth Asquith & Hugh Gibson, which I have not time to write down, but it is remarkable that 2 years ago she knew nothing of the physical side of the sexes.
