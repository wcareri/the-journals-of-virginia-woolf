### Thursday 24 April

On Easter Monday we went up to visit the Murrys & see Hampstead Heath. Our verdict was that the crowd at close quarters is detestable; it smells; it sticks; it has neither vitality nor colour; it is a tepid mass of flesh scarcely organised into human life. How slow they walk! How passively & brutishly they lie on the grass! How little of pleasure or pain is in them! But they looked well dressed & well fed; & at a distance among the canary coloured swings & roundabouts they had the look of a picture. It was a summers dayâ€”in the sun at least; we could sit on a mound & look at the little distant trickle of human beings eddying round the chief centres of gaiety & filing over the heath & spotted upon its humps. Very little noise they made; the large aeroplane that came flying so steadily over head made more noise than the whole crowd of us. Why do I say â€˜usâ€™? I never for a moment felt myself one of â€˜themâ€™. Yet the sight had its charm: I liked the bladders, & the little penny sticks, & the sight of two slow elaborate dancers performing to a barrel organ in a space the size of a hearthrug. Katherine & Murry & Murryâ€™s brother met us at their door. We thought she would have enjoyed herself, from the likeness of her prose to the scene; on the contrary, she was disgusted. We had rather a stiff tea. Murryâ€™s brother is a bumpkin; & the Rhodesian woman under a cloud of lacerated feelings I suppose; Katherine haggard & powdered; & so on. But it was no oneâ€™s fault; & their talk of Tregerthen combined with the image of it on a hot day made us determine to take it here & now. We have written to this effect to Captain Short. I try not to hope, since I feel sure we shall be disappointed.

â€œLet it three days agoâ€ or no answer at all; that is what I imagine.

Last night the Coles dined here, & gave me my first view of them. Sharp, positive, hard minds; in tense taut bodies; in Coleâ€™s case the mouth seems fixed in a kind of snarl at the world. A positive domineering young man he seemed; & she, with less force, equally sure of herself. A good laugh would do them both good; yet how laugh with those tight stretched drums for cheeks, & those curled sneering lips? I donâ€™t accuse either of them of a desire to be savage or destructive: I write from the outsiders unsympathetic point of view. But Leonard, though he works at their works, is still humane & deliberate. Its the perpetual strife that strings them up in this way, I think; no speculative or contemplative or imaginative power seems to be left them. And whatâ€™s it all for? Who gains, even if they do win their victories. But I fancy that Mrs Cole is not a very clever woman; & such wits as she has use up all their force in keeping nimble. She has nothing left over to play with. This I write from the recollection of them which came to me on waking. â€œI dont like the Colesâ€ I said to myself, before I had time to set my faculties to work upon this judgment.

Tomorrow we go down to Asheham for 10 days; alone; leaving the servants to clean here, & intending to find a house for Â£35 if we can, for that is our solution at present. The weather has gone to pieces; the image is a true one; it is much as if some serenely sailing ship had been wrecked on a splinter of rock & left only tatters & spars to be tossed in a swelter of grey sea.
