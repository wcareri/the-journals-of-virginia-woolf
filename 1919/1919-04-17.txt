We saw the magnolia tree in blossom next day with the Minister for Education himself. He is a strange mixture of ascetic & worldling. The lean secluded man now finds himself dazzled by office, & with all his learning & culture swept away by men of vitality & affairs. Such a tribute as he paid to Winston Churchill might have been paid by some dazzled moth to a lamp. He seems to see nothing clearly, or else some notion of responsibility forbids him to say what he thinks. He hums & haws when asked a plain question & murmurs on in a husky sort of whisper which seems bodiless & blurred as himself. His whole aspect is that of a worn & half obliterated scholar made spruce by tailors & doing his best to adopt the quiet distinguished manner of those who govern. This is his official side. In private he is a kindly, even affectionate gentleman, simple by nature, though tarnished either by Oxford or by his Fisher blood with a supercilious superficial manner which leads him to dally urbanely & in a way which belittles them with art & letters & everything but politics. This used to irritateâ€”now it merely amuses me. He has long passed the shadow line, & his sarcasms seem directed at phantoms. All clever official men, even poor old Goldie, seem smoothed out of likeness to humanity; & impelled to babble on glibly & entertainingly as if they were under a perpetual contract to keep the high table amused. I do H.A.L.F. the credit to say that he does not give himself airs, save those of a person rendered responsible through no particular merit of his own. We took him to Kew, & chatted of Oxford & Walter Pater, & how Chesterton is a genius, & George Moore another, by way of relief from politics. And he approved of nature too, & likened the Thames beneath a shower to a picture in the Louvre. He stood still on the bank for some minutes, taking in the impression, not as a person who is accustomed to looking at things looks, but rather as a man who collects objects for the good of his soul. So it was too with the buds of the magnolia at Kew.

We had Oliver & Inez to dinner. As one of the couples they must be linked together thus. What binds him to her I did not find it easy to see. Animation perhaps, a kind of brisk professional manner, & it appears that she had read modern poetry & can deliver her opinions as if they were her own. Iâ€™m a little doubtful, when I find a cheap ready made young woman out of an office in Oxford Street & lodging at Harrow, enthusiastic about Robinson Crusoe; nor do I attribute it wholly to my intellectual snobbery. Her face, unlike the faces of all the other Cropheads, seemed to me vulgar, & unpleasant. One must remember though that Oliver is now verging upon 50; a little grey at the temples; abrupt & inclined to be snappish; so that his choice is not so wide as it was. However one may abuse the Stracheys their minds remain a source of joy to the end; so sparkling, definite & nimble. Need I add that I reserve the qualities I most admire for people who are not Stracheys? It is so long since I have seen Lytton that I take my impression of him too much from his writing, & his paper upon Lady Hester Stanhope was not one of his best. I could fill this page with gossip about peopleâ€™s articles in the Athenaeum; since I had tea with Katherine yesterday & Murry sat there mud-coloured & mute, livening only when we talked his shop. He has the jealous partiality of a parent for his offspring already. I tried to be honest, as if honesty were part of my philosophy, & said how I disliked Grantorto on whistling birds, & Lytton & so on. The male atmosphere is disconcerting to me. Do they distrust one? despise one? & if so why do they sit on the whole length of oneâ€™s visit? The truth is that when Murry says the orthodox masculine thing about Eliot for example, belittling my solicitude to know what he said of me, I dont knuckle under; I think what an abrupt precipice cleaves asunder the male intelligence, & how they pride themselves upon a point of view which much resembles stupidity. I find it much easier to talk to Katherine; she gives & resists as I expect her to; we cover more ground in much less time; but I respect Murry. I wish for his good opinion. Heinemann has rejected K.M.â€™s stories; & she was oddly hurt that Roger had not invited her to his party. Her hard composure is much on the surface.
