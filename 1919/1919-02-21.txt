### Friday 21 February

But all this is made to appear rather fine drawn & exaggerated by the simple fact that I have a letter this morning from K.M. herself asking me to tea on Monday & explaining how some new treatment gives her fever for two days & makes it impossible for her to see people. Also I am asked to write for the Athenaeum, so that little scratch in my vanity is healed. Not that I want to review any more books than come my way already. But owing to my laborious, & it appears rather misleading, accounts of my friends life has been too much neglected. Let me recollect. On Sunday last Saxon & Barbara dined here; but did little more than dine, since she had to return to feed her baby. She came frisking into the room; but her mind is a sedate literal mind; the pity is that she cant always be in a state of bodily frisk. That is her natural element, Iâ€™m sure; to expect quiet talk is against nature. Saxon watches her, judging I suppose that her charms provide for them both. I let myself in for a visit to Faithâ€™s; a tea, to see the Baby. Faith will shortly add to the race herself. A discontent is roused in me at this proceeding on her part. Iâ€™m a human being myself; I scarcely feel that Faith will do us credit. She is a lax satirical woman, finding sharp things to say, & already at 28 possessed of a grievance. There she lounges over her fire arranging little mosaic patterns of all of us in a peevish way, & making it appear that she has no other interest in life. One feels her mind a very magpies larder of gossip. Oh yes, she knew of my meeting with Hope Mirrlees; & informed me that she supposed I was one of those unstable friends, rejoicing in quarrels. She had apparently given the matter some thought. In contrast to her Barbara was â€˜very niceâ€™; direct, unaffected, sympathetic, as far as her wits will carry her; & in some queer fashion of her own a personality. I wonder what this rises from. On the doorstep in the dark she hinted her concern for poor old Saxon. And then Saxon rang me up to apologise for not staying longer, & suggest another visit.
