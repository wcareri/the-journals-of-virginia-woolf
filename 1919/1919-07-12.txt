### Saturday 12 July

In public affairs, I see Iâ€™ve forgotten to say that peace was signed; perhaps that ceremony was accomplished while we were at Asheham. Iâ€™ve forgotten the account I was going to write out of the gradual disappearance of things from shop windows; & the gradual, but still only partial reappearance of things. Sugar cakes, currant buns, & mounds of sweets. The effect of the war would be worth describing, & one of these days at Monks Houseâ€”but why do I let myself imagine spaces of leisure at Monks House? I know I shall have books that must be read there too, just as here & now I should be reading Herman Melville, & Thomas Hardy, not to say Sophocles, if Iâ€™m to finish the Ajax, as I wager myself to do, before August. But this dressing up of the future is one of the chief sources of our happiness, I believe. Thereâ€™s still a good deal of the immediate past asserting its claim on me. I met Morgan Forster on the platform at Waterloo yesterday; a man physically resembling a blue butterflyâ€”I mean by that to describe his transparency & lightness. He had been conveying the luggage of 5 Indians from Deptford to Waterloo; Indians seemed to weigh him down. We exchanged compliments on our writingâ€”Iâ€™m surprised to find him openly liking a compliment, though its nothing strange in myself; & discussed Altounyanâ€™s work a little. He did not at all care for it; no form, no character; no one figure dominating the others. I like Forster very much, though I find him whimsical & vagulous to an extent that frightens me with my own clumsiness & definiteness. Then I bought my bag of coffee, & so up to Katherine, with whom I spent my hour very happily. Indeed, I like her more & more; & think we have reached some kind of durable foundation. Home to a dinner party consisting of the two Altounyans, Ernest & Norah, Carrington (the male), & Herbert Woolf after dinner. Poor scatterbrained A. showed the least pleasant side of himself in discussing his novel, which he does not merely with passion but with a conceit that would be irritating if it werenâ€™t transparently foolish. His only anxiety is to find how many people are capable of understanding him; about the merits of his work he has no doubt, & cut short my laborious critical survey of them. Rather coolly, he proposed that we should be his agents, finding publishers for all his works for ever. This is all rather foreign; as I found it foreign, though pleasantly foreign of him, to tell me how many people had wished to marry his sisterâ€”â€œFor she wishes very much to be married.â€ â€œYesâ€ she said simply, â€œif one hasnâ€™t a profession, one must marry; one must look after someone.â€ I liked her better than I like him. As for Carrington, he will be a very popular man in the East.
