### Friday 16 May

These swarming hot summer days seem to quicken human life as well as vegetable. One becomes a flower oozing honey upon which ones friends clusterâ€”or such is my version of the relationship. This week weâ€™ve had Ottoline, & Lytton, & Iâ€™ve been to see Violet Dickinson, & tonight the Abrahamsons & Oliver Strachey dine with us; on Saturday Logan comes to tea; on Sunday we lunch with the Webbs, to say nothing of invitations weâ€™ve refused, & leaving out a great squash at the 17 Club to hear Forster speak on Egypt, when we met Bob, Altounyan, & Dora Sanger, with the usual varieties of old friends. As usual my mind is too crammed to sift all these wares. Let me attempt Ottoline, since her hat & veil on the sofa beside me recall her. She was, I think L. was right in saying, anxious to come out & inspect us. She struck her unmistakable note on entering the room; rayed with green & blue, like the Cornish sea, & magnificently upright & held together; her blue blood giving her the carriage of assurance & self-respect which is rare among the intellectuals. We have taken, this last week, to dining in the garden, & there we sat on the flawless summer night with the apple trees softly snowed under with blossom, & a moon up. Certain layers of powder showed upon the steeps of her faceâ€”but when you reflect that sheâ€™s close on 50â€”& has cropped her hair like a boy! Of course we talked personalities; investigated the case of Mary Hutch. & Eliot; also Gertler; & she was apparently, & as I believe, genuinely, kindly, & well wishing, though considerably bewildered, & bewailing as usual her disasters in friendship, & inclined to blame everyone but herself, though anxious for reconciliations, & plantive rather than bitter. Lâ€™s verdict was that she was â€œvery niceâ€; the first time he has ever said that. The qualities which one has glimpses of in company were steadily visible in this domestic evening, when there was nothing to stimulate, & no effort to rise to.

Her intuitions are more penetrating than many of the profoundly reasonable remarks of our intellectuals; & to me she always has the pathos of a creature vaguely afloat in some wide open space, without support or clear knowledge of its direction. Perhaps she was on her good behaviourâ€”but if so, she was capable of wrapping herself in her great Spanish cloak, & sallying out into the street without her hat; sheâ€™s altogether such a fancy dress character that a hat more or less seems immaterial. We put her into her train with young officers who looked up startled; & despatched her to Waterloo.

Next day there was Lytton. I need not repeat the stock observations upon his mellow good humour. It is more to the point to chronicle a renewed sense of affection, which has never been seriously in abeyance, & the usual conviction that his wit & what one calls personality are as peculiar to himself as his voice, or his finger nails. And then one thinks that it doesnâ€™t much matter if his writing is not profound or original; one begins perhaps to suspect that it may be more original than one thinks. He tells his stories of Cunards & Winston & Lord Ribblesdale admirably; with Marjorieâ€™s dramatic talent, & with a finer power of observation. We scrutinised the condition of his soul, with his help, very closely. Ottoline had professed some alarm, We came to the conclusion that it would be absurd not to have this butterflyâ€™s season among the great. The comparison between him & the select Norton, Alix, & James seemed entirely in his favour. The touchstone of virtue with them now is whether you attend Bertieâ€™s lectures or not. I hereby vow to fuddle Alix completely. We sat on the river bank, & he told us of a visit to Irene Vanbrugh, with his comedy; how the singing of her canary birds almost drowned his voice; & how finally she determined against it, finding a lack of human passion. Therefore the comedy is shelved, for ever, I suspect, & he writes, & will continue to write Eminent Victorians.

Perhaps there was a little melancholy at this confession; perhaps a little desire for commendation of Lady Hester Stanhope, which we withheld; or perhaps I judge other writersâ€™ craving for applause by my own. Iâ€™ve had Rogerâ€™s praise of Kew Gardens by the way, so I suppose Iâ€™m still safe, though no longer greeted with such exciting raptures. Indeed the books sell very slowly; & it looks as though the market for such commodities is a small oneâ€”infinitesimal; we shanâ€™t even pay our expenses it seems. But with such a variety of matter to choose from, this can scarcely be the fault of the books themselves; it was novelty that sold them at first. I broke from Lytton with regret, & paid my visit to Violet; but she would have been hurt had I shirked it, to judge at least by her pleasure at seeing me. Its odd how people of 50 remain exactly 50. She hasnâ€™t changed a hair for 20 years, which must be the length of our friendship. We take things up precisely as we left them; a years gap makes no difference; we have had our intimacy; something or other has fused; & never hardens again. Thus I felt in talking to her; it was the usual inconsequent, generous minded, unselfish talk. When I come onto the verge of the respectable classes Iâ€™m always struck by their unexpectedness: V. is as much of a democrat as I am; as little of an Imperialist; she blames England; she has no hate of Germany; she sends clothes to Russia; & yet she lives in Manchester Street, consorts chiefly with people like the Horners & the Thynnes, & has Ozzie for a brother. Beatrice Thynne has inherited a quarter of a million; two large properties, & one of the finest libraries in England; she has no idea what to make of them; visits them in a distracted way to see which sheâ€™d like to live in; canâ€™t make up her mind to settle in either, & finally spends most of her time in Grayâ€™s Inn, looked after by a charwoman. Her only acknowledgement of her balance is that now & then she pulls out strings of pearls, & parades the Squares of the Inn, with such effect that Lady H. Somerset has to beg her to remove them.
