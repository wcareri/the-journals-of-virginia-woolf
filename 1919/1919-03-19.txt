Life piles up so fast that I have no time to write out the equally fast rising mound of reflections, which I always mark down as they rise to be inserted here. I meant to write about the Barnetts, & the peculiar repulsiveness of those who dabble their fingers self approvingly in the stuff of othersâ€™ souls. The Barnetts were at any rate plunged to the elbow; red handed if ever philanthropists were, which makes them good examples; & then, unquestioning & unspeculative as they were, they give themselves away almost to the undoing of my critical faculty. Is it chiefly intellectual snobbery that makes me dislike them?â€”is it snobbery to feel outraged when she says â€œThen I came close to the Great Gatesâ€â€”or reflects that God = good, devil = evil. Has this coarseness of grain any necessary connection with labour for oneâ€™s kind? And then the smug vigour of their self-satisfaction! Never a question as to the right of what they doâ€”always a kind of insensate forging ahead until, naturally, their undertakings are all of colossal size & portentous prosperity. Moreover, could any woman of humour or insight quote such paeans to her own genius? Perhaps the root of it all lies in the adulation of the uneducated, & the easy mastery of the will over the poor. And more & more I come to loathe any dominion of one over another; any leadership, any imposition of the will. Finally, my literary taste is outraged by the smooth way in which the tale is made to unfold into full blown success, like some profuse peony. But I only scratch the surface of what I feel about these two stout volumes.

On Monday after many failures I met Murry at the Club & we had our talk about the Athenaeum. Success has already begun to do for Murry what I always said it would do. He is more freshly coloured, even in the cheeks, than when we last met; & his mind has its high lights. Why, he chuckled like a schoolboy; his eyes shone; his silences were occupied with pleasant thoughts, I think; not that he would admit that to edit the Athenaeum was much more than preferable to a place in a government office. He talked so much about his plans, & with such zest that we sat there from 4.45 to 6.30, or past, & I had to rush. In fact I only caught my train owing to my skill as a psychologist. We were discussing his poetry, & his standing as a poet, with some intensity on his part, so that he lay back, & looked very intently at the ceiling. I was interested but guilty about dinner waiting. So I said â€œYes, its true writing for oneâ€™s own press is very pleasantâ€”Now next week I have to take my novel to Gerald Duckworthâ€”â€ â€œAhâ€ his eyes came down from the ceiling at once. â€œWhatâ€™s it called?â€”Oh yesâ€”itâ€™ll be out in the autumn I suppose. Well, dâ€™you know Iâ€™m afraid I must be going.â€

Murry is much of a small boy still, I think, in spite of his tragic airs. I suspect his boast will come true; the Athenaeum will be the best literary paper in existence in 12 months.

â€œWhat will you write Virginia?â€ he asked. Am I too modest in thinking that there was a shade of the perfunctory in the question? Anyhow I didnâ€™t persecute him with any degree of pressure. I offered to look in on Thursdays sometimes & get a book; sometimes to suggest an article; he agreed quite cordially. We went over all his names, & tried to think of others, but agreed that once our intimate friends were gone through the field was mown of its poppies. The younger generation promises very little so far. An editor naturally sweeps the young writers very carefully. I doubt that I was so much of an incubus to Richmond as I thought. While we were demurring a little to the idea of James as dramatic critic, the dramatic critic looked in & saw us. I recommended Desmond for the star part. Katherine will do 4 novels every weekâ€”pray to God she donâ€™t do mine! I feel the acid in her once moreâ€”since she doesnt take the trouble to write a card to fix an engagement; but I shall try to go up there tomorrow & judge the situation with my own eyes. Today we finished printing Eliotâ€™s poemsâ€”our best work so far by a long way, owing to the quality of the ink. MacDermott has done Murryâ€™s poem with such blots & blurs that we must at any rate reprint the title page.
