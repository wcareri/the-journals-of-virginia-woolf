### Saturday 19 July

One ought to say something about Peace day, I suppose, though whether its worth taking a new nib for that purpose I dont know. Iâ€™m sitting wedged into the window, & so catch almost on my head the steady drip of rain which is pattering on the leaves. In ten minutes or so the Richmond procession begins. I fear there will be few people to applaud the town councillors dressed up to look dignified & march through the streets. Iâ€™ve a sense of holland covers on the chairs; of being left behind when everyoneâ€™s in the country. Iâ€™m desolate, dusty, & disillusioned. Of course we did not see the procession. We have only marked the rim of refuse on the outskirts. Rain held off till some half hour ago. The servants had a triumphant morning. They stood on Vauxhall Bridge & saw everything. Generals & soldiers & tanks & nurses & bands took 2 hours in passing. It was they said the most splendid sight of their lives. Together with the Zeppelin raid it will play a great part in the history of the Boxall family. But I donâ€™t knowâ€”it seems to me a servants festival; some thing got up to pacify & placate â€˜the peopleâ€™â€”& now the rainâ€™s spoiling it; & perhaps some extra treat will have to be devised for them. Thats the reason of my disillusionment I think. Thereâ€™s something calculated & politic & insincere about these peace rejoicings. Moreover they are carried out with no beauty, & not much spontaneity. Flags are intermittent; we have what the servants, out of snobbishness, I think, insisted upon buying, to surprise us. Yesterday in London the usual sticky stodgy conglomerations of people, sleepy & torpid as a cluster of drenched bees, were crawling over Trafalgar Square, & rocking about the pavements in the neighbourhood. The one pleasant sight I saw was due rather to the little breath of wind than to decorative skill; some long tongue shaped streamers attached to the top of the Nelson column licked the air, furled & unfurled, like the gigantic tongues of dragons, with a slow, rather serpentine beauty. Otherwise theatres & music halls were studded with stout glass pincushions which, rather prematurely, were all radiant withinâ€”but surely light might have shone to better advantage. However night was sultry & magnificent so far as that went, & we were kept awake some time after getting into bed by the explosion of rockets which for a second made our room bright. (And now, in the rain, under a grey brown sky, the bells of Richmond are ringingâ€”but church bells only recall weddings & Christian services.) I canâ€™t deny that I feel a little mean at writing so lugubriously; since weâ€™re all supposed to keep up the belief that weâ€™re glad & enjoying ourselves. So on a birthday, when for some reason things have gone wrong, it was a point of honour in the nursery to pretend. Years later one could confess what a horrid fraud it seemed; & if, years later, these docile herds will own up that they too saw through it, & will have no more of itâ€”wellâ€”should I be more cheerful? I think the dinner at the 1917 Club, & Mrs Besantâ€™s speech rubbed the gilt, if there were any grains remaining, effectually off the gingerbread. Hobson was sardonic. Sheâ€”a massive, & sulky featured old lady, with a capacious head, however, thickly covered with curly white hair,â€”began by comparing London, lit up & festive, with Lahore. And then she pitched into us for our maltreatment of India, she, apparently, being â€˜themâ€™ & not â€˜usâ€™. But I donâ€™t think she made her case very solid, though superficially it was all believable, & the 1917 Club applauded & agreed. I cant help listening to speaking as though it were writing, & thus the flowers, which she brandished now & again, looked terribly artificial. It seems to me more & more clear that the only honest people are the artists, & that these social reformers & philanthropists get so out of hand, & harbour so many discreditable desires under the disguise of loving their kind, that in the end thereâ€™s more to find fault with in them than in us. But if I were one of them?
