### Sunday 21 September

Why should I pick out the one hour of the week when Church bells jangle to go on with this? A cold bright Sunday; very easy today to remember the feel of winter,â€”even the look of the winter earth. Yesterday, as I sat reading, Nick came knocking at the door. I had put away his letter unanswered, also, apparently, unread. We had to make ready a room, & prepare a crab, which he brought as offering. He seemed singularly featureless, rather like those chubby little village boys one sees with rosy cheeks & red ears staring in at sweet shop windows. This is I think much his real character, but superimposed is a dab of culture, taking the safe direction of 18th century literature & art. â€œThomas Gray knew how to write letters from the countryâ€”very witty interesting lettersâ€”Have you ever read Thomas Gray?â€ Then Jane Austen appears. She is his great fan. As for apples & pears, which are now his business, his knowledge is limited; or perhaps it is due to his thin soiled brain that words are very poverty sticken, ideas seem to crawl. Looking up, I saw his face alongside L.â€™s; & they looked samples of different breeds, or widely spaced stages of development. â€œHere, the professor might say, pointing his stick at Nick, is a type of primitive manâ€”man yet incapable of concentration or foresightâ€”â€ Whereas hereâ€”well, his remarks upon L. would be highly complimentary. In spite of this grudging scrape of my pen, I liked Nick quite enough to enjoy seeing him; & having a practical, & perhaps, trained mind, we pumped him a good deal about the house. He cannot see a cupboard without discovering how it has been built in, or a pipe without running his finger along, or a brick without lifting it to pryâ  out possible secrets of building. He advises as to ask Hopeâ€™s advice. Barbara arrived for lunch, in breeches & jersey, scarlet as an apple but maternal, to my eye, & with her vivid little edge of character distinguishing her from the rest of them. She is considerably more distinguished than Nick, & he recognises this abundantly. Perhaps his pride is blown upon by the covetous eyes of Saxon. Anyhow, he thinks B. a most remarkable character, stamped with the precious mark of Gordon Squareâ€™s approval. O dearâ€”when will that mark be rubbed out? Yet itâ€™s vain talking. What would it profit me to gain the praise of the whole world & lose that single voice? This reflection is due in part to the Memoirs of Mrs Humphry Ward. By paying 5/ I have become a member of the Lewes public library. It is an amusing placeâ€”full of old ghosts; books half way to decomposition. A general brownness covers them. They are as much alike outwardly as charity schoolchildren. Most have shed their boards years ago, & been recovered in brown paper. There is no reason, either, why Mungo Park should not be succeeded by the Sermons of Ebenezer Howard, & then Lord Morleyâ€™s Recollections, & then White Wings, or a Swallowâ€™s Summer, & then Treasures of the Deep. Thats the sort of thing anyhow I could not resist Mrs Ward, & I stand in her unconscionably long hours, as if she were a bath of tepid water that one lacks the courage to leave. But she set me thinking after tea about fame. No one has had a deeper draught of it. The poor woman, now conscious of a little chill, brings out her old praises & hangs them out of her front windows. â€œSee what Henry James said of meâ€”Walter Paterâ€”George Meredith.â€ And indeed these poor old grandees, solicited I suppose by presentation copies & the rest, do seem to have perjured themselves cheerfully, though I can see them winking. My point is however, that all this blare & pomp has no kind of effect upon the sensitive reader, as I claim to be. Perhaps the winks are too evident. The enormous sales, the American editions, the rumble & reverberationâ€”Piccadilly placarded with posters â€˜Marcella out!â€™â€”seem like the drum & cymbals of a country fair. No, nothing of this countsâ€”She herself, setting out to write an intimate account of feelings & thoughts, gives nothing but bills of fare & pass books. At what point did she cease thinking? Long Long ago, I should say; & then came to believe implicitly in the mummery: names of the great serve as umbrellas covering vacancy. But all tea table talk to admonish the young, who are, I suppose, now becoming inquisitive & objectionable. What a picture though of the highest life in intellectual circles in London! What a portrait of the Servants Hall; with Mrs H. W. for housekeeper, & Uncle Matt, the master. A Detestable assembly, as she paints it. Literature served up on plate before them. I have Gosse to review, which makes me rig up some fancy scene as I stumble about the fields. To Rat Farm with L. this afternoon; & found a hawk moth drowned in the brookâ€”privet? or what?
