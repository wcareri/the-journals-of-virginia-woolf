### Sunday 25 May

The day recalls the fact that we lunched with the Webbs this time last week. I have made no note of it. There was the weak distinguished looking & yet vaguely apologetic Noel Buxton; & Arnott, rather self assertive, on the contrary, owing everything to his wits, & without an ounce of distinction thrown in. I cannot get over my distaste for the Fabian type; though if it came to spending a year on a desert island, I suppose I should choose him rather than Buxton. I donâ€™t know. The Webbs were very quotable. Mrs Webbâ€™s brilliant idea of municipal bricks for children, inscribed with the names of organisations so that in putting them together they would learn their civic duties was almost too much in character to be suitable. Even Sidney had his mild joke at her. Noel Buxton obsequiously offered his son for the experiment. Rich men nowadays can be seen divesting themselves of particles of gold with a view to the eye of the needle. Then later in the week Mrs Woolf & Sylvia came to tea, bringing fresh eggs & lilies of the valley. Sylvia amused me by her assurance that the affairs of Putney are of moment to the world; & her anxiety to get stories of her own house hunting adventures correctedâ€”as though these were matters of importance. And Mrs Woolf, as usual, pleased me by her childishness, by which I mean her freshness & inconsequence, as if all her life were still spent among the little incidents & goings on of a large nursery. She couldnâ€™t face a play, she told me; but she could just manage lunch at the Carlton. Why the boundary line between the impossible comes there I donâ€™t know. And Bella since Bertieâ€™s death finds life necessary to keep up her spirits; & is learning to Jazz; & her eyes prevent her from reading much; but she writes her page in Little Folks; & her friends are all very good to her, & she has gone to Bexhill with Martin & Emma. It is predicted that Martin will be made not quite a knight but the next best thing. Martin believes in orders, I gather, & our laughter at the O.B.E. must have saddened him the other night. Philip is cutting off lambsâ€™ tails, & they are made into a pie at nightâ€”Philip who would step aside to avoid a caterpillar, & once fought Harold for using worms for bait, & was chased by Harold to the next village in the Isle of Wight where they were staying â€œ& I ran after them, miles & miles, thinking that the end of the world had come!â€ Naturally Mrs Woolf had no time to read Sophoclesâ€”nor have I for the matter of that.

Lytton came to tea on Friday & half maliciously assured me that my industry amazed him. My industry & my competence, for he thinks me the best reviewer alive, & the inventor of a new prose style, & the creator of a new version of the sentence. Peopleâ€™s compliments generally manage to reserve the particular praise they wish to have themselves. But we are surprisingly honest; we have a clear perception of the others meaning. He asserted that he was disgusted by his own stereotyped ways: his two semi colons; his method of understatement; & his extreme definiteness. Without agreeing, I conveyed my sense of his dangers, & urged him to write playsâ€”storiesâ€”anything to break the mould of the early Victorians. After a volume on Victoria, in the same manner, he is going to attempt it. But then moneyâ€”he must make moneyâ€”he cant write reviewsâ€”& Iâ€™ve to do Addison, & other books, & protested that all the same Iâ€™m not a hack, & he runs the risk of becoming a Logan, a superior dilettante. To which he agreed, & then we talked about Addison, & read scraps of Johnsonâ€™s lives; & so enjoyed ourselves. He told me about Princess Sophia & the d. of Cumberland.

To the Squireâ€™s party.
