### Wednesday 5 March

Just back from 4 days at Asheham, & one at Charleston; I sit waiting for Leonard to come in, with a brain still running along the railway lines, which unfits it for reading. But oh, dear, what a lot Iâ€™ve got to read! The entire works of Mr James Joyce, Wyndham Lewis, Ezra Pound, so as to compare them with the entire works of Dickens & Mrs Gaskell; besides that George Eliot; & finally Hardy. And Iâ€™ve just done Aunt Anny, on a really liberal scale. Yes, since I wrote last she has died, a week ago today to be precise, at Freshwater, & was buried up at Hampstead yesterday where 6 or 7 years ago we saw Richmond buried in a yellow fog. I suppose my feeling for her is half moonshine; or rather half reflected from other feelings. Father cared for her; she goes down the last, almost, of that old 19th Century Hyde Park Gate world. Unlike most old ladies she showed very little anxiety to see one; felt, I sometimes think, a little painfully at the sight of us, as if weâ€™d gone far off, & recalled unhappiness, which she never liked to dwell on. Also, unlike most old Aunts she had the wits to feel how sharply we differed on current questions; & this, perhaps, gave her a sense, hardly existing with her usual circle, of age, obsoleteness, extinction. For myself, though, she need have had no anxieties on this head, since I admired her sincerely; but still the generations certainly look very different ways. Two or perhaps three years ago L. & I went to see her; found her much diminished in size, wearing a feather boa round her neck, and seated alone in a drawing room almost the copy, on a smaller scale, of the old drawing room; the same subdued pleasant air of the 18th Century & old portraits & old china. She had our tea waiting for us. Her manner was a little distant, & more than a little melancholy. I asked her about father, & she said how those young men laughed in a â€œloud melancholy wayâ€ & how their generation was a very happy one, but selfish; & how ours seemed to her fine but very terrible; but we hadnâ€™t any writers such as they had. â€œSome of them have just a touch of that quality; Bernard Shaw has; but only a touch. The pleasant thing was to know them all as ordinary people, not great menâ€”â€ And then a story of Carlyle & father; Carlyle saying heâ€™d as soon wash his face in a dirty puddle as write journalism. She put her hand down I remember, into a bag or box standing behind the fire, & said she had a novel, three-quarters writtenâ€”but couldnâ€™t finish itâ€”nor do I suppose it ever was finished, but Iâ€™ve said all I can say, dressing it up a trifle rosily, in the Times tomorrow. I have written to Hester, but how I doubt the sincerity of my own emotions!

Asheham was, I suppose, a qualified success onlyâ€”at any rate for L. because of the discomfort; for me the discomfort such as it was was chiefly due to Philip's presence. One couldnâ€™t sink back before the log fire & read Shakespeare. That form of exalted egotism was checked, & I think perhaps Philip felt himself a little of a hindrance, as no doubt, he always feels himself nowâ€”an outsider, a spectator; unattached & very lonely. Duncan came over involved in domestic difficulties, & gave him a letter to Mr Hecks the farmer, which he was to deliver yesterday morning, in the worst downpour of the year. But we had two lovely afternoons of spring, when I kept asking myself â€œNow where are we? What point have we reached? Is this spring or September?â€ waking with a start to the fact that we are launched on another summer. Those little grey green tassels were decorating the woods, like the design on a Japanese screen. Starting out to fetch milk on one of these days we met Gunn & heard our fate. Weâ€™re to go in September. He wants Asheham to live in with his old mother. Oh dear Oh dear!â€”Each time I walked up the drive I thoughâ t how nothing was ever so perfect. If it werenâ€™t for the devil of starting something new in me, I should be in despair. L. thinks it easy to make a fetish of a house; which is true; meanwhile we hang suspended. But the need of looking for another house is a source of great pleasure. It drove us all along the Rodmell Road to Mr Staceyâ€™s & there we heard from a pair of drab females in a chaise that Mr Robinson of Iford is going to let; so on we went, to Iford, a thickly set little village on the plain; & found a house with three green columns, a stuffed up drawing room, & a Mrs Robinson, made so L. declared & the number of her children attested, for breeding purposes. Art lamps & iridescent plates attached to the wall demonstrated the gentility of her farmer husband. Evidently they have made themselves very snug, & will want more than we can pay; even if the country there were better than it is. On the whole we incline to aim at Itford farm houseâ€”a house that could be made very attractive, with its view & its sun. We have grown out of gentlemenâ€™s houses.

Charleston is by no means a gentlemanâ€™s house. I bicycled round there in a flood of rain, & found the baby asleep in its cot, & Nessa & Duncan sitting over the fire, with bottles & bibs & basins all round them. Duncan went to make my bed. Their staff at this moment consists simply of Jenny, the sharp Jewish looking cook; & she having collapsed, spent the afternoon in bed. By extreme method & unselfishness & routine on Nessaâ€™s & Duncanâ€™s parts chiefly, the dinner is cooked, & innumerable refills of hotwater bottles & baths supplied. One has the feeling of living on the brink of a move. In one of the little islands of comparative order Duncan set up his canvas, & Bunny wrote a novel in a set of copy books. Nessa scarcely leaves the babies room, or if she appears for a moment outside, she has instantly to go off & talk to Dan, Jennyâ€™s young man & the future support of Charleston, or to wash napkins, or bottles, or prepare meals. Mrs B. & the children run rapidly to & fro between their rooms. I had an immense long talk with Ann about the health of the Persian cat, which, according to Mrs B. was fatally injured internally while being washed to cure it of nits; so that she demanded chloroform, which Nessa refused, & the cat recovered. Then Quentin had just been suspected of measlesâ€”The atmosphere seems full of catastrophes which upset no one; the atmosphere is good humoured, lively, as it tends to be after three months of domestic disaster. In these circumstances, I daresay I had no more than 30 minutes consecutive talk with Nessa, chiefly devoted to the great epic of the Dr the nurse & Emily. But as happens after disaster upon disaster a sudden lightening of calamity appeared this morning: Dan & his mother being engaged, a letter then arrived from a nurse who against all probability seems to wish to come if she may bring a friend. But I broke off in full tide, & had to trudge through mud to Glyndeâ€”such mud that when I went into Powell, the land agent, the sleek little clerk looked from my head to my boots in expostulationâ€”as if such a figure couldnâ€™t possibly require a house with 7 bedrooms & a bathroom. Unhappily there seems little chance of finding one. Iâ€™ve said nothing of my niece, who must be called so formally, since theyâ€™ve cancelled Susanna Paula, & can think of nothing else. She is a wistful, patient, contemplative little creature, examining the fire very meditatively, with a resigned expression, & very large blue eyes. I suppose not much larger than a big hare, though perfectly formedâ€”legs, thighs, fingers & toesâ€”both fingers & toes very long & sensitive.
