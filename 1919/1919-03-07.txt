### Friday 7 March

Having smashed my ink pot, I have recourse to safety pots again & purple ink I see dwells in this one; but I canâ€™t use with any effect the muffled respectability of a fountain pen.

Yesterday I had a tooth out, to which the bag of a large abscess had attached itself. Harrison showed it me, previous to putting it in the fire; a token of much pain he said. The queer little excursion into the dark world of gas always interests me. I came home in the Tube wondering whether any of the people there suspected its existence. I wake from it, or seem rather to step out of it & leave it to go on hurtling through space while the World of Harrison & Dr Trueby engages my attentionâ€”â€œOpen your mouth, Mrs Woolfâ€”Now let me take out this little bit of wood.â€ Suppose one woke instead to find the deity himself by oneâ€™s side! The Christians believe it, I suppose. L. has met an immense number of people these last few days; & I should have told how Sidney Webb finds his book a most remarkable piece of work, & how it is to be printed directly by Clark of Edinburgh, & will be out, perhaps, by June. And my poor old sluggard, Night & Day, is to be taken in a parcel to Gerald, as soon as I can get through with these niggling, bothersome corrections. Lady Wolseley who seems a lady of the utmost distinction since she writes to the Editor of the Times in pencil, finds L.â€™s memoir of Aunt Anny â€˜most admirableâ€™, & the delicacy of his touches â€˜a proof of Genius in himâ€™. To balance this satisfactorily my article, according to B.R., is received with acclamation in the office, at home, & in my Club. The Richmonds want to take a house for April & Mayâ€”possibly we may consider letting them Asheham. If I had L.â€™s experience I could here give a little story of the Coal Commission & Lloyd George behind the scenes, as reported by Mrs Webb.
