### Sunday 30 March

I open this book today merely to note that Miss Eleanor Ormerod, destroyer of insects, promises well for Murry: should he take kindly to my first (Eccentrics: I myself rather liked it). That note being made & L. not in yet from Staines I may add that Iâ€™m writing by the clear shrewd light of the sun, though its five minutes to the half past five. Last night we changed our watches. So the winter gloom is over, for which I am half sorry, since the dark evening over the fire has its charm. Moreover, should I look out of the window I should see snow in the garden. Yesterday morning the glare of white on trees & roofs when I drew the curtains was dazzling, surmounted too by a bright blue sky, as tender as June; but falsely tender, since outside one was scourged by the bitterest east wind, & Iâ€™ve not felt so cold this winter. Cold dashed in oneâ€™s face, & whirled up ones legs is far more cruel & harassing than a still profound frost. The Almond blossom is all gone, as if it were Cinderella when the clock struck.

I went up to tea at Gordon Sqre on Friday, having first visited Spicer the paper makers in Upper Thames Street. Clive sat at tea; a little grumpy, growing bald, & now showing a forehead rather in the style of Hall Caine. Very queer, as Nessa said, we all felt, united again in that drawing room as though it were 1907 again, & yet with so complete a re-arrangement of our parts. Perhaps we are all much happier; at any rate more secure & therefore tolerant towards each other. Then on to the Club, & dinner with the Shoves & Marjorie, for whom of course we paid, since they had all come out with no money. Geraldâ€™s buttons burst off too, & his coat came unsewn; & on again across half Mayfair, discreet & semi-lit, to the Club meetingâ€”where my attention was drawn to a large picture, the Rape of the Sabines, I daresay, given by Edward Owensmith in memory of his devoted wife Elizabeth, a Christian mother who went home Feb. 1907â€”I find it impossible to keep out thoughts about all sorts of things, & found that Marjorie listened attentively; but I can give no record of what happened, save that L. was elected again, 5th.
