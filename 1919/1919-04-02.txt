### Wednesday 2 April

Yesterday I took Night & Day up to Gerald, & had a little half domestic half professional interview with him in his office. I dont like the Club manâ€™s view of literature. For one thing it breeds in me a violent desire to boast: I boasted of Nessa & Clive & Leonard; & how much money they made. Then we undid the parcel, & he liked the title, but found that Miss Maud Annesley has a book called Nights & Daysâ€”which may make difficulties with Mudies. But he was certain he would wish to publish it; & we were altogether cordial; & I noticed how his hair is every blade of it white, with some space between the blades; a very sparsely sown field. I had tea at Gordon Sqre; Shepherd, Norton, Nessa, Duncan & later Clive. The disturbing effect of the company is not so great as it was. Yet I feel that the presence of these very brightly lit brains makes things go swiftly, & without padding. And then they have different cups & saucers, & pictures on the walls, & new chair covers. Later I withdrew with Nessa, though to withdraw is very difficult owing to the regulations about coal. Much domestic talk; Lil offering herself, as it proves fruitlessly. Then dinner at the Isola Bella; talk with Clive & Duncan: Clive insisting that Eliot dislikes me, & further trying to convince us that Nessa, Roger, himself, Lytton & I are the most hated people in London; superficial, haughty, & giving ourselves airsâ€”that, I think, is the verdict against the ladies. I admit I hate not to be liked; & one of the drawbacks of Bloomsbury is that it increases my susceptibility to these shades, which are always made very visible by Clive, in so much that I own to have sulked a little under the suspicion that Murry has confided to Clive that he dislikes my article. Home to find L. in bed; a sight to restore confidence. He had dined with Bob Trevy, spoken at South Place, & performed other activities which I give no account of. I mean, he had been to the office, & the League of Nations, & the Labour party, so that between us our range was wide yesterday. Forster is back again, & said by good Dutch Bessy to be â€˜more seriousâ€™.
