### Monday 12 May

We are in the thick of our publishing season: Murry, Eliot, & myself are in the hands of the public this morning. For this reason, perhaps, I feel slightly but decidedly depressed. I read a bound copy of Kew Gardens through; having put off the evil task until it was complete. The result is vague. It seems to me slight & short; I dont see how the reading of it impressed Leonard so much. According to him it is the best short piece I have done yet; & this judgment led me to read the Mark on the Wall, & I found a good deal of fault with that. As Sydney Waterlow once said, the worst of writing is that one depends so much upon praise. I feel rather sure that I shall get none for this story; & I shall mind a little. Unpraised, I find it hard to start writing in the morning; but the dejection lasts only 30 minutes, & once I start I forget all about it. One should aim, seriously, at disregarding ups & downs; a compliment here, silence there; Murry & Eliot ordered, & not me; the central fact remains stable, which is the fact of my own pleasure in the art. And these mists of the spirit have other causes, I expect; though they are deeply hidden. There is some ebb & flow of the tide of life which accounts for it; though what produces either ebb or flow Iâ€™m not sure.

But I have written nothing here for a week, & must cramp myself even now, in order to cut some more covers. Tuesday was written down; on Friday I had tea with K.M. & Murry, with whom I now adopt a manner of motherly badinage; which is less fatiguing than the intellectual pose. He has not yet shed all the husks of clever youth. One feels him very unformed essentially, & capable of running on in an excited uneasy state about life such as I can recall in my own past. One tacitly assumed it to be a mark of genius. On Sunday Margaret & Lilian dined here; Margaret tending to be the flowing matron; she increases in size; & one can fancy her fitting a large arm chair, & reluctant to move. They seriously consider resignation. Lilian, M. whispered, is getting unfit for so much work. Poor Janet is depressed at having lost her job, & being fit for no other, & also very hard up. Indeed this is a melancholy season for them all; but J. has more than the usual shadows to depress her. I laughed to myself over the quantities of Armenians. How can one mind whether they number 4,000 or 4,000,000? The feat is beyond me.
