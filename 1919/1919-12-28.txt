### Sunday 28 December

Probably the last entry this year, & not likely to be the most articulate. Twenty two days gap to be accounted for chiefly by illness: first L.â€™s which dribbled on; then much in the same way I was attackedâ€”8 days in bed, down today on the sofa, & away to Monks House tomorrow. It was influenzaâ€”what they call a low type, but prolonged, & sponging on the head as it always does. Not much to say therefore, even if I could say it. Indeed since L. started his malarial type, weâ€™ve seen few people; & I, for the last 10 days, none at all. But Iâ€™ve read two vast volumes of the Life of Butler; & am racing through Greville Memoirsâ€”both superbly fit for illness. Butler has the effect of paring the bark off feelings: all left a little raw, but vividâ€”a lack of sap though; & a stage so thinly set as to be dull & bone dry towards the finish. Iâ€™m struck by the enormous space his â€˜fameâ€™ & books played in a life so bare of human relations. Isnâ€™t this â€˜reputationâ€™ the deepest of all masculine instincts? Almost at the end, when people began to praise, his life put forth a little flower; but too late. For such a critical & contemptuous mind, the value attached to reviews seems queer. Why, I dont think half or quarter so much of mine! But then he had indifference & silence for his lot; perhaps the most trying. It dont (the Life I mean) increase oneâ€™s respect for human nature. Here was someone I expected to admire greatly; & the pettinesses are therefore more devastating than in the case of another. Festing Jones apes him to perfection. An effective style in its way; save that it becomes too mechanical.

Here I run on, but must stop. Oh yes, Iâ€™ve enjoyed reading the past years diary, & shall keep it up. Iâ€™m amused to find how its grown a person, with almost a face of its own.

L.â€™s book not yet out; but we have six copies in advance. Negoâ tiations proceeding for the sale of Hyde Park Gate & the purchase of this & Suffield. Servants determined to stay for ever & ever. No news of the sale of N. & D. Reviews a good deal affected by Massingham, but private opinion highly pleasing to me. I see the public becomes a question. I.R. amalgamated with Contemporary, & L. to keep his office & his virgins. We think we now deserve some good luck. Yet I daresay weâ€™re the happiest couple in England.
