### Saturday 6 December

On Tuesday I lunched with the Cecils. Perhaps this is my first appearance as a small Lioness. The Bibescos wished to meet me. Lord Cranborne has a great admiration for me. Elizabeth was nicer, & less brilliant than I expected. She has the composed manners of a matron, & did not strain to say clever things. I thought her slightly nervous when we drew into the window to talk. Perhaps she does not like the womanâ€™s eye to rest upon her. She is pasty & podgy, with the eyes of currant bun, suddenly protruding with animation. But her animation is the product of a highly trained mind; a mind trained by living perpetually among more highly trained minds. â€œMemory comes to take the place of character in the oldâ€ she said, discussing Lady D. Nevill. Again, its a help to write things down; but thereâ€™s a gulf between writing & publishing. This was said, I remember, owing to my rash abuse of Lady Glenconner & Wyndham Tennant.â€”her Aunt of course. She turned round, a little uneasily, to disclaim all admiration for Lady G. I suppose she wishes to stand well with the intellectuals. Bibesco is handsome, amiable, a man rather too much of the smooth opulent world to be of particular interest, & his English is too difficult to let one get straight at him. Like all foreigners, he says serious priggish thingsâ€”â€œI prefer to believe nothing save what my reason can confirmâ€â€”or words to that effect. Lord Robert was congenial as usual, long, loose, friendly & humorous, in spite of the crucifix on his watch chain. Lord Cranbourne much of a Cecil in appearance, modest & gentle, with a long sallow face, no chin, & shiny blue coat & trousers. He had been to a lecture at the London School of Economics. I stayed talking with Nelly when the rest were goneâ€”about adders, about servants, George Eliot, & Night & Day.
