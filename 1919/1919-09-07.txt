### Sunday 7 September

I suppose this is the first day upon which I could easily sit down & write in my long suffering & by this time I hope tolerant diary. The lack of table, pen, paper, & ink or rather their dispersion into separate parts of the house was one reason; & then followed domestic crises which I had foretold, but that did not improve their quality when they came. Now the servants are at Charleston, Mr Dedman & his brother are naming apple trees in the orchard to Leonard & if I can resist getting up & joining them I may fill this page.

The move was accomplished in one day, thanks chiefly to the organisation of L. who tied all the books in lots. Two waggon loads, one leaving about ten, another at six did the job, & we managed to roost about the house somehow or other that night. Next morning those troubles began which I will not specify further; then L. had a night in London, & I, sitting down to my book in the dusk, heard a voice asking for me, & then, to my dismay, saw the lean fantatical figure of Altounyan cross the window. He had his wife & friendâ€”Montana or Fontanaâ€”outside, & I had to produce ham & coffee for them & entertain my first visitors. A. had come from London on purpose to see us; on purpose, I rather think, to discuss the eternal novel once more, & perhaps contrive to get it issued by us. Mrs Hamilton has read, & found it necessary to quote King Lear. Part of this terrific egotism may be attributed to the Armenian half of him, I think; it is not offensive; but would become intensely boring. But, unhappily, people who come all the way from London & walk 10 miles for the chance of seeing one are almost always bores. I set them on their road about ten oâ€™clock, & could not resist a dark stroll in the garden. The temptation whispers from the window all the timeâ€”so pleasant to step out onto the lawn, walk across to the tool house, & survey the downs in day time or the lights of Lewes by night. Much remains to be done inside the house, though the main arrangements are now made. But for some days oneâ€™s mind is distracted by perpetually dwelling upon the changes round one; it works with an effort. This is wearing off slightly, though I write this as if I were raising 7 stone on my pen instead of the usual number of ounces. However from all the difficulties, advantages & disadvantages of the place, I think the upshot is wholly favourable. One gains much in the way of variety here; there are more walks, & endless interests in the garden, though nothing of the flawless beauty of Asheham.
