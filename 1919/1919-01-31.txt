### Friday 31 January

Here I solace my restlessness as usual upon returning from the Club upon this book. I visited the Omega, & heard Roger wheedling a fat German lady to buy stuff, & doing his best to be polite to Mr Powell, an art gentleman who makes glass in South Kensington I suppose, & can believe. Thence through streets of frozen mud, snow, slush, slippery & congealed into little knobs like those on an astrachan coat, to the Club (& here I am interrupted by the voice of my dear old friend, Desmond, upon the telephoneâ€”10 minutes discourse. Yes, heâ€™s taking a house at Oare, perhaps, & wishes us to be near him, & will come on Tuesday to bring a story, & is lodging at Littlehampton, & will subscribe to the Review, & send a flimsy for 10/â€”no, 12/-of course, & theyâ€™ve let Wellington Square, & propose to live cheap & spend half the year in the country, which he doesnâ€™t much like, but there it is. Here, with sympathetic enquiries about my health & tooth, we ring off.) Yes, its sympathy that Desmond has; & thus Iâ€™m switched back again to old Lytton. But old Lytton I must at once acquit of wishing to impress me with his Calves & his Heinemanns; I think he mentioned a concert, & this is it. Let me try to account for the fact that he has â€˜dominatedâ€™ (why, even the word is his) a generation at Cambridge, & make it square with my disparaging remarks. How did he do it, how is he so distinct & unmistakable if he lacks orginality & the rest? Is there any reputable escape from this impasse in saying that he is a great deal better than his books? or am I too chary of praise for those books? Am I jealous? Do I compare the 6 editions of Eminent Victorians with the one of The Voyage Out? Perhaps thereâ€™s a hint of jealousy; but, if I underrate, I think the main cause is that while I admire, enjoy up to a point & up to a point agree, Iâ€™m not interested in what he writes. Thomas Hardy has what I call an interesting mind; so have Conrad & Hudson; but not Lytton nor Matthew Arnold nor John Addington Symonds.

Life is getting crowded out altogether. But life hasnâ€™t been very enjoyable these last few days. Conceive a conspiracy of fog, frost, strike on Tube railways, & on top of that servant hunting for Nessa. This last has ended disastrously. I braved Mrs Abbey once more yesterday, snatched my Phoebe Crane from the jaws of mistresses innumerable, only to hear now that sheâ€™s not wanted, & must be put off with a pound note to solace her. This is the imposing pinnacle to my fortnights castle building with Budge & the rest; the cards fall down & things are as they were. Letters upon letters have been written in that bold hand & business like style unnatural to me, telegrams sent, Nelly entreated, brains ransacked, & journeys of penitence made with the result that 32/- is now scattered among undeserving people. But I must record a little sunshine today, less cold; &, to balance that, the district railway on strike.

Desmond has not rung up. That is quite a good preface to the description of his character. The difficulty which faces one in writing of Desmond is that one is almost forced to describe an Irishman: how he misses trains, seems born without a rudder to drift wherever the current is strongest; how he keeps hoping & planning, & shuffles along, paying his way by talking so enchantingly that editors forgive, & shopmen give him credit & at least one distinguished peer leaves him a thousand in his will.
