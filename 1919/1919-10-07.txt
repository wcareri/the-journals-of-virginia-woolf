### Tuesday 7 October

Home yesterday. The â€˜docile herdsâ€™ whom I describe on Peace day are not so deluded after all. They have held the country up for eleven days, I think. We did a little to support them too, & kept one man on strike who would have gone back without our pound. Still, whatâ€™s to be read in the papers is hardly fit for my private page. I wonder if I could expound the railway strike? What they asked, & what they got? At any rate the strike broke in to our life more than the war didâ€”but Iâ€™ve written my diary, intermittently, & have it at Rodmell. Thereâ€™s a private strike to record too. I should like to write philosophically & analyse what is no doubt a signâ€”dont they call it?â€”of the times. We must think out our position. The question is, are we to fling off in a new direction? What do we want? Now at our age, where youth is not quite over, & discretion is fully blown, but not long seatedâ€”its not so easy to know what one does want, I meant to add, but that reflectionâ€™s two days old. Dear old Nelly came in shyly like a school girl & asked to apologise last night; & I see us settled for life, with Hogarth, Monkâ€™s House, & two domestics.

I have no time to fill this page, since I must read my review book, (Landor), read Loganâ€™s stories, write a letter or two, & Iâ€™ve let the time since tea slip. I began reading the first volume of my diary; & see that its second anniversary is now reached. I dont think the first volume makes such good reading as the last; a proof that all writing, even this unpremeditated scribbling, has its form, which one learns. Is it worth going on with? The trouble is, that if one goes on a year or so more, one will feel bound on that account to continue. I wonder why I do it. Partly, I think, from my old sense of the race of time â€˜Timeâ€™s winged chariot hurrying nearâ€™â€”Does it stay it?
