### Wednesday 18 June

I went off, as I now remember, to call on Adrian, as I was early for Ray; & found that strange couple just decided to become medical students. After 5 yearsâ€™ training they will, being aged 35 & 41 or so, set up together in practise as psycho-analysts. This is the surface bait that has drawn them. The more profound cause is, I suppose, the old question which used to weigh so heavy on Adrian, what to do? Here is another chance; visions of success & a busy, crowded, interesting life beguile him. Halfway through, I suppose, something will make it all impossible; & then, having forgotten his law, he will take up whatâ€”farming or editing a newspaper, or keeping bees perhaps. I donâ€™t see that it matters at all, so long as they always have some carrot dangling in front of them. Dinner with Ray; talk with Dorothy Bussy of her past; promise of her play, & so home with L. who had dined higher up with Margaret. That morning (Friday 13th to be exact) I got the first proofs of my novel. Iâ€™ve now had 64 pages. On Sunday we planned to go to Kew & have tea there, but Logan rang us up, & we came home to see him. More stories, a little less carefully told & so more to my liking; & then we came indoors, & he read us his stories from the bible. At this moment we have the following manuscripts or promises of manuscripts. Paris by Hope Mirrlees. Novel by Altounyan. Stories by Logan. Play by D. Bussy. Rayâ€™s grandmotherâ€™s sexual-religious experiences. And old Bob caught Leonard last night at the Apostlesâ€™ dinner & pressed upon him a translation of Lucretius. What steps weâ€™re to take is not at the moment clear to me. Whether to become a shop, or remain a small private pressâ€”whether to get help or refuse it. Logan, of course, has a charming young man up his sleeve. How futile these elderly people are! Thereâ€™s Maurice Baring gone & printed one copy of an anthology at a cost of Â£40 to give Lady Diana Manners for a presentâ€”& she is one of those vaguely literary people who â€œsometimes read Shakespeareâ€. Logan approves of this on the whole. He likes to supervise these literary undertakings, & would even give money, but doesnâ€™t want to be disturbed out of his habits. He is printing several anthologies himself in the autumn, â€œI consider that Iâ€™ve done my bitâ€ he said, with a comfortable sigh, after saying that he had been correcting the proofs of these works. He now goes yatchting for a holiday.

Yesterday, Tuesday, I was treated to ices at Gunterâ€™s by Clive. It was all the same as before. Little tables; long rather dark shop; numbers of gilt chairs; discreet buffet; elderly waitresses in black; & couples scattered all about silently, or almost silently, absorbing ices & sugared cakes. There was an aristocratic small boy got up like a picture of Queen Victoria as a child, with a great sash, & a bow, & a hat wreathed in roses. His mother had brought him in, we thought, from one of the great Berkeley Square houses. Then there was youth, by some misadventure not at Ascot; a coffee-coloured young man, & a semi-transparent girl. We strolled out of this solemn cave & sauntered through the purest 18th Century London to the Green Park where we sat on hard green chairs, & watched people passing down the little slope towards the Palace. This being, I suppose, the 6th week without rain the grass is already haycoloured & slippery. We gossiped, speculated, & reminisced. Very easy, agreeable talk to my mind, & then what an age Iâ€™ve knowâ [n] him! How much weâ€™ve been through side by sideâ€”these infrequent meetings are little islands upon which one stands surveying the flood racing away in the past; looking out over the future, safely & with very little anxiety just at present. He talks of going to Paris in the autumn, to see whatâ€™s on; & heâ€™s given up his book, & finds that articles of 2,000 words exactly suit him. He thinks of subjects in his bath. He makes money. He spends it on ices & dinners at the CafÃ© Royal. He dines out every night, enjoys every moment, & feels his senses quicker & stronger as time goes on. We agreed in finding life very delightful, though very different for each of us. Home, to await Miss Barbara Lynch, but she never came. The meeting talked to its hearts content. Mrs Whitty & another pressed me for copies of Kew Gardens. But I donâ€™t want them to read the scene of the two women. Is that to the discredit of Kew Gardens? Perhaps a little. Iâ€™ve just been there, in the flesh, & sat under a tree, reading The Way of all Flesh, which I have to review tomorrow. According to Fredegond thereâ€™s been a crisis between Alix & James. She tried to break with him; failed; went reeling off to Tidmarsh in what state of mind I donâ€™t quite know, & there is at the moment. James inhabits Gordon Sqreâ€”
