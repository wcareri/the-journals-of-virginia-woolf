Captain Tregerthen Short has now got my letter, & written me an answer, & even drawn me a sketch, & appears not only willing but anxious to let us have his three cottages, at a rent of a year each. I have replied, also in the course of these last few days, that we will probably take them, & truth to tell, I have spent the greater part of the time on the slope beneath our house, which Leonard has already planted with fuchsias, or crouched on a rock, watching the great foam swirl of the waves. In a pessimistic walk by the river yesterday L. made this capacity for being happy first at Asheham, then at Tregerthen, the text of a discourse upon the illusory nature of all pleasures & pains; from which he concludes that mankind is a wretched tribe of animals, & even the works of Shakespeare no good save as his skill in doing it excites oneâ€™s pleasure. Shall I own that I attribute some of this to my wretched family, who asked me up to dine with them, & I went? & also to Night & Day which L. has spent the past 2 mornings & evenings in reading? I own that his verdict, finally pronounced this morning gives me immense pleasure: how far one should discount it, I donâ€™t know. In my own opinion N. & D. is a much more mature & finished & satisfactory book than The Voyage Out; as it has reason to be. I suppose I lay myself open to the charge of niggling with emotions that donâ€™t really matter. I certainly donâ€™t anticipate even two editions. And yet I canâ€™t help thinking that, English fiction being what it is, I compare for originality & sincerity rather well with most of the moderns. L. finds the philosophy very melancholy. It too much agrees with what he was saying yesterday. Yet, if one is to deal with people on a large scale & say what one thinks, how can one avoid melancholy? I donâ€™t admit to being hopeless thoughâ€”only the spectacle is a profoundly strange one; & as the current answers donâ€™t do, one has to grope for a new one; & the process of discarding the old, when one is by no means certain what to put in their place, is a sad one. Still, if you think of it, what answers do Arnold Bennett or Thackeray, for instance, suggest? Happy onesâ€”satisfactory solutionsâ€”answers one would accept, if one had the least respect for oneâ€™s soul? Now I have done my last odious piece of typewriting, & when I have scribbled this page, I shall write & suggest Monday as the day for coming up to lunch with Gerald. I donâ€™t suppose Iâ€™ve ever enjoyed any writing so much as I did the last half of N. & D. Indeed, no part of it taxed me as The Voyage Out did; & if oneâ€™s own ease & interest promise anything good, I should have hopes that some people, at least, will find it a pleasure. I wonder if I shall ever be able to read it again? Is the time coming when I can endure to read my own writing in print without blushing & shivering & wishing to take cover?

Our dinner last night at the Isola Bella was rather a brilliant affair in the Bohemian style, with a great deal of wine, & talk of books & pictures, & a general air of freedom & contentâ€”though I fancy that Rogerâ€”I was specially warned by Nessa not to let him know that she & Duncan were in the bath, which casts some light on his point of view. At the end of dinner the Padrone, as we called him, (Clive chattered Italian with the greatest gusto) brought a large sketch book, in which Nessa & Duncan & Roger all drew pictures, & we were rewarded by a bottle of Marsala. Then home; leaving Nessa & Roger in Fitzroy Street, with Clive, Mary & Duncan following behind. We talked by the way a great amount of Athenaeum gossip, all secretly delighted with our own importance; Clive & Roger to do art criticism, the most brilliant list of contributors on record; & indeed I open this book again solely to record the fact that Murry has applied to me for a signed article, which I shall send him.
