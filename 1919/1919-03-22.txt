### Saturday 22 March

Today among other things the coal strike is postponed, & the Guards march through London. L. might have seen them, but thought it not worth the loss of his seat in the Tube. As to private news, our new bookcase came & one part has been set up in the drawing room: the other is too large to get upstairs to my room. Further we have decided to take 2 cottages at Tregerthen if we can get them; & this brings me to Katherine Murry from whom I heard of them. The inscrutable woman remains inscrutable Iâ€™m glad to say; no apologies, or sense of apologies due. At once she flung down her pen & plunged, as if weâ€™d been parted for 10 minutes, into the question of Dorothy Richardson; & so on with the greatest freedom & animation on both sides until I had to catch my train. Perhaps its I who live in the suburbs & think it necessary to answer letters; that would be a proper retort to my jest of the underworld. But somethingâ€”something dark & catastrophic possibly to do with Murryâ€”has taken place since we met. So much she hinted; but said she wished now to forget itâ€”something that had absorbed her, apparently. But this was a momentary revelation as I left. Otherwise, as I say, we chattered about the Athenaeum mostly, & I was much complimented to hear how much they wish for my writing, in proof of which I have a book this morning from Murry. And again, as usual, I find with Katherine what I donâ€™t find with the other clever women a sense of ease & interest, which is, I suppose, due to her caring so genuinely if so differently from the way I care, about our precious art. Though Katherine is now in the very heart of the professional worldâ€”4 books on her table to reviewâ€”she is, & will always be I fancy, not the least of a hack. I donâ€™t feel as I feel with Molly Hamilton that is say, ashamed of the inkpot. Before this I met Hope Mirrlees at the Clubâ€”a very self conscious, wilful, prickly & perverse young woman, rather conspicuously well dressed & pretty, with a view of her own about books & style, an aristocratic & conservative tendency in opinion, & a corresponding taste for the beautiful & elaborate in literature. For example, she had been examining Swift as to his use of words; whether he used them properly, & found him deficient compared with Burke, who writes from this point of view magnificently though detestably from any other. She uses a great number of French words, which she pronounces exquisitely; she seems capricious in her friendships, & no more to be marshalled with the long goose wand which I can sometimes apply to people than a flock of bright green parrokeets.

â€˜Will you write to me, Hope?â€ I asked.  
â€œO no. I canâ€™t write to people.â€  
So we parted in the Charing Cross Road for the next six months, I suppose.

But to tell the truth what Iâ€™m thinking about most is neither Katherine nor Hope, but the two cottages at Higher Tregerthen. About now, I suppose, Captain Short of St Ives is opening my letter.
