### Monday 23 June

If I hadnâ€™t had since midday to settle myself, I should still be twanging & twittering with Garsington. But parties donâ€™t fluster me as they used. I dont much care now about the great question of hair, & doing up dresses; I am resigned to my station among the badly dressed, though GravÃ© & her vagaries, & the speeding up of my blue dress, & doubts as to its beauty scarcely seem to confirm that statement. Here, I think, the great & at present sore, question of aesthetic taste enters in. Why am I calm & indifferent as to what people say of Night & Day, & fretful for their good opinion of my blue dress?

However this may be, I enjoyed Garsington saying to myself â€œThe worst moment will be when I come into the drawing room in my blue dress before dinner.â€ I planned thus to get dressed quick & come in before Ott. which is not difficult as Ott. never gets dressed quick. Mercifully I need not face Garsington squarely & draw its picture. I observed that the sealing wax red drawing room is a good deal smaller this visit than last, & last visit than first. Thatâ€™s what happens to people too. There was young Lord de la Warr walking among the roses & cabbages, a boy of 19, who after sweeping mines as a seaman is now a socialist, under the guidance of Lansbury. But I took a good look at him & noticed the straightness of his body, ease, & certainty of his manner which mark him out from Gertler quite emphatically. Gertler & Nelson strolled up another garden path. Nelson one of the insignificant, I should say, who has attached himself firmly to the comforts of Garsington. His anxiety to accept an invitation to dinner proved his relish for that one of Ottolineâ€™s bounties. The population was floating & changing. Goldie & I were permanent; Aldous H. came for one night. I shall leave out several names if I try to count them. Young Lord de la Warr said very little; but I think he would have impressed an American, & good manners conciliate me. I think Goldie was the principle element in the week end, that is to say that he took upon him the brunt of Sunday morning, & meal times; 3 hours sitting on a hard seat with Ott. & me, Philip sometimes, Gertler occasionally, & Aldous off & on was a trial; but for us all it was well surmounted. I did not guess the time once. When Philip suggested a visit to the pigs I was ready but not over-ready. I think we discussed Roger most carefully & Forster, & Bob. Ott. needled away at her embroidery, Philipâ€™s bedspread, losing her needle once, & crouching on all fours behind the seat, while Goldie & I went on talking. This seemed to me to typify her modest position; so long as people talk she doesnâ€™t much want to interfere, & she listens, especially if peopleâ€™s characters are discussed. She had worked off the great Picasso grievance upon Goldie; I had only vague lamentations, & aspirations for my share. Yet it struck me as strange
