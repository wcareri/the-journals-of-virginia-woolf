### Thursday 6 November

Sydney & Morgan dined with us last night. On the whole, Iâ€™m glad I sacrificed a concert. The doubt about Morgan & N. & D. is removed; I understand why he likes it less than V.O. &, in understanding, see that it is not a criticism to discourage. Perhaps intelligent criticism never is. All the same, I shirk writing it out, because I write so much criticism. What he said amounted to this: N. & D. is a strictly formal & classical work; that being so one requires, or he requires, a far greater degree of lovabilility in the characters than in a book like V.O. which is vague & universal. None of the characters in N. & D. is lovable. He did not care how they sorted themselves out. Neither did he care for the characters in V.O. but there he felt no need to care for them. Otherwise, he admired practically everything; his blame does not consist in saying that N. & D. is less remarkable than tâ€™other. O & beauties it has in plentyâ€”in fact, I see no reason to be depressed on his account. Sidney said he had been completely upset by it; & was of opinion that I had on this occasion â€˜brought it offâ€™. But what a bore Iâ€™m becoming! Yes, even old Virginia will skip a good deal of this; but at the moment it seems important. The Cambridge Magazine repeats what Morgan said about dislike of the characters; yet I am in the forefront of contemporary literature. Iâ€™m cynical about my figures, they say: but directly they go into detail, Morgan who read the Review sitting over the gas fire, began to disagree. So all critics split off, & the wretched author who tries to keep control of them is torn asunder.

For the first time this many years I walked along the river bank between ten & eleven. Yes, its like the shut up house I once compared it to: the room with its dust sheets on the chairs. The fishermen are not out so early; an empty path; but a large aeroplane on business. We talked very easily, the proof being that we (I anyhow) did not mind silences. Morgan has the artists mind; he says the simple things that clever people donâ€™t say; I find him the best of critics for that reason. Suddenly out comes the obvious thing that one has overlooked. He is in trouble with a novel of his own, fingering the keys but only producing discords so far. He is anxious to begin again & moderate reviewing. We timed our walk admirably for him to catch his train, We have promised to go to the Hutchinsons tonight; but as L. is at the Famine Conference, & thereâ€™s something disagreeable to me about that circle which makes me reluctant to go alone, I donâ€™t suppose we shall.
