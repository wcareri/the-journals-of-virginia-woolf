### Thursday 22 May

A few vegetable notes ought to prelude this page: the weather continues fine; the blue seems eternal; an occasional wind rises; we rock slightly; then steady ourselves, & ride on serenely. The apple blossom, which deluged Ottoline & looked so soft beside her cheeks, is over; 2 red rambler roses are pricking through. We dine of course out of doors to the sound of the fountain. The robins douche themselves there. Last night there were six voices to drown its perpetual drippingâ€”Altounyan, A. & K. & Bob dining with us. I had a vision of Bob as a tory squire; at any rate a conservative, mahogany coloured gentleman, innocent of rhyme. How far this is from the truth may be gauged from the fact that he swells with four separate volumes, & is to be delivered in the autumn. The good shrewd sound Trevelyan stock shows through; moreover he is well cropped & brown for a poet. He is also a comic character, & rises higher in that sphere when he feels himself inspired by laughter. His ungainly compliments to Karin, his eager awkward ways, made us all shout with laughter. Altounyan is an effervescent Armenian, shy, but ready to bubble on provocation either of a literary or political nature. But Bob talked us all down. I must omit an exquisitely flattering duet between me & A. when I had a surfeit of praise for Kew Gardensâ€”the best prose of the 20th century, surpassing Mark on the Wall, possessing transcendent virtues, save for one passage, between the women, & highly admired by Clive & Roger. I was at pains to sweeten his enthusiasm with this relish, since his native product is not of the very highest quality perhaps. Yes, authors are rather a despicable race I think. Iâ€™d composed myself to face failure so stoically that this unexpected gift was, at the moment, delicious. Forster approves too. But Altounyan has weighted his praises with a thick wad of mss., written, not typed, which we are to read & consider, & upon our verdict depends the whole of his future. Further, he appointed us his literary executors; everything he writes in Armenia is to be sent to usâ€”to do what we like with. He gave us Â£2 towards our future. Still, to read a novel in manuscript, & settle a young manâ€™s future, & his wifeâ€™s, & his childrensâ€”that is a severe price for 10 minutes of praise. Aâ drian. seemed to me to deserve Hendersonâ€™s saying â€œHe knows the right sneer for every occasionâ€. He strikes me as more & more of a moon to the lusty red sun provided by Karin; & the light he throws upon whatever turns up is more & more bleaching and cadaverous. The truth is he has no occupation.
