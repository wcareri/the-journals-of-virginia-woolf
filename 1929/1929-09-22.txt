### Sunday 22 September

And it is ten minutes past ten in the morning, & I am not going to write a word. I have resolved to shut down my fiction for the present. My head aches too easily at the moment; I feel The Moths a prodigious weight which I canâ€™t lift yet. And yet, so odd a thing is the mind, I am never easy, at this early hour, merely reading or writing letters. Those occupations seem too light & diffused. Hence, though write letters I will & mustâ€”to Dotty, to Gerald Brenan, to peevish Eddy, I will canter here a moment. It is a fine September morning; the rooks cawing, the shadows very long & shallow on the terrace. The body has gone out of the air. It is thinning itself for winter. It is becoming pale & pure like the eyes of an old man. An exacting & rather exhausting summer this has been. What with going to London, going to Worthing & having people here, I have never settled in; I feel I should like to stay on & avoid London for a time. The car makes us almost too movable. On the other hand, this is the best appointed summer we have ever had. Never has the garden been so lovelyâ€”all ablaze even now; dazzling oneâ€™s eyes with reds & pinks & purples & mauves: the carnations in great bunches, the roses lit like lamps. Often we go out after dinner to see these sights. And at last I like looking about the drawing room. I like my rug; my carpet; my painted beams. And for some odd reason I have found lovelier walks this year than everâ€”up into the downs behind Telscombe. Partly it is the weather, perhaps; we have had day after day of cloudless warm sun; the sky has been blue day after day; the sun has gone down clean, clear, leaving no feathers or battlements in the west. And lying out here I have seen the sun rise, & the moon shining one night like a slice of looking glass, with all the stars rippling & shining; & one night I had that curious feeling of being very young, travelling abroad, & seeing the leaves from a train window, in Italyâ€”I cant get the feeling right now. All was adventure & excitement.

As for Peter, how right how charming how good he is!â€”but damn it all, what an uninteresting mind, intellectually. I cant put my finger on it, but nothing remains in oneâ€™s mind after seeing him, nothing interesting, no suggestion. Incessant similes, perpetual quotation; he sees life with great ardour through books. And then he is now all agog to copulate, which makes his stories centre round that fascinating subject too inevitablyâ€”copulation & Kingâ€™s College Cambridge. He went through the war, & has had 4 years of battle & blood & wounds, & yet his mind keeps the virginal simplicity of a girls; he has the rigidity, at 36, of a crusted college character. I suppose the mixture is not very rich in himâ€”thats all: father a schoolmaster, mother a housekeeper, life in the suburbs, scholarships &c: that was his upbringing; & then coming out of his shell, he deliberately vowed to be pagan, to be individual, to enjoy life, to explore his own sensations when there wasnâ€™t much matter to go on. Hence the repetition, the egotism, the absence of depth or character; but I feel all this far more when he writes than in talk. In talk his charm & niceness, his integrity, his brightness, all make him a very nice, dear, delightful, memorable (yes, but not interesting) human being. He will marry; he will become Prof. of Engl. Lit. at Camb.
