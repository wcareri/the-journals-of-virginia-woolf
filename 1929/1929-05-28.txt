### Tuesday 28 May

It is an odd summer, this one, unexampled perhaps in our history. We are going off to Cassis on Tuesday for a week. This is a revolution. We have never been abroad so late in the year I think. The Election will be over. We shall be governed by a Tory or a Labour partyâ€”Tory, I suppose. For the benefit of posterity I may say that nobody pretends to know, with the exception of the candidates. They are allâ€”even Hubertâ€”confident. And I feel, rather oddly, that this is an important election. Walking down the Kingâ€™s Road with Sidney Waterlow the other nightâ€”having been to dine at his club off a mahogany table surrounded by the portraits of statesmenâ€”I had a cocktail, but no wineâ€”& it was a thundery dayâ€”Leonard had a headacheâ€”& we sat in the ladies reception roomâ€”a ducks egg coloured room with globes of light sending their light up, not downâ€”very cool, smooth solid, something like sitting inside a shape of blanc mangeâ€”then said Sidney, feeling that something must be done, shall we go & see the Sangers? It was a thing that one ought to do. It would give them such pleasure. And he bought me 3 bunches of violets at the door from a woman who said it was her 40th wedding day: a tribute to my having once been asked in marriage by Sidney was it?â€”I held them in my hand all the evening, & we found the Sangers out; only a menial man came up from the basement. So we said we will call on the MacCarthys. And so it was that we walked along the Kingâ€™s Road, talking about the Election. Sidney said that human nature has improved. We are all becoming gentler & wiser. Even the dogs are. One never sees a dog fight now he said, & sure enough the big mongrel trotted across the road very peacefully to sniff at the door of a public house. There the story stops. For I dont think much happened at the MacCarthys. One had to talk. I noticed nothing, I think. The memorable things happen when there is a great space of silence all round them perhaps. I dont know.

Now about this book, The Moths. How am I to begin it? And what is it to be? I feel no great impulse; no fever; only a great pressure of difficulty. Why write it then? Why write at all? Every morning I write a little sketch, to amuse myself.

I am not saying, I might say, that these sketches have any relevance. I am not trying to tell a story. Yet perhaps it might be done in that way. A mind thinking. They might be islands of lightâ€”islands in the stream that I am trying to convey: life itself going on. The current of the moths flying strongly this way. A lamp & a flower pot in the centre. The flower can always be changing. But there must be more unity between each scene than I can find at present. Autobiography it might be called. How am I to make one lap, or act, between the coming of the moths, more intense than another; if there are only scenes? One must get the sense that this is the beginning: this the middle; that the climaxâ€”when she opens the window & the moth comes in. I shall have the two different currentsâ€”the moths flying along; the flower upright in the centre; a perpetual crumbling & renewing of the plant. In its leaves she might see things happen. But who is she? I am very anxious that she should have no name. I dont want a Lavinia or a Penelope: I want â€˜Sheâ€™. But that becomes arty, Liberty, greenery yallery somehow: symbolic in loose robes. Of course I can make her think backwards & forwards; I can tell stories. But thats not it. Also I shall do away with exact place & time. Anything may be out of the windowâ€”a shipâ€”a desertâ€”London.
