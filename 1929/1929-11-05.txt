### Tuesday 5 November

Oh but I have done quite well so far with R. of oneâ€™s Own: & it sells, I think; & I get unexpected letters. But I am more concerned with my Waves. Iâ€™ve just typed out my mornings work; & canâ€™t feel altogether sure. There is something there (as I felt about Mrs Dalloway) but I canâ€™t get at it, squarely; nothing like the speed & certainty of The Lighthouse: Orlando mere childs play. Is there some falsity, of method, somewhere? Something tricky?â€”so that the interesting things arenâ€™t firmly based? I am in an odd state; feel a cleavage; hereâ€™s my interesting thing; & thereâ€™s no quite solid table on which to put it. It might come in a flash, on re-readingâ€”some solvent. I am convinced that I am right to seek for a station whence I can set my people against time & the seaâ€”but Lord, the difficulty of digging oneself in there, with conviction. Yesterday I had conviction; it has gone today. Yet I have written 66 pages in the past month.

Yesterday Sibyl came; & I told her that she was like a bird holding a stinking mouse in its clawsâ€”& the mouse was life. She admitted it. She said she had to go through an unpleasant business; was going to Paris this morning; would tell me of it afterwards. Then she bemoaned her lot, guardedly; how she had grown up so late, & only now began to see what it was she wanted. I gather that it is intimacy, simplicity, & friendship that she wants; & it is a little late in life to demand them; & how can she get them now, needing Â£20,000 a year too? So Arthur cant retire; they must sit there & see the season through; she cant, at the moment, master life; it is not a dead mouse after all; but wriggles. She looked ringeyed, puckeredâ€”I saw her in a flash, quite old. Her eyes were very tragic.

And today Stephen Tennant comes to tea. & Arthur Waley. On Sunday we were at Rodmell; & my room is now about three feet of brick, with the window frames in; rather an eyesore, for it cuts off the garage roof & the downsâ€”both pleasanter sights than I had thought. They have driven a small hole through the little room, for the passage; so that by this time, no doubt, that is in being. & things fall & rise & disappear & re-appear. And most of my joy was turned to rage because I let Southease sale of furniture slip, & could have furnished my room perfectly for Â£20 I daresay. Such is oneâ€™s lifeâ€”yes, such: (a convenient phrase;) And I am asked daily to lecture; & L.â€™s freedom draws near. Wright will inherit, & is making his dispositions. I keep saying â€œWe shall be able to do that when you have left the Nationâ€. Still, you see what with oil stoves & Annie, battling my way to freedom. Jan. 1st is the day. We have had the Nation for nearly seven years, without making it blood & bone of ours, as once I thought possible. A tepid paper; neither this nor that, with the perpetual drag of Hubert & Harold, Hubert kindly incompetent, Harold competent but to me, all wood, red apple, sawdust, plausibility, respectability, hesitation & compromise.
