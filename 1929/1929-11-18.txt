### Monday 18 November

Well it is over, & much better than I expectedâ€”at least for the present. To my question Do you want to give me notice? she replied â€œI have given you noticeâ€”..â€ Further argument was attempted & cut short by me. â€œThen you wish to go at the end of your monthâ€”12th December.â€ â€œAs we refused her an hours extra help when she was ill, yes.â€ But this was said without conviction. I clinched it by looking at the calendar (which I could not see, blind as I am) & then left her, in the calmest flattest way possibleâ€”which means Iâ€™m afraid that she has no more intention of going on Dec. 12th than I have of taking ship to Siberia. So be it. My mind is like a gum when an aching tooth has been drawn. I am having a holidayâ€”reading old Birrell, & shall hope that the dust will be settled now for a week or two. The Horsham tiles are being put on my roof, so Percy writes this morning; which means that my rooms must be almost done. And now I have an extra room thereâ€”Nellyâ€™sâ€”yes; & no servant in the house hereâ€”thank Godâ€”two friends to come in one early tâ€™other late; no more Bloomsbury gossipâ€”no more Lottie barging in & out; no more fear of having people to lunch & tea & dinner; no more pains in the back, swollen ankles, & ups & downs of passion & effusion. And so, what with the oil stove, Annie, giving up the Nation, new rooms new servants, the new year will be one of the most interestingâ€”a great advance towards freedom which is the ideal state of the soul. Yet it must not be thought that I have suffered acutely from servitude. My one claim on my own gratitude is that, directly I feel a chain, I throw it off: think of leaving Fitzroy; leaving Hogarthâ€”leaving Hyde Park Gate I was going to say to round the sentence & indeed I think I have been an old struggler after my fashionâ€”not so valiant I daresay as Nessa, but tenacious too & bold.
