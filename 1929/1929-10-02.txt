### Wednesday 2 October

We have just been over Annieâ€™s cottageâ€”so I suppose it is. & we therefore own another fair sized house; but the arrangement with Annie seems another of those plums which since this time, or August, last year, have dropped into our hands here. She will cook; my oil stove makes hot meals practicable at all hours; but I am dazed with the Brighton conference; hearing Henderson orate & seeing him get red slowly like a lobster; we went on Monday too (how my days of reflection have dwindled! one must give it all up now) & heard a good, interesting, debate. The audience makes an extraordinary baaing noise; not talk, not footstepsâ€”& I thought how politics was no longer an affair of great nobles & mystery & diplomacy, but of commonsense, issuing from ordinary men & women of businessâ€”not very exalted, but straight forward, like any other business affair.

The light is dying; I hear the village boys kicking footballs; & all those reflections, comments, that occur to me walking are died outâ€”the atmosphere, winter, change, Londonâ€™s imminence, scatter, finally, my poor efforts at solid concentration. Yet I have, these last days, set my book alight I thinkâ€”got it going; but at a rate like that of Jacobâ€™s Room Mrs Dalloway daysâ€”a page at most, & long sitting sucking my pen. And all the Americans write & cable for articles. And I shall go in & read Phedre, having picked some apples. Leonard in the cold windy road is cleaning the car.
