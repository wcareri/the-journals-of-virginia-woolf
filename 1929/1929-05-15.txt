### Wednesday 15 May

This is written, as many pages in the past used to be written, to try a new pen; for I am vacillatingâ€”cant be sure to stick to the old pen any more. And then every gold pen has some fatal drawback. Never have I met one without. And then one cant be sure till oneâ€™s written a long screed. And then oneâ€™s ashamed to go backâ€”& then one doesâ€”& then it all begins again, like Mathew Arnoldâ€™s river, or sea (brings in again &c &c).

I went to Sibylâ€™s dinner; but Heavens, how little real point there is to these meetingsâ€”save indeed that the food is good; & there is wine, & a certain atmosphere of luxury & hospitality. This, on the other hand, tends to drug one; one has been given something, for which one has to pay. And I donâ€™t like that feeling. The old white haired baby George Moore sat propped up in his high chair; his hair now white like flax, like silk; his cheeks tinted a childs pink; his eyes with their marble hardness; his boneless ineffective hands. For some reason, he paid me compliments, indeed referred to me as an authority on English; & even offered, which I daresay was kindly meant, though nothing has happened, to send me one of his books.

What did we discuss? Mostly himself & his books, I think; & how he had known various old dim figures, far away in the past. I told them about Lord Alfredâ€™s threat, & this launched him on stories about Robbie Ross, & his own lawsuits. But he is a detached shrewd old man; without many illusions & not very dependent on anyone, I should say. He wanted to walk back to Ebury Street, but it was raining & they made him take a cab. He talked about Henry James, & a proof sheet which nobody could read; & he said that a sentence ought to form like a cloud at the end of the penâ€”dont you think so? he said to me. These little compliments were due to my Geraldine & Jane which he said was an admirable story & should be published as such. It had nothing to do with fact. And I rather think he will die soonâ€”he has to have another operation; but in his detached way. I think these artists are slightly bored by all physical transactions. Let my body die, I can imagine him saying, so long as I can go on forming sentences at the end of my penâ€”& why not? Save that of course he says he enjoys the pleasures of the body. But that I rather doubt.

And I doubt too if Clive does. Clive is I fancy in bad odour everywhere at the moment, with his silly egotistic waysâ€”writing to me to boast of a â€˜mysteryâ€™, which it is clear that I am to impart; but I shant. He is like Lottie au fond; & Lottie by the way is dismissed; & is said to owe Karin Â£8 which she canâ€™t pay, & great scenes take place, poor Adrian, as I imagine, moping & glooming in discomfort alone; with Karin savage & violent & competent spasmodically, rushing out to pay bills & put her house in order in ten minutes when she has neglected it all these years: sordid & squalid it all is, & hardly gives me any pleasure, to tell the truth, these sufferings of my friends.

I am depressed. Brace has done it. The oval faced sallow man. They want to keep W. & F., which I like, till the spring, & make P. of F. come out this autumnâ€”a book I hate; & was, as I think, wrongly pressed to undertake. And then Roger wants to come to Rodmell, & I donâ€™t like after my protests, to say no; & yet to have to talk & talkâ€”& then Philcox canâ€™t get my rooms done, all because of Durrantâ€™s long waiting. So my wheel is turning low. & do I like this pen or dont I? Such are my sorrows Mr Wesley, as the man said when the servant put on too many coals.

What Clive says is that he has a mystery; something he cant share; & this annoys me too; the sensation mongering, like Dotty; the desire to be talked of. Oh, I say, if only I could plunge my mind into the delights of pure imagination, & so get some pull on this horrid world of real life!

But I must some how wind up this account of flies in the eye & go up to dinner & try to think of some cause of pleasure with Leonard. Something cheerful. Oh but then I must grind on at Proust, I suppose; & then copy out passages. Never mind, I will try my new pen & see if that doesnâ€™t cheer me. Because clearly these miseries are very small trivial miseries, & fundamentally I am the happiest woman in all W.C.1. The happiest wife, the happiest writer, the most liked inhabitant, so I say, in Tavistock Square. When I count up my blessings, they must surely amount to more than my sorrows; even when I have all these flies in my eyes.

Well, what am I going to have for dinner? And I will hastily try my new pen on this last page, making it rapidly describe my complete renovation of domestic lifeâ€”odd, I didnâ€™t do it before: that I order dinner no longer; but write it in a book & thus put glass between me & Nelly.

Oh & George Duckworth rang up this morning. A French couple who admire me: could I lunch: & my teeth he says, drop out, while I talk, while I eat; & they preferred Brighton to Penshurst.
