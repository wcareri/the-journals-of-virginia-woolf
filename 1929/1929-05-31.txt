### Friday 31 May

The oculist said to me this afternoon â€œPerhaps youâ€™re not as young as you wereâ€. This is the first time that has been said to me; & it seemed to me an astonishing statement. It means that one now seems to a stranger not a woman, but an elderly woman. Yet even so, though I felt wrinkled & aged for an hour, & put on a manner of great wisdom & toleration, buying a coat, even so, I forget it soon; & am â€˜a womanâ€™ again. Another light on my character or appearanceâ€”Coming up Southampton Row, a man snapped me & then said stop; & made me pay 6d for a silly little damp film, which I did not want; nor did I want to stay talking politics to a ferrety little rascal, having had little lunch. But my face marked me for his victim.

â€œWe are winningâ€ Nelly said at tea. I was shocked to think that we both desire the Labour party to winâ€”why? partly that I dont want to be ruled by Nelly. I think to be ruled by Nelly & Lottie would be a disaster. It is dribbled out. Last night at Charleston we heard election results spoken very distinctly in the drawing room. Driving home through Lewes there was not a single light downstairs. No one was even listening in. The streets were perfectly empty. One man was pumpshipping against the station wall. I had imagined a crowd, flares, shouts, white sheetsâ€”only three black cats, out on business with the mice. So we shall be ruled by labour.

We went down to Worthing to see Leonardâ€™s mother, laid like an old roseâ€”rather lovely this timeâ€”in a narrow room; with the sea opposite. I watched the porpoises, & some reflections of people walking on the beach. And she cried; & was very dismal; & then rambled off about Caterham 50 years ago; & the Stannards, & how Herbert had rolled all the way down stairs, & drank so much milk that people were astonished. Nothing of life, as we see it, remains to herâ€”only this curious lit up page of the past, which she turns over & over lying in bed; & cant read or sleep, yet anxiously demands, does Leonard think she will get well? We had been saying driving down that one should take poison. She has every reason; & yet demands more life, more life, at 78. She quarrels; she cant walk; she is alone; she is looked after by nurses; lives in an hotel, but demands more life, more life. One odd thing she said was that she had slept with a governess as a child who had given her a terrible disease, & been expelled from Holland on that account. I fancy she had never told anyone this; it was her offering of intimacy to us; a thanksgiving perhaps for our having come. I was moved by her; could hardly speak. I suppose human nature, so emotional, so irrational, so instinctive, as it is in her, but not in me, has this beauty; this what they call â€˜elementalâ€™ quality. One may get it too, when one is 76. One may lie sobbing, & yet cry does doctor think I shall recover? One will not perhaps go to the writing table & write that simple & profound paper upon suicide which I see myself leaving for my friends. What a day it wasâ€”the sea flowing in & out of the bays, all the way, like the Adriatic, or Pacific; & the sand yellow; & the boats steaming along; & behind the downs like long waves, gently extending themselves, to break very quickly; smooth & sloping like the waves. Even bungalows are all burnt up & made part of this beauty; made of vapour not zinc. We voted at Rodmell. I saw a white gloved lady helping an old farm couple out of her Daimler. We have bought a motor lawn mower. I liked Francis last night. He is so abundant & fertile, so generous & warm hearted A most divine manâ€”a man I adoreâ€”these phrases recur. And then he amused me with his imitation of Esther talking like Macaulay. When they read the results he was always talking so loud: & had to stop short. We called in on Long Barn & left Pinker, & here we are again after one of these little journeys which seem to have lastâ ed 600 years. Everything looks a little strange & symbolical when one comes back. I was in a queer mood, thinking myself very old: but now I am a woman againâ€”as I always am when I write. It is scattering & heatening, this motoring about.
