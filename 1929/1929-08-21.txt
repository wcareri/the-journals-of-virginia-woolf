### Wednesday 21 August

Geoffrey Scott died last week of pneumonia in New York. Let me think what I can remember of him. I met him first in 1909 at Florence at Mrs Berensonâ€™s. We went out for lunch, & he was there; & they discussed Francis Thompson. Afterwards we went to a party at Mrs Rossâ€™s: Mary came in with a brother, both disguised as Barnes, & had to reveal themselves as Stracheys before Mrs Ross would take any interest. Then she emphasised the fact that she was Meredithâ€™s mistress, leading us all down a lawn;â€”a terrace I suppose, overlooking Fiesole. I was unhappy that summer, & bitter in all my judgments; & cannot remember anything of Geoffrey Scott save that he was part of that unnatural Florentine society; & therefore in my mood, rather contemptibleâ€”long & familiar & aesthetic & at his ease, where I was rustic, provincial & badly dressed. This impression then waits without a second till that summer evening, in 1925, I think, at Long Barn. I had motored down with Dotty & Vita for my first visit & had sat shyly in the motor observing their endearments rather awkwardly, & how they stopped the Rolls Royce to buy great baskets of strawberries; & again I felt, not provincial, but ill-dressed, under-equipped; & so stepped on to the terrace at Long Barn; & forth came Geoffrey, smiling a little superciliously, as of old; & shook hands. Harold was behind him, much more downright & burly & to my taste. That night we sat in the long room, & after Harold had grown sleepy sitting on the fender knocking his head against the fringe of the Italian cover on the mantelpice, Geoffrey sat with us, & was drawn by Dotty into telling stories for my amusement. He did this very well; I remember, though I dont remember what the stories were about. He was a very clever man, I thought; & I tried to place him, & concluded that he had some grudge against me as member of a circle he somehow respected but was not of; told me, I remember, that he could not distinguish an article by me in the Nation from one by Morgan or Lyttonâ€”we all wrote the same ironic styleâ€”& that I felt was said by way of showing meâ€”& we were the two scallywags at that particular partyâ€”that he was up to our little ways & had no respect for them. Then next day we went over Knole, where again, as at Florence, he was very much at his ease, & knew every piece of furniture or silver & called Lord Sackville Lionel as if he had known him & Vita familiarly many years, just as he had known the Rosses & the Berensons. And he was tall, & dark & had the distinguished face of a failure; reminded me a little of Bernard Holland & other â€˜brilliantâ€™ young men, who remain â€˜brilliantâ€™ & young well into the 40ties & never do anything to prove it. Harold walked back through the Park to think out some speech about Byron, simply & straightforwardly, rather to my & I think Geoffreyâ€™s amusement. The othersâ€”Dotty Vita & Geoffreyâ€”took me to the station; & I said goodbye to him there, & never spoke to him again. I had the feeling that he & Dotty & Vita & Harold were all a set; very intimate & familiar, & indeed said so, when they challenged me, as usual, with Bloomsbury & its closed walls. â€œBut you are the sameâ€”you make me feel that you are all very intimateâ€ I said, & they half denied it; but only half. For, as I learnt later, I had broken in upon the height of his affair with Vita. It was flaming very strongly that particular month, or week; it was the time when she returned his passion, for a moment; when he was swearing that she must leave Harold & live with him. After that, my intercourse with him was only by hearsayâ€”through messagesâ€”Karin said her mother wished her to arrange a meeting between Geoffrey & meâ€”& then through Vitaâ€™s explanations, later, when she told me how he was waiting for her, had left his Villa Medici & Lady Sybil on her account; & was now fuming in a mews off Regentâ€™s Park expecting her while she sat at Tavistock Square talking to me. One night, she said, he almost strangled herâ€”seized her by the throat; & she turned black & he was frightened. And I heard how furious he was on the downs above Rodmell that summer, late at night, when they were driving home, from Lady Sackville I suppose. Vita saw lights in the valley & said that I was down there asleep. Whereupon he flew into another rageâ€”they were calling the dogs who had gone hunting, & the wind blew his hat off. He called me â€˜that womanâ€™. And I saw him, in full evening dress, at the ballet with Sybil. And then never again. He is dead in New York, & all those papers about Boswellâ€”what will become of them; & the life that was to have made him immortal will never be written; & he remains the brilliant young man for ever.

And I have turned over two pages by mistake. Perhaps I can think of some other figure to write in there, going backwards, before I need go in: & it is a lovely evening; & I want to stay out here writing, & trying my new pen.

Nobody has died, to my knowledge, of much interest. And if it comes to putting down talk, the truth is that, except in novels, people donâ€™t talk.

Well, Bernard Holland, as I have mentioned him. But I cannot put my hand on any first meeting or even second. I believe I first heard him mentioned when I was say ten years old; & he had just become engaged to Helen Duckworth. Stella said to mother, â€œBut can they know what he thinks then?â€â€”or words which made me surmise that there was something dark & queer about this young man; something that to Stella seemed incongruous with the rusticity & conventionality of her Duckworth aunt & uncle. Then that little light, revealing as it was, goes out; & there is only hearsay about Bernard till, in 1902 or 3 perhaps, Dorothea took me uninvited to stay at Canterbury with Canon Holland; & there was Bernard; & he was saturnine, with his great eyebrows almost meeting; & his sunk cheeks; & his gloom; & his height; & about him there hung, now more authentically, that reputation for brilliance & strangeness that was his, years ago, at Cambridge. Poor old Bernardâ€”heâ€™s a genius, I once heard Harry Stephen say. He interested me because I imputed to him â€˜imaginationâ€™â€”the quality I most admired & missed most in my father & his agnostic friends. Bernard had edited his motherâ€™s letters, & I liked them in a sentimental way, seeing in them something imaginative, too; something that was coloured & pensive & intimate, unlike anything the Stephen family produced. So that I looked at Bernard in the low room under the Cathedral with interest, & even hoped he might think me clever or imaginative or something. But I doubt that he detached me from the shadow of Dorothea. He was occupied & mysterious, in touch with politics & Cabinet ministers; highly thought of by the Lytteltons, & vaguely credited with being himself much more able & capable than they were; but he was too much of a genius, too queer & individual, so people said, to do anything for himself. And Helen played up to this version of Bernard very femininely; wandering about vague eyed, cherry cheeked, ecstatic, religious; like some woman I thought in a novel by Charlotte Yonge. We were taken to see a sister of Mary Sibyllaâ€™s, & she said, clasping her tea cup, that whenever she heard thunder she imagined that someone had been killed by it. There was all that kind of imagination afloat. Bernard stalked about in it, aloof, intellectual, silent; appreciative perhaps, but never said so. Helen played little melancholy scraps of Beethoven; which moved me; but Bernard snapped â€œWhats that? Gilbert & Sullivan?â€ to snub her sentimentality I suppose. And then, when there was talk of going back in the train together, he stopped it. He said that he must be alone & work. So I suppose I made no impression; & received one that was not altogether favourable. A sort of false gloom was his I thought; unless indeed he were tremendously imaginative. I read a book he wrote anonymously about becoming a Roman Catholic & got a faint seductive whiff of a world where people were very brilliant & thought about their souls; a semi-worldly world it seemed; rather fluent; rather too clear & plausible & pensive, but still attractive & unfamiliar. And then again I met him at Ottolineâ€™s; & then I was older, & he was more pronounced. That is he was still sardonic; cavernous; but no longer so lean, or so silent. He flirted, even I could see, with Ottoline; & had become one of those distinguished young men who are very brilliant when they dine outâ€”like Herbert Paul perhaps; they appear without their wives, who are deaf or mad; influence politics; write unsigned articles; & flirt with ladies of title. Ottoline told me that Bernard had written her a sonnet, after another dinner party. And then he turned Roman Catholic. He wrote a vast life of the Duke of Devonshire; he wrote a vast history of the Holland family; but that was all that came of his gloom & his imagination & his genius, & when he died, a year or two ago, even his friends never wrote to the Times about him.
