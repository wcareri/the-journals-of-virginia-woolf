### Sunday 17 November

A horrid date. Yes, I am feeling a little sick, a little shivery; I cant settle to anything; I am in a twitter; I try to read Mauronâ€”to writeâ€”& my lips begin forming words; I begin muttering long conversations between myself & Vita about Dotty on the telephone; about Miss Matheson: I act parts: I find myself talking aloud; I say things over & over again like this â€œI want to know if after what happened the other morning you want to give me notice? â€¦ Well, then, as you wont answer, I am afraid I must now give you notice â€¦ But I want to explain exactly why it is. After you told me to leave your room I went to Mr Woolf & said that I could not keep you as my maid any longer. But I havenâ€™t made up my mind in a hurry. I have been thinking about it since June. I tried to arrange not to order dinner so that we might avoid scenes. But the scenes at Rodmell were worse than ever. And now this is the last. I am afraid I canâ€™t go on with it. This is the 17th of Nov. I shall expect you to go on the 17th Dec.â€ Yes, this is what I have to say to Nelly at 9.30 tomorrow, & then I go to Mrs Huntâ€™s, And I am almost trembling with this nervous anticipation as I write. But it must be done.
