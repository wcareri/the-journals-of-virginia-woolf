### Saturday 13 April

Habits gradually change the face of ones life as time changes oneâ€™s physical face; & one does not know it. Here am I using this studio to sit in, & with my diary to write down here; almost always after tea I retire here. And then I never print now or address envelopes. So perhaps habit will snuff out this diary one day.

I am sordidly debating within myself the question of Nelly; the perennial question. It is an absurdity, how much time L. & I have wasted in talking about servants. And it can never be done with because the fault lies in the system. How can an uneducated woman let herself in, alone, into our lives?â€”what happens is that she becomes a mongrel; & has no roots any where. I could put my theory into practice by getting a daily of a civilised kind, who had her baby in Kentish town; & treated me as an employer, not friend. Here is a fine rubbish heap left by our parents to be swept.

It is very quiet & very cold. I walked Pinka through the Saturday streets this afternoon & was woken to the fact that it is April by a primrose on the pavement. I had been thinking I was on one of my January walks, with lights lit at 3.30 in peoples bedrooms. Rodmell was impracticable because of the cold; & until I have a room, I cannot go there meaning to work.

We always do mean to work.

I have just agreed to do another 4 articles for Mrs Van Doren, because she has raised her price to Â£50 an articleâ€”so that, whatever the cost, I can have my new room. And all this money is changing my habits. Iâ€™m not sure it is not the memorable fact about this springâ€”for the first time since 1912â€”16 years that isâ€”I am able to look say at blue lustre cups in a shop & decide, well why not buy them? But they cost Â£6 â€¦ But then I am making over Â£1000 a year. I can make as much as I want. This little colloquy still takes place before I can unbend my old penurious muscles. But it is always better to buy than not to buy I think.

Hugh Walpole was here the other day, from 4.30 to 7.15 alone, over the fire. The same uneasy talk as usual; brisk & breezy, hating war; & then this morbid egotism & desire to scratch the same place over & over againâ€”his own defects as a writer & how to remedy them, what they spring from; all mixed up with his normal, & usual sense of being prosperous & admiredâ€”from which, as he admits when I ask him, he gets great pleasure. He starts indeed to protest that he gives pleasure, does good, but canâ€™t bring that out in my presence; which is why he seeks my presenceâ€”a scratching stone to rid him of the worldâ€™s mud. He protests too much. On the other hand, I like these bustling vigourâ ous characters: I like talk of Russia, & war & great doings & famous peopleâ€”If I donâ€™t see them I romanticise them.

Leonard is upstairs finishing the Hogarth Press accounts. Yesterday he gave the three stall hands a bonus: Mrs C. Â£25; Belcher Â£20; Kennedy Â£20. They sent up a bunch of roses later in the day. For the first time we have made over Â£400 profit. And 7 people now depend on us; & I think with pride that 7 people depend, largely, upon my hand writing on a sheet of paper. That is of course a great solace & pride to me. Its not scribbling; its keeping 7 people fed & housed: a great big man like Percy; a carrot faced woman like Cartwright; they live on my words. They will be feeding off Women & Fiction next year for which I predict some sale. It has considerable conviction. I think that the form, half talk half soliloquy allows me to get more onto the page than any how else. It made itself up & forced itself upon me (in this formâ€”the thinking had been done & the writing stiffly & unsatisfactorily 4 times before) as I lay in bed after Berlin. I used to make it up at such a rate that when I got pen & paper I was like a water bottle turned upside down. The writing was as quick as my hand could write; too quick, for I am now toiling to revise; but this way gives one freedom & lets one leap from back to back of oneâ€™s thoughts.

Happily, for my health of soul, I am now very little noticed, & so can forget the fictitious self, for it is half so, which fame makes up for one: I can see my famous self tapering about the world. I am more comfortable when shut up, self-contained as now.

The great pleasure of money is to spend a poundâ€”as on a dinner at Richmondâ€”without accounting for itâ€”I dined there with Vita. It was cold. We drove round the Park. I saw a man leading a large cat on a chain. I saw many odd parties in the hotel. How can they come here tonight, I said? There was the old woman gorged like a vulture. The woman with her foot cocked under the table at thisÂ  angle, all through dinner: the young spark in grey with the pink carnation; the two prominenteyed daughters in velvet; & all kinds of emotions, of ridicule & interest crossing the vast room perpetually from one table to another. The waiters, I thought, are only here this one night; everything is unreal & will vanish. But it is going on precisely the same at this moment. Have you had a tiring day Miss â€”â€”? says Mrs â€”â€” leaning out to speak to her. Oh dreadfully tiring says Miss â€”â€” taking her seat at the table with the reserved private bottle of soda water. And in complete desolation she waits for the courses to be brought.
