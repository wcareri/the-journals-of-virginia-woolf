### Saturday 30 November

I fill in this page, nefariously; at the end of a morningâ€™s work. I have begun the second part of Wavesâ€”I dont know, I dont know. I feel that I am only accumulating notes for a bookâ€”whether I shall ever face the labour of writing it, God Knows. From some higher station I may be able to pull it togetherâ€”at Rodmell, in my new room. Reading The Lighthouse does not make it easier to write; nor these impending final interviews with Nelly & new servants. We had a partyâ€”dining out at the Red Lionâ€”last night; Julian & Rachel; Lyn, Hope, Plomer, Brian Howard, Nessa afterwards. Too many people, Leonard said. I dont know. I dislike B. Howard; I dislike his decadence, & protruding eyes, & unbuttoned waistcoat & floating tie. On the make, Leonard says. Plomer, on the other hand, was very plump & vigorous, fresh from the Bayswater murder; the details of which he saidâ€”how he had cleaned scraps of brain from the carpet apparentlyâ€”could not be told. The young Jewess was attacked in bed at 4 last Sunday morning by a mad husband with a razor. First he locked the door, so that she banged & kicked, with the razor slashing her all the time in vain: at last burst out, with her head hanging by the skin to die on the landing. If William had not been away that week end the Chinese man would have come to him; & he thinks, killed him too. But this is not his line, he says as a novelist; & the psychic ladies who invest the house, like the coarser kind of bug & beetle, disgust him with their sea-ants. They table turn, & hear the voice of Mrs Fripâ€”(not her name) from the other side; one, very fat with curled hair, said, â€œAnd it all happened a million years ago.â€ Disgusting, William said. His eyesâ€”the representative part of himâ€”flashed & goggled.

It is said that Hope has become a Roman Catholic on the sly. Certainly she has grown very fatâ€”too fat for a woman in middle age who uses her brains, & so I suspect the rumour is true. She has sat herself down under the shade. It is strange to see beautyâ€”she had something elegant & individualâ€”go out, like a candle flame. Julian, for instance, could not see, I think, that Hope had ever been a young & attractive woman. She has some vigour of mind though. Lyn has less than I could wish. When she has written her review, there is not much left. And her â€˜nicenessâ€™â€”housekeeping & nursing her sister who is illâ€”take the edge off. Had she Â£100, she would insure against illness, she said; because illness means that one cant work; this week, neither she nor her sister has made a penny. On that foundation it is hard to rear any very robust character; she is fretted & anxious.

Certainly it is true that if one writes a thing down one has done with it.
