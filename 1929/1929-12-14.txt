### Saturday 14 December

No I am too tired to write; have been rushed, what with the lawsuit &c; have had toothache: & so sit passive, hoping that some drops will form in my mind. By the way, the sales of A Room are unprecedentedâ€”have beaten Orlando; feels like a line running through ones fingers; orders for 100 taken as coolly as 12â€™s used to be. We have sold, I think 5500; & our next years income is made.

Had I married Lytton I should never have written anything. So I thought at dinner the other night. He checks & inhibits in the most curious way. L. may be severe; but he stimulates. Anything is possible with him. Lytton was mild & damp, like a wet autumnal leaf. Lonely, & growing elderly; so he compares notes with Clive apparently. Our case stands over till next Thursday, & will probably be settled in the intervalâ€”some compromise made. Yesterday they screwed down some windowsâ€”the law had that instant effect. The law was sad-coloured, impressive. We saw Mr Preston at 10; he was in a black court coat, with dirty white bands; a self confident sandy, polite man. What a pugnacious chap you are! I heard another K.C. say to him in court. An admirable manly atmosphereâ€”schoolboys come to responsibility they seemed; all so aquiline & definite under their frizzled grey wigs. Then the Judge (Farwell) came in. We rose. He bowed. He looked superhumanly sage, dignified, sad; the wig again cutting his forehead off & accentuating the deep reflective eyesâ€”a sallow, sodden wearied face; so intent that he was monosyllabicâ€”could not afford to open his mouth unnecessarily; merely nodded. All was over in 10 minutes I suppose. I felt the stress of it all; that man sitting there intent under his canopy in the small crowded court, never dropping a word, till 4 in the afternoon.
