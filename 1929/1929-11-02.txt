### Saturday 2 November

It takes precisely 10 days for anything to happen to a bookâ€”It is now Saturday 2nd. Nov: & the R. of ones O. has sold, I think 100 copies this morning; none before, or scarcely any, this largely due to Vitaâ€™s flamboyant broadcast. And I cant remember all the things I was intending to say,â€”like Renardâ€”the man who kept a diary of the things that occur to one.

I dreamt last night that I had a disease of the heart that would kill me in 6 months. Leonard, after some persuasion, told me. My instincts were all such as I should have, in order, & some very strong: quite unexpected, I mean voluntary, as they are in dreams, & have thus an authenticity which makes an immense, & pervading impression. First, reliefâ€”well Iâ€™ve done with life anyhow (I was lying in bed) then horror; then desire to live; then fear of insanity; then (no this came earlier) regret about my writing, & leaving this book unfinished; then a luxurious dwelling upon my friends sorrow; then a sense of death & being done with at my age; then telling Leonard that he must marry again; seeing our life together; & facing the conviction of going, when other people went on living. Then I woke, coming to the top with all this hanging about me; & found I had sold a great many copies of my book; & was asked to lunch by Madame Kallasâ€”the odd feeling of these two states of life & death mingling as I ate my breakfast feeling drowsy & heavy.
