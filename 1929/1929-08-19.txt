### Monday 19 August

I suppose dinner interrupted. And I opened this book in another train of mindâ€”to record the blessed fact that for good or bad I have just set the last correction to Women & Fiction, or a Room of Oneâ€™s Own. I shall never read it again I suppose. Good or bad? Has an uneasy life in it I think: you feel the creature arching its back & galloping on, though as usual much is watery & flimsy & pitched in too high a voice.

William Plomer has been for the week end & gone. A compressed inarticulate young man, thickly coated with a universal manner fit for all weather & people: tells a nice dry prim story; but has the wild eyes which I once noted in Tom, & take to be the true index of what goes on within. Once or twice he almost cracked his crustâ€”sitting on the stones this morning for instance.

I dont suppose you know how separate I feel myself from all my contemporaries. I am afraid I was very inadequate last night (at Charleston). I apologised for the family party. No that was delightful; except that Clive Bell seemed inharmonious. What dâ€™you think of Wyndham Lewis, of Joyce? (V.) I dont like scolds. It spoils the voice. I like old men of 80 like Moore & Yeats who have kept their minds working. â€œExactly. Thatâ€™s the precise pointâ€ (these are Williamâ€™s words). And fathers are difficult. Mine has no interest in anything. But I dont live at Pinner for choice. I dislike Roy Campbellâ€™s pose. He used to fly a kite at the end of a fishing rod. William (he said the Mr was awkward) is notably trying to be like other people: to justify his life among natives & colonels, which has given him this composure. Beside him Julian seemed a mere child, & Duncan a contemporary. May he bring Butts to see us? He is a very self-contained independent young man, determined not to be rushed in any way, & having no money at all, he gave Nelly 5/ for a tip. I think he shows up well against the Raymonds & the Frankiesâ€”is somehow solid; to their pinchbeck lustre.

I have now written myself out of a writing mood; & cannot attack melancholy, save only to note that it was much diminished by hearing Nessa say she was often melancholy & often envied meâ€”a statement I thought incredible. I have spilt myself among too many stools she said (we were sitting in her bedroom before dinner). Other peoples melancholy certainly cheers one. And now, having written my four little brief hard articles, I must think of that book again, & go down step by step into the well. These are the great events & revolutions in oneâ€™s lifeâ€”& then people talk of war & politics. I shall grind very hard; all my brakes will be stiff; my springs rusty. But I have now earned the right to some months of fiction. & my melancholy is brushed away, so soon as I can get my mind forging ahead, not circling round.
