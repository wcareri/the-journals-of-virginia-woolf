### Friday 4 January

How odd to think that I have given the world something that the world enjoysâ€”I refer to the Manchester Guardianâ€”Orlando is recognised for the masterpiece that it is. The Times does not mention Nessaâ€™s pictures. Yet, she said last night, I have spent a long time over one of them. Then I think to myself, So I have something, instead of children, & fall comparing our lives. I note my own withdrawal from those desires; my absorption in what I call, inaccurately, ideas: this vision.

We saw Koteliansky on Christmas day. Rather dryer & yellower in the cheeks, like an orange that is old. He was in his shirt sleeves. He had been washing up his Christmas dinner, which was â€œNo, not a very good one â€¦ Come in Come inâ€. This was Katherineâ€™s room he said. It is poverty stricken, tidy, cleanâ€”a bed, a table. It looks over back gardens to the trees of Regentâ€™s Park. We went straight into the old abuse of Murry; went back ten years, to Richmond, & those long visits; those difficult emphatic ways. He is, one says, the same. Very poor, as definite as ever. Still talking about Lawrence; a very very good writer but his last book DISGUSTING. You must read Counterpoint. Why? Because he is a seerious man, a cultivated man. And it is typical of the age. It is a painful book a horrid book but it is that. Still the same seriousness, & concentration upon say 5 objects which he has been staring at these 40 years. Still he gnaws the bone of Katherine & Murry. And all the time some emotion was working in him. He was glad we had come. What could he give us? He gave me a red wooden box, a Russian toy, & stuffed it full of his Russian cigarettes. His voice quivered now & then. He looked at me with emotion. All the linoleum was shining, where he had cleaned it, & he had painted the woodwork with two sorts of Reckittâ€™s blue: so that it shone very bright. He had painted it over & over. There he lives, how heaven knows. People will no longer buy his translations. His dog (a pure Jewish dog) is dead.

Now is life very solid, or very shifting? I am haunted by the two contradictions. This has gone on for ever: will last forever; goes down to the bottom of the worldâ€”this moment I stand on. Also it is transitory, flying, diaphanous. I shall pass like a cloud on the waves. Perhaps it may be that though we change; one flying after another, so quick so quick, yet we are somehow successive, & continuousâ€”we human beings; & show the light through. But what is the light? I am impressed by the transitoriness of human life to such an extent that I am often saying a farewellâ€”after dining with Roger for instance; or reckoning how many more times I shall see Nessa.
