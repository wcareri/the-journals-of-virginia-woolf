### Sunday 13 October

It comes to me to ask, how far could I live at this moment in Nessa being with Angelica at school? Can one supplement oneâ€™s life? I think a little. Julian has driven her over from Cambridge, this still soft grey morning. It is sunny & misty in the country. She got into the car in the Kingâ€™s Parade, where the paper sellers are & the young men are hurrying I suppose along to breakfast. Then they drive, with a map on their knees; Julian rather tense, staring through his spectacles. Some very intimate things are hinted atâ€”of wh. I know nothingâ€”or rather he grunts & half says things, which she understands. She is very excited, at the same time practical. Julian is excited too. They are both very anxious to see Angelica. How will they see her first? She will come running down the stairs into the private room, on the left; with the Adams fireplace. And then? She will â€˜fly into Nessaâ€™s armsâ€™. Nessa will hold her very tight to get the sensation of her childâ€™s body again. Julian will call her â€œdearâ€. They will go out together into the park. Angelica will like to show off her knowledge of rules & ways & the best places to sit in; other girls will smile, & she will say â€˜Thats Claudiaâ€™ or Annie. Thats Miss Collyâ€”Thats Mrs Curtis. And all the time they will be feeling the comfort & excitement of being togetherâ€”of having only just broached their time together. Nessa will get at ever so many things: questions of happiness, teaching, liking, lonelinessâ€”change. They will be very proud of each other & aloof. & Julian will peer about, through his glasses, liking Nessa & Angelica better than anybody I daresay; the simple crude boyâ€”whom I shall now never know, I daresay. Forâ€”as I am going to say to Nessa on Wednesdayâ€”you are a jealous woman, & dont want me to know your sons, dont want to take, but always to give; are afraid of the givers. What will she answer?

But Leonard will go on moving the apples, & so I cannot write anything except myâ€”what I am pleased to callâ€”my diary. I wish I could write more succinctly, by the way, & with less use of the present participle. My carelessness shocks me. Nature is having her revenge, & is now making me write one word an hour.
