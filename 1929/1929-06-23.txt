### Sunday 23 June

It was very hot that day, driving to Worthing to see Leonardâ€™s mother, my throat hurt me. Next morning I had a headache. So we stayed on at Rodmell till today. At Rodmell I read through the Common Reader; & this is very importantâ€”I must learn to write more succinctly. Especially in the general idea essays like the last, How it strikes a Contemporary, I am horrified by my own looseness. This is partly that I dont think things out first; partly that I stretch my style to take in crumbs of meaning. But the result is a wobble & diffusity & breathlessness which I detest. One must correct A room of oneâ€™s own very carefully before printing. And so I pitched into my great lake of melancholy. Lord how deep it is! What a born melancholiac I am! The only way I keep afloat is by working. A note for the summer I must take more work than I can possibly get done. (I am)â€”no, I dont know what it comes from. Directly I stop working I feel that I am sinking down, down. And as usual, I feel that if I sink further I shall reach the truth. That is the only mitigation; a kind of nobility. Solemnity. I shall make myself face the fact that there is nothingâ€”nothing for any of us. Work, reading, writing are all disguises; & relations with people. Yes, even having children would be useless.

We went into the beechwood by the Race Course. I like these woods; & the waters of the greenery closing over one; so shallow, with the sun on them; then so deep in the shade. And I like the beech boughs, laced about, very intricate; like many arms; & the trunks, like the stone pillars in a church. But if I were Mrs Bartholomew I should certainly do something violent. This thought kept coming to me. What though could one do, at the bottom of that weightâ ; with that incubus of injustice on top of one? Annie Thompsett & her baby live on 15/ a week. I throw away 13/- on cigarettes, chocolates, & bus fares. She was eating rice pudding by the babyâ€™s cradle when I came in.

However, I now begin to see the Moths rather too clearly, or at least strenuously, for my comfort. I think it will begin like this: dawn; the shells on a beach; I dont knowâ€”voices of cock & nightingale; & then all the children at a long tableâ€”lessons. The beginning. Well, all sorts of characters are to be there. Then the person who is at the table can call out any one of them at any moment; & build up by that person the mood, tell a story; for instance about dogs or nurses; or some adventure of a childs kind; all to be very Arabian nights; & so on: this shall be Childhood; but it must not be my childhood; & boats on the pond; the sense of children; unreality; things oddly proportioned. Then another person or figure must be selected. The unreal world must be round all thisâ€”the phantom waves. The Moth must come in: the beautiful single moth. There must be a flower growing.

Could one not get the waves to be heard all through? Or the farmyard noises? Some odd irrelevant noises. She might have a bookâ€”one book to read inâ€”another to write inâ€”old letters.

Early morning lightâ€”but this need not be insisted on; because there must be great freedom from â€˜realityâ€™. Yet everything must have relevance.

Well all this is of course the â€˜realâ€™ life; & nothingness only comes in the absence of this. I have proved this quite certainly in the past half hour. Everything becomes green & vivified in me when I begin to think of the Moths. Also, I think, one is much better able to enter into otherâ€™sâ€”
