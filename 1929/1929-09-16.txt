### Monday 16 September

Leonard is having a picnic at Charleston & I am hereâ€”â€˜tiredâ€™. But why am I tired? Well I am never alone. This is the beginning of my complaint. I am not physically tired so much as psychologically. I have strained & wrung at journalism & proof correction; & underneath has been forming my Moths book. Yes, but it forms very slowly; & what I want is not to write it, but to think it for two or three weeks sayâ€”to get into the same current of thought & let that submerge everything, writing perhaps a few phrases here at my window in the morning. (And theyâ€™ve gone to some lovely placeâ€”Hurstmonceux perhaps, in this strange misty evening;â€”& yet when the time came to go, all I wanted was to walk off into the hills by myself. I am now feeling a little lonely & deserted & defrauded, inevitably). And every time I get into my current of thought I am jerked out of it. We have the Keynesâ€™s: then Vita came; then Angelica & Eve; then we went to Worthing, then my head begins throbbingâ€”so here I am, not writingâ€”that does not matter, but not thinking, feeling or seeingâ€”& seizing an afternoon alone as a treasureâ€”Leonard appeared at the glass door at this moment; & they didnâ€™t go to Hâ urstmonceuâ x or anywhere; & Sprott was there & a miner, so I missed nothingâ€”oneâ€™s first egotistical pleasure.

Really these premonitions of a bookâ€”states of soul in creatingâ€”are very queer & little apprehended.

Another reflectionâ€”nothing is so tiring as a change of atmosphere. I am more shattered & dissipated by an hour with Leonardâ€™s mother than by 6 hoursâ€”no, 6 days, of Vita. (Nessa doesnâ€™t count). The tremendous gear changing that has to take place grinds oneâ€™s machinery to bits. And I have done this constantlyâ€”& what is more than doing it, Iâ€™ve foreboded doing itâ€”Iâ€™ve counted up the days & felt Worthing brooding over me. & then, psychologically again, having Nelly in the car is to me a strainâ€”imposes another forced atmosphere. None of these things would matter much if oneâ€™s engine were going at full speedâ€”how I tossed off every interruption when I was writing Orlando!â€”but it is as if they got in to the spokesâ€”clogged the wheelsâ€”always just prevented me from getting the machine swinging round. And then I am 47: yes: & my infirmities will of course increase. To begin with my eyes. Last year, I think, I could read without spectacles; wd. pick up a paper & read it in a tube; gradually I found I needed spectacles in bed; & now I canâ€™t read a line (unless held at a very odd angle) without them. My new spectacles are much stronger than the old, & when I take them off, I am blinded for a moment. What other infirmities? I can hear, I think, perfectly: I think I could walk as well as ever. But then will there not be the change of life? And may that not be a difficult & even dangerous time? Obviously one can get over it by facing it with common senseâ€”that it is a natural process; that one can lie out here & read; that oneâ€™s faculties will be the same afterwards; that one has nothing to worry about in one senseâ€”Iâ€™ve written some interesting books, can make money, can afford a holidayâ€”Oh no; one has nothing to bother about; & these curious intervals in lifeâ€”Iâ€™ve had manyâ€”are the most fruitful artisticallyâ€”one becomes fertilisedâ€”think of my madness at Hogarth & all the little illnessesâ€”that before I wrote To The Lighthouse for instance. Six weeks in bed now would make a masterpiece of Moths. But that wont be the name. Moths, I suddenly remember, dont fly by day. And there cant be a lighted candle. Altogether, the shape of the book wants consideringâ€”& with time I could do it.

Here I broke off.
