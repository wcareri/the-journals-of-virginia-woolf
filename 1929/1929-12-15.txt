### Sunday 15 December

Tooth better, but not what I call a vigorous head; an idling, unconcentrated headâ€”too much doing in Tavistock Sqre these last days. Last night we went to The Calendar (by Edgar Wallace) with Ann; & there was a cheer, & behold a great golden Queen bowing in a very small bow windowed box. Also, when the lights went up, the King, red, grumpy, fidgeting with his hands; well groomed, bluff; heavy looking, with one white flower in his buttonhole, resenting the need, perhaps, of sitting to be looked at between one of the actsâ€”his duty to be done; & then not much liking the little remarks cast at him, to minimise his labour, by the Queen. Once the Dâ ucheâ ss of York sat with the Queen; a simple, chattering, sweethearted little roundfaced young woman in pink: but her wrist twinkling with diamonds, her dress held on the shoulder with diamonds. The Queen also like a lit up street with diamonds. An odd feeling came to me of the shop window decorated for the public: these our exhibits, our show pieces. Not very impressiveâ€”no romance or mysteryâ€”the very best goods. Yet he descends, I daresay, from Hengist; goes straight back, this heavy bluff grumpy looking man, to Elizabeth & the rest; will have his face forever in our history. He took spectacles out of a bright red case.

I thought (as I so often think things) of many comments to be written. One remains. If I were reading this diary, if it were a book that came my way, I think I should seize with greed upon the portrait of Nelly, & make a storyâ€”perhaps make the whole story revolve round thatâ€”it would amuse me. Her characterâ€”our efforts to be rid of herâ€”our reconciliations.
