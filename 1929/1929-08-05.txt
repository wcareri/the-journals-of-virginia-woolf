### Monday 5 August

Yes that is the date, & the last was June 30thâ€”a tribute to the helter skelter random rackety summer I spent. Far the pleasantest memories, standing out like greenweed on some civet grey pond, were the week ends here: the divine fresh week ends, with the hay cutting & the lights lambent; Leonardâ€™s new room, Hedgehog Hall a-building, & my lodge being made into the palace of comfort which it now is. For I am now sitting here, oppressed by the Bank holiday atmosphere which gets into the wild country air, the lonely marshes, & makes the village seem smug & suburban. The girls & men are playing stool ball; Leonard & Percy are making a pipe conduct water into the Pond. It is a chocolate brown, & lived in by small fish. Yes it was a scattered summer; I felt as if the telephone were strung to my arm & anybody could jerk me who liked. A sense of interruption bothered me. And then these people one â€˜seesâ€™â€”how blurred the image becomes! What damp blotting paper my mind was, as I left Ottolineâ€™s on Thursday afternoon, & determined not to speak to another soul. There is a sort of irreverence in treating thus the venerable soul of man: one curses it, & bites it & gets embittered by it. More pleasure is to be had from one nights talk with old dunderheaded Ka than from these flittering & glitterings. In London I should only have girded at her. Here, spreading herself out in her slow heavy footed way one took in an easy half critical, half appreciative impressionâ€”the chief element being amusement at her protestations. When the story was not to her credit as a social centre, it was to his as a speaker, politician, gardener, artist, husband, thinkerâ€”everything. Indeed I cut her short this morning, as she exalted his brain, by saying we all live on illusion; Willâ€™s brain is one of them. Thus pulled up she jibbed a moment, & then recovered, & saw the sense; not quite, perhaps; but in her slow way, larded over with these shams & gentilities & politics & appearances, she is honest too. And we talked about Rupert. But my reflectionâ€”every visit leaves one with a reflectionâ€”was this, about talking in protest, to impress, its futility, its universality: only she is more open & insistent, for some reason, than we areâ€”or so I hope. Take away that motive from oneâ€™s talk, & how much would be left? How often donâ€™t I vaguely feel blessing my sentence, the face of my own vanity, which demands that I shall pay it this tribute.

And then Iâ€™m cross with Vita: she never told me she was going abroad for a fortnightâ€”didnt dare; till the last moment, when she said it was a sudden plan. Lord Lord! I am half amused though; why do I mind? what do I mind? how much do I mind? I shall fire up & accuse her, & see to the bottom of her vessel. One of the facts is that these Hildas are a chronic case; & as this one wonâ€™t disappear & is unattached, she may be permanent. And, like the damned intellectual snob I am, I hate to be linked, even by an arm, with Hilda. Her earnest aspiring competent wooden face appears before me, seeking guidance in the grave question of whoâ€™s to broadcast. A queer trait in Vitaâ€”her passion for the earnest middle-class intellectual, however drab & dreary. And why do I write this down? I have not even told Leonard; & whom do I tell when I tell a blank page? The truth is, I get nearer feelings in writing than in walkingâ€”I think: graze the bone; enjoy the expression; have them out of me; make them a little creditable to myself; I daresay suppress something, so that after all Iâ€™m doing what amounts to confiding. Why did Pepys write his diary after all?

I should be tackling Mary Wollstonecraft. I am in the thick of my four Herald articles, thus cutting into my Moths (but I had proofs of A Room to correct) & hope to be quit of it all by August 14th & then go down step by step into that queer region. I must make a great try for itâ€”for this difficult bookâ€”& after that? Always adventure: with that sense to guide me, I shant stagnate anyhow.

You can choose between us, I say, stopping writing; & get some satisfaction from making up caustic phrases. Yet Iâ€™m not very caustic, only by starts.
