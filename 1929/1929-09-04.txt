### Wednesday I think the 4 September

I am just back from Long Barn, that is from Ashdown forest, where L. fetched me; & I have just eaten a pear warm from the sun with the juice running out of it, & I have thought of this device: to put

The Lonely Mind

separately in The Moths, as if it were a person. I donâ€™t knowâ€”it seems possible. And these notes show that I am very happy.

I daresay it is the hottest day this yearâ€”the hottest September day these twenty years. So the papers may say tomorrow. Really it was too hot in the garden at Long Barn. The children were querulousâ€”Nigel riding round in between the flower beds on his bicycle, & Ben stretched on the seat saying in a reasonable sad voice, Nigel you arenâ€™t wellâ€”you dont look well. Boski says you dont. Mummy he ought to wash his feet. Vita (from the window) but he has washed his feet. Ben. Well theyâ€™re dirty again. Boski came in with the time table. The buses dont fit. They cant get back from Fairlawn before 8. Vita. Then ring up Mrs Cazalet & say they cant come. I must tell them they must put it off. She went to Haroldâ€™s room where they sat working with Mr Oâ€™Connor, & told them. Nigel began arguing. She was firm, & strode away. All this happened in blazing heat. The car was very hot. George brought a bottle of soda water. We lunched among some pine trees in Ashdown Forest, & lay full length afterwards, I with my straw hat over my face. Then L. met us, punctually at 4, at Duddimans (noâ€”not that name) & we sat on some prickly holly leaves on the heath & talked to Vita about Haroldâ€™s letter. He says her poems arenâ€™t worth publishing. She is very calm & modest, & seems not to mind muchâ€”a less touchy poet never was. But then can a real poet be an un-touchy poet?

She was very much as usual ?; striding; silk stockings; shirt & skirt; opulent; easy; absent; talking spaciously & serenely to the Eton tutor, an admirable young man, with straight nose & white teeth who went to bed, or to his room, early, leaving us alone. I remarked the boys calling him Sir & bending with salaams over his hand & then kissing Vitaâ€”how Englishâ€”how summery & how upper classâ€”how pleasantâ€”how without accent. This has been going on a thousand years I felt; at least, I can remember summers like thisâ€”white flannels & tennis, mothers, & tutors & English houses & dinner with moths getting in the candles & talk of tennis tournaments & ladies asking one to tea all my lifeâ€”so pleasant, so without accent. And the tutor was the eternal tutor of young menâ€”joking, affectionate, stern: watching Nigel with a sort of amusement & tenderness â€œThere spoke the real Nigelâ€ when N. said he hoped he had spilt the gravy on his trousers:â€”like a stream flowing deep & correct & unruffled through narrow banks. This kind of thing we now do to perfection. It is not interesting, but from its admirable completeness & sameness makes one tender towards it.

Nelly has been out this afternoon & picked, I think, 7 lbs of blackberries to make into jam. Please remember this as her way of thanking me for having Lottieâ€”after all, she has no other. And one tends to forget it.
