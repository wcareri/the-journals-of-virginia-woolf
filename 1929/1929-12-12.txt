### Thursday 12 December

Here, just back from Rodmell, & some rather forced conversation with Mr Philcox (the wife & I went to Americaâ€”I dont like Americaâ€”you pay separate for breakfastâ€”room, double 24 dollars). I will rapidly note my evidence for tomorrow though Pritchard now says we shall be postponedâ€”for the hotel cant get a witness. What I shall sayâ€”(I have the pump all right,) is this about the autumn.

We came back early in October & the music was very bad. My husband wrote to the Secretary who wrote & assured him that everything wd. be done. Next night the music was so bad that my husband rang up the hotel; but they said they could do nothing. The music slightly improved, & we waited till the end of Nov. when it became so bad we were unable to sit in the room. The party was on 29th: on the 30th it was intolerable.

How easily facts escape me!
