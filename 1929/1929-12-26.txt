### Thursday 26 December

And I am sitting in my new roomâ€”bedroom, not sitting room; with curtains fire table; & two great views; sometimes sun over the brooks & storm over the church. A violent Christmas; a brilliant serene Boxing day; & both very happyâ€”completely, were it not for the damnable Byng-Stamper & his power to sell the down to a syndicate to exploit. That this is his intention comes through Percy; & I am wrought up to protest; indeed I must write to Ottoline & ask her the name of the little man who protects downs. This place is always being risked & saved; & so perhaps will be again. Cutting down trees & spoiling downs are my two great iniquitiesâ€”what the Armenians were to Mrs Cole. I find it almost incredibly soothingâ€”a fortnight aloneâ€”almost impossible to let oneself have it. Relentlessly we have crushed visitorsâ€”Morgan, Roger, Adrian. We will be alone this once, we say; & really, it seems possible. Then Annie is to me very sympathetic; my bread bakes well. All is rather rapt, simple, quick effectiveâ€”except for my blundering on at The Waves. I write two pages of arrant nonsense, after straining; I write variations of every sentence; compromises; bad shots; possibilities; till my writing book is like a lunaticâ€™s dream. Then I trust to some inspiration on re-reading; & pencil them into some sense. Still I am not satisfied. I think there is something lacking. I sacrifice nothing to seemliness. I press to my centre. I dont care if it all is scratched out. And there is something there. I incline now to try violent shotsâ€”at Londonâ€”at talkâ€”shouldering my way ruthlesslyâ€”& then, if nothing comes of itâ€”anyhow I have examined the possibilities. But I wish I enjoyed it more. I dont have it in my head all day like The Lighthouse & Orlando.

Before I went Clive came to tea; sat alone for an hour or two. He asked me if I had been told that he had criticised A Room? I said no. He was a little rasped; said the jokes were lecture jokes. â€œGirls come round meâ€â€”too much of thatâ€”little ideasâ€”nothing to compare with Orlando. And then, inconsistently, he praised O. above Lâ ighthouse against what he said at the time. But his criticism is founded upon the theory that I cant feel sex: have the purple light cut off; & therefore must write Orlandoâ€™s not Lighthouses. I daresay thereâ€™s some truthâ€”especially in his saying that my soliloquies, trains of thought, are better than my silhouettes. But, as always, his own axe wants grinding: that Love is enoughâ€”or if love fails, down one goes for ever. For we got on Mary of course; & again he protested that no one could have acted other than he didâ€”& then he vaguely threatened an alliance, in France, with his lovedâ€”or the lady who loves. But does she love? Does she take him to Egypt? All trembles now on some unreality. Everything has been shifted by Mary; no fundament left. And I always feel, how jolly, how much hunting, & talking & carousing there is in you! How long we have known each otherâ€”& then Thobyâ€™s form looms behindâ€”that queer ghost. I think of death sometimes as the end of an excursion which I went on when he died. As if I should come in & say well, here you are. And yet I am not familiar with him now, perhaps. Those letters Clive read made him strange & external.

But a dog barks, & my lamp flickersâ€”even in my perfect room. So down to Leonard, to read Elizabethans & put our glass dish on the fire.
