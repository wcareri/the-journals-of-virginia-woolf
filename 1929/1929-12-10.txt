### Tuesday 10 December

A bad day yesterday, because I had Vita to lunch, which I hate, & lost one of my green leather gloves. We had tea with Leonardâ€™s mother, who, sitting in a new room, fairly flabbergasted us by her accident. The hotel was struck by lightning on Friday; a chimney stack fell; her room was filled with soot & sparksâ€”& there she was, dramatising it, shivering, shocked, yet buoyant & secretly pleased to be the centre of catastrophe again. As usual she had behaved with perfect calmâ€”â€œbut I feel these things so much afterwardsâ€ & was anxious to give pounds of tobacco to the workmen engaged in mending the roof. â€œWhat right, I said to myself, have we to sit here & see those poor fellows carrying bricks? Oh their livesâ€”carrying bricks to the roof in this galeâ€”& I sitting hereâ€ (in a pink hotel bedroom). This is her fluid imaginationâ€”pounds of tobacco, as Harold Woolf said, wdnâ€™t do much to cure the social system.

It is I think a proof of the pressure at which we live that I have said nothing of our lawsuitâ€”or have I? against the hotel, against the jazz band. Rachel, William Plomer & ourselves go to court on Friday. Why are the facts so intolerably dull? I shrink from writing them. I rather liked Scadding & Bodkinâ€™s office; & swearing by almighty God; but Rachel & Wm. enjoy it more than I do. It is more unexpected. Rachel will tell her friends about itâ€”as I should have done. But whole days knocked out of the week bore me. I feel that my greatest triumph is to achieve a quiet eveningâ€”in which to read Elâ izabeâ thans. And Charlie Sanger is very illâ€”I figure him lying worn out, worn out & without much solid happiness to show for it; like some old gold linkâ€”so good, so genuine; affectionate; honourable; but a worn disappointed man I think: no natural happiness: a conscience; & then Dora.
