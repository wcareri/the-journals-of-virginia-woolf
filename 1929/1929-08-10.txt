### Saturday 10 August

Well, Heaven be praised; it is all over & calm & settled. Nellyâ€”how long ago that seems!â€”is stayingâ€”Yes, we found we cdnt get Mrs Thomsett; & I had two minutes of energetic courage; & so, Nelly saying, she thoughtâ€”but Iâ€™m too bored. And Iâ€™m too deliciously relieved to have seen Vita this moment & find that her story to me was precisely trueâ€”& she brought documents to prove itâ€”& was very upsetâ€”& had gone like a donkey & telephoned to Hildaâ€”who is also very upset, & was altogether so simple & sincere & saw that my position was reasonableâ€”oh yes, she could not have stood it a momentâ€”but why, I ask myself, does it bore me so insufferably to write down what is so acutely exciting at the moment? My own lack of narrative power. Indeed I was more worried & angry & hurt & caustic about this affair than I let on, even to the blank page; yet afraid too of exaggeration. Of course, one is right about Nellyâ€”right that she is, in bad moods almost insufferably mean, selfish & spiteful; butâ€”& this is an interesting psychological remark, she is in a state of nature; untrained; uneducated, to me almost incredibly without the power of analysis or logic; so that one sees a human mind wriggling undressedâ€”which is interesting; & then, in the midst of oneâ€™s horror at the loathesome spectacle, one is surprised by the goodness of human nature, undressed; & it is more impressive because of its undress. For example, she thought I had given her notice permanently; but instead of giving way,â€”& yet she had nowhere to go toâ€”to rage or spite, she bicycled into Lewes to get us cream for dinner: the motive being genuine I think; we must not suffer; & how could she leave us without a cook? It is this mixture that one canâ€™t understand; & that makes one always plunge so heavily in dealing with her. She said too that she would find it very difficult to get a place; since it is all the fashion now to engage cooks only who will live out (& this sentence is another example of my inability to write narrative). And it will happen again, her spite & meanness; but we shanâ€™t part now, I think. And Iâ€™m half pleased to find that it is harder to part after 15 years than I thought. And Iâ€™m pleasedâ€”oh very pleasedâ€”about Vita.
