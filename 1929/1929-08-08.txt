### Thursday 8 August

This is written to while away one of those stupendous momentsâ€”one of those painful, ridiculous, agitating moments which make one half sick & yet I dont knowâ€”Iâ€™m excited too; & feel free & then sordid; & unsettled; & so onâ€”Iâ€™ve told Nelly to go; after a series of scenes which I wont bore myself to describe. And in the midst of the usual anger, I looked into her little shifting greedy eyes, & saw nothing but malice & spite there, & felt that that had come to be the reality now: she doesnâ€™t care for me, or for anything: has been eaten up by her poor timid servants fears & cares & respectabilities. And so at lunch L. & I settled it; & I spoke two words, which she almost pulled out of my mouth in her eagerness to show herself delighted & eager & hard & untouchedâ€”a sordid painful scene after 15 years; but then how many I have had, & how degrading they are. & if we dont break now we drift on endlesslyâ€”oh but all these old arguments I know by heart. Whats new & strange is to have made an end of it, for though we only speak of her staying away till October, I dont think we shall ever begin again. This is an occasion for some of the small virtues of lifeâ€”cheerfulness, & decision, & the determination to start fresh & better. In truth we never should have gone on, I daresay, if it hadnâ€™t been for the war; I dont know: Iâ€™m confirmed in my wish to have no resident servants ever again. That is the evil which rots the relationship. But now I must go to Annie Thomsett again.
