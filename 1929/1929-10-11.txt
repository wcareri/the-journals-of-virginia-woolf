### Friday 11 October

And I snatch at the idea of writing here in order not to write Waves or Moths or whatever it is to be called. One thinks one has learnt to write quickly; & one hasnâ€™t. And what is odd, Iâ€™m not writing with gusto or pleasure: because of the concentration. I am not reeling it off; but sticking it down. Also, never, in my life, did I attack such a vague yet elaborate design; whenever I make a mark I have to think of its relation to a dozen others. And though I could go on ahead easily enough, I am always stopping to consider the whole effect. In particular is there some radical fault in my scheme? I am not quite satisfied with this method of picking out things in the room & being reminded by them of other things. Yet I cant at the moment devise anything which keeps so close to the original design & admits of movement.

Hence, perhaps, these October days are to me a little strained & surrounded with silence. What I mean by this last word I dont quite know, since I have never stopped â€˜seeingâ€™ peopleâ€”Nessa & Roger, the Jeffersâ€™, Charles Buxton, & should have seen Lord David & am to see the Eliotsâ€”oh & there was Vita too. No; its not physical silence; its some inner lonelinessâ€”interesting to analyse if one could. To give an exampleâ€”I was walking up Bedford Place is itâ€”the straight street with all the boarding houses this afternoon, & I said to myself spontaneously, something like this. How I suffer, & no one knows how I suffer, walking up this street, engaged with my anguish, as I was after Thoby diedâ€”alone; fighting something alone. But then I had the devil to fight, & now nothing. And when I come indoors, it is all so silentâ€”I am not carrying a great rush of wheels in my headâ€”Yet I am writingâ€”oh & we are very successfulâ€”& there isâ€”what I most loveâ€”change ahead. Yes, that last evening at Rodmell when Leonard came down against his will to fetch me, the Keynesâ€™s came over. And Maynard is giving up the Nation, & so is Hubert, & so no doubt shall we. And it is autumn; & the lights are going up; & Nessa is in Fitzroy Streetâ€”in a great misty room, with flaring gas & unsorted plates & glasses on the floor,â€”& the Press is boomingâ€”& this celebrity business is quite chronicâ€”& I am richer than I have ever beenâ€”& bought a pair of earrings todayâ€”& for all this, there is vacancy & silence somewhere in the machine. On the whole, I do not much mind; because, what I like is to flash & dash from side to side, goaded on by what I call reality. If I never felt these extraordinarily pervasive strainsâ€”of unrest, or rest, or happiness, or discomfortâ€”I should float down into acquiescence. Here is something to fight: & when I wake early I say to myself, Fight, fight. If I could catch the feeling, I would: the feeling of the singing of the real world, as one is driven by loneliness & silence from the habitable world; the sense that comes to me of being bound on an adventure; of being strangely free now, with money & so on, to do anything. I go to take theatre tickets (The Matriarch) & see a list of cheap excursions hanging there, & at once think that I will go to Stratford on Avon Mob fair tomorrowâ€”why not?â€”or to Ireland, or to Edinburgh for a week end. I daresay I shant. But anything is possible. And this curious steed, life; is genuineâ€”Does any of this convey what I want to say?â€”But I have not really laid hands on the emptiness after all.

Its odd, now I come to think of itâ€”I miss Clive.

It occurs to me that Arthur Studd was another of the brilliant young men. But there was something innocent about him, compared with Bernard & Geoffrey: he spoke through his nose, & had a soft guttural voice; & a bald forehead, & rather handsome brown eyes, like a dogs: he was canine, in some ways; travelled, distinguished, rich; with a stout mother he disliked, & thus won my motherâ€™s sympathy. He had thick red hands, but painted in the manner of Whistlerâ€”gesticulating over the canvas, & then producing some little pleasing melodious still life, with which, rather mystically, he was very pleased. It was â€˜being an artistâ€™ that took his fancy. He had lovely rooms in Cheyne Walk; & the white girls & pink clouds & rivers & fireworks of Whistler hung in them. He went to Samoa, to paint Whistlers perhaps, & came back when Stella was dead & grieved for her I think. He had loved her, in his fumbling ineffective way. Then he wrote little poems, about Eton, which he loved, & hoped to be buried thereâ€”But why should he think of being buried, with all his advantages? There was something ineffective about himâ€”he could not do anything; but had, to us as children, a kind of romance; was supposed to do extravagant impossible thingsâ€”like hiring a cab & taking us all off suddenly to play cricket at Lordsâ€”that I remember. I suppose he was the flower of Eton & the 90ties, getting itself varnished with art & Paris & studio life, & Chelsea. He sent me a post card from St Ives once, & a poem about Etonâ€”& thenâ€”clap came the war; & being endlessly kind & generous & inefficient, no doubt he did great things for refugees, & died, without any notice being taken, that I am aware ofâ€”a rich bachelor; not much over 50 I suppose. Another â€˜young manâ€™â€”not brilliant exactly, but congenial in my memory, modest, fresh, unexpected, & always so nasal.
