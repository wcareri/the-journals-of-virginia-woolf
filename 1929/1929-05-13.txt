### Monday 13 May

How odd this isâ€”here I am sitting at 3.10 with nothing much to doâ€”nothing that I need do. I must take up printing again. But we have been to the Singers with the carâ€”its clutch in trouble; & as we started, up came Saxon, on his holidayâ€”Going to the Ring of course, & having a day off. For how many years has he done thisâ€”strange methodical character that he is. We dont meet for months, & take up the subject again. He took out his cheque book & said he thought the pattern was changed, with the same interest in that minute detail as he had 30 years ago. He has the same umbrella hanging by a hook on his arm; the same gold watch chain; & his pirouetting attitudes; & sprightly bird-like ways.

What then has life given you, I asked, (myself) looking at the Church at the top of Portland Street. Well, he is free to go to the Opera, to read Plato to play chess. And he will continue doing these things, as if they were the chosen things till he dies. There is a certain dignity in this steady doing of things which seem chosen. Yetâ€”thus one always ends a comparison of livesâ€”I wouldnâ€™t for the whole world live yours.

And at 4 I must change & wash & go to the Mauron lecture at Argyll House; & then to Molly & then to dine with Sibylâ€”which will, I hope finish this lap of my race. Did I say that I still think of life as a series of lapsâ€”& still take my fences dutifully & then enjoy nothingness? So if I dine with Sibyl I need not dine with Christabel. I have never got in the frame of mind which makes these fences negligible. Then we go to Rodmell for 6 days; & then home; & then to Cassis; & then home. & then Rodmell; & then the autumn; & then the winterâ€”Oh this pump! I wish I could say I never notice it. Moreover, the idea has come to me that I ought now to be re-reading my own books, for our â€˜Collected Editionâ€™. L. & Kennedy are working at a dust cover this moment. Shall I run away from my duty & the pump & go & see?

The election draws near, & the Derby. I will go upstairs & read Proust I think, since I am fabricating a few remarks on him for that cursed bookâ€”that stone that plunges me deeper & deeper in the water. The reason I dislike dining with Sibyl is that she exacts it: I am to give her a display of intimacy, which she cannot acquire, poor woman, for herself.
