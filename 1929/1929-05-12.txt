### Sunday 12 May

Here, having just finished what I call the final revision of Women & Fiction so that L. can read it after tea, I stop: surfeited. And the pump, which I was so sanguine as to think ceased, begins again. About W. & F. I am not sureâ€”a brilliant essay?â€”I daresay; it has much work in it, many opinions boiled down into a kind of jelly, which I have stained red as far as I can. But I am eager to be offâ€”to write without any boundary coming slick in ones eyes: here my public has been too close: facts; getting them malleable, easily yielding to each other.

A wet day, or we should be at Hampton Court with Roger & Mauron. And I am glad of the rain, because I have talked too much. We have seen too many peopleâ€”Sydney Waterlow perhaps the most notable, as a resurrection. A desperate looking pompous sad respectable elderly man; worldly; but quivering as usual in his shell. Any pin pricks him in the unarmoured skin. I liked him. We met in the dark hall, glad of its darkness. We talked almost too easily, of Lucy Clifford buried with a service; & then his lancers & state at Bangkokâ€”all to his liking. His importance very clear to him. At Oare he is nobody. And so he would like to go back to Bangkok & be important in the East for ever. He can seek the truth no moreâ€”has indeed seen through the search for truth, which was in him the search for power. He believes in nothing any more, he said, & is convinced now that nothing will ever change himâ€”So, talking of something else for a moment, he suddenly burst out into a terrific peroration about Spengler; who has changed the world for himâ€”made infinitely more difference than anybodyâ€”so fixed & stable & independent is he.

Also we had a party: Roger a little oldâ€”to my mind he needs Nessa to fertilise & sweeten him. Some queer rancour often seems to exacerbate him. When his stomach heals his leg aches. And Plomer cameâ€”a little rigid, I fear; & too much of a gentleman; & little Blunden, the very image of a London house sparrow, that pecks & cheeps & is starved & dirty. And Julian, to me a very satisfactory young man at present; full of ardour, yet clear, precise; & genial tooâ€”with all his apostolic fervour & abstractedness a good fellow, warm, kindly; much more apt to see the good than the bad. For example he thought poor little grey mouse Jenkins very nice & very intelligent & sat screwed up on the floor at her feet. He had been consoling Topsy all the afternoon. For Topsy & Peter have separated. Yes they have separated for ever, owing to her flirtatious ways.
