As it is trueâ€”I write only for an hourâ€”then sink back feeling I cannot keep my brain on that spin any moreâ€”then typewrite, & am done by 12â€”I will here sum up my impressions before publishing a Room of Oneâ€™s own It is a little ominous that Morgan wont review it.* It makes me suspect that there is a shrill feminine tone in it which my intimate friends will dislike. I forecast, then, that I shall get no criticism, except of the evasive jocular kind, from Lytton, Roger & Morgan; that the press will be kind & talk of its charm, & sprightiness; also I shall be attacked for a feminist & hinted at for a sapphist; Sibyl will ask me to luncheon; I shall get a good many letters from young women. I am afraid it will not be taken seriously. Mrs Woolf is so accomplished a writer that all she says makes easy reading â€¦ this very feminine logic â€¦ a book to be put in the hands of girls. I doubt that I mind very much. The Moths; but I think it is to be waves, is trudging along; & I have that to refer to, if I am damped by the other. It is a trifle, I shall say; so it is, but I wrote it with ardour & conviction.

We dined last night with the Webbs, & I had Eddy & Dottie to tea. As for these mature dinner parties one has some friendly easy talk with one manâ€”Hugh Macmillanâ€”about the Buchans & his own career;â€”the Webbs are friendly but canâ€™t be influenced about Kenya: we sit in two lodging house rooms (the dining room had a brass bedstead behind a screen) eat hunks of red beef; & are offered whisky. It is the same enlightened, impersonal, perfectly aware of itself atmosphere. â€œMy little boy shall have his toyâ€â€”but dont let that go any further â€œâ€”thatâ€™s what my wife says about my being in the Cabinetâ€. No they have no illusions. And I compared them with L. & myself, & felt (I daresay for this reason) the pathos, the symbolical quality of the childless couple; standing for something, united.

As for â€˜seeingâ€™ Eddy & Dottie, there is not much to it; an occasional phrase one remembersâ€”Eddyâ€™s being in love with two people: Dottyâ€™s rational account of a bore whom she helps: Eddy wishes me to read his diary, but some, nameless, friend objects; but he agreed, before long: it is a gratification to him. And so 1Â½ hours passed. Dotty deplored Vitaâ€™s too early fame. Yet I suppose she loves her; is devoted; queer things lodge in peopleâ€™s souls;

I am very carefully & cautiously becoming a reader & a thinker again. Since I have been back I have read Virginia Water (a sweet white grape); God;â€”all founded, & teased & spun out upon one quite simple & usual psychological experience; but the manâ€™s no poet & cant make one see; all his sentences are like steel lines on an engraving; I am reading Racine, have bought La Fontaine, & so intend to make my sidelong approach to French literature, circling & broodingâ€”
