### Saturday 15 June

Home last night from Cassis; that is to say from Arles. The hottest holiday I have ever had. And in some ways different from others; partly that it was so hot; then that we were alone with Nessa & Duncan; then that I have become, almost, a landowner. A window owner, anyhow. Yes, I almost bought La Boudard (& am not sure of the spelling) & have a contract, to go there at the cost of Â£2.10 a month. And this means an infinite number of thingsâ€”perhaps a complete change; as buying a house so often does. Already this morning I feel an attachmentâ€”say a little islandâ€”floating some way off, but in my possession. And this island means heat, silence, complete aloofness from London; the sea; eating cakes in the new hotel at La Ciotat; driving off to Aix; sitting on the harbour dining; seeing the sardine boats come in; talk with people who have never heard of me & think me older, uglier than Nessa, & in every way inferior to her; that odd intimate, yet edgy, happy free yet somehow restrained intercourse with her & Duncan. It means also buying French books at Toulon & keeping them in my lovely cool room in the wood; Leonard in his shirtsleeves; an Eastern private life for us both; an Indian summer running in & out of the light of common day; a great deal of cheap wine & cigars; new alliances, with Currys, Cruthers, & other anomalous odditiesâ€”all this my engagement to make three windows at Boudard means to me.

I forget what the facts of our stay were. We were there for a week, coming the day before they expected us, oddly enough as we did last year. There was Duncan in his blue shirt; Angelica & Judith doing lessons on the terrace. Nessa drove Miss Campbell into the town & brought up the food every morning. I wrote a little article on Cowper, but lifting the words with difficulty in the heat, surrounded by black & white butterflies. And L. & I were very extravagant, for the first time in our lives, buying desks, tables, sideboards, crockery for Rodmell. This gave me pleasure; & set my dander up against Nessaâ€™s almost overpowering supremacy. My elder son is coming tomorrow; yes, & he is the most promising young man in Kingâ€™s; & has been speaking at the Apostles dinner. All I can oppose that with is, And I made Â£2,000 out of Orlando & can bring Leonard here & buy a house if I want. To which she replies (in the same inaudible way) I am a failure as a painter compared with you, & cant do more than pay for my models. And so we go on; over the depths of our childhood. Do you remember going down to the town to fetchâ€”which ancient memories Duncan cannot share. He was divinely charming; & praised Nessa too. I put in shred after shred of feeling so that one may compose the salad, & am now running out to get my books from Riley if I can.
