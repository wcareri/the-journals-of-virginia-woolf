### Thursday 22 August

And so I might fill up the half hour before dinner writing.

I thought, on my walk that I would begin at the beginning: I get up at half past eight & walk across the garden. Today it was misty & I had been dreaming of Edith Sitwell. I wash & go into breakfast which is laid on the check table cloth. With luck I may have an interesting letter; today there was none. And then bath & dress; & come out here & write or correct for three hours, broken at 11 by Leonard with Milk, & perhaps newspapers. At one luncheonâ€”rissoles today & chocolate custard. A brief reading & smoking after lunch; & at about two I change into thick shoes, take Pinkerâ€™s lead & go outâ€”up to Asheham hill this afternoon, where I sat a minute or two, & then home again, along the river. Tea at four, about; & then I come out here & write several letters, interrupted by the Post, with another invitation to lecture; & then I read one book of the Prelude. And soon the bell will ring, & we shall dine & then we shall have some music, & I shall smoke a cigar; & then we shall readâ€”La Fontaine I think tonight & the papersâ€”& so to bed. Here I will copy some lines I want to remember,

The matter that detains us now may seem,  
To many, neither dignified enough  
Nor arduous, yet will not be scorned by them,  
Who, looking inward, have observed the ties  
That bind the perishable hours of life  
Each to the other, & the curious props  
By which the world of memory & thought  
Exists & is sustained.

They are from the 7th book of the Prelude. A very good quotation I think.

But my skeleton day needs reviving with all sorts of different colours. Today it was grey & windy on the walk; yesterday generous & open; a yellow sun on the corn; & heat in the valley. Both days differ greatly; both are among the happiest of my lifeâ€”I mean among the happy undistinguished days, ripe & sweet & sound; the daily bread; for nothing strange or exalted has happened; only the day has gone rightly & harmoniously; a pattern of the best part of life which is in the country like this; & makes me wish to command more of themâ€”months of them.

Now my little tugging & distressing book & articles are off my mind my brain seems to fill & expand & grow physically light & peaceful. I begin to feel it filling quietly after all the wringing & squeezing it has had since we came here. And so the unconscious part now expands; & walking I notice the red corn, & the blue of the plain & an infinite number of things without naming them; because I am not thinking of any special thing. Now & again I feel my mind take shape, like a cloud with the sun on it, as some idea, plan, or image wells up, but they travel on, over the horizon, like clouds, & I wait peacefully for another to form, or nothingâ€”it matters not which.

One picture I sawâ€”Phil Burne Jones sitting in the square of St Markâ€™s, in evening dress, alone one August night in 1912â€”for we were on our honeymoon. He looked dissipated & lonely, like a pierrot who had grown old & rather peevish. He wore a light overcoat & sat, his foolish nervous white face looking aged & set unhappy & eager & disillusioned, alone at a little marble table, while everyone else paraded or chattered & the band playedâ€”he had no companionâ€”none of his smart ladiesâ€”nobody to chatter to, in his affected exaggerated voice; paying astonishing compliments, using dears & darlings & going into that once fashionable whinny of laughter which must I think have come down from Burne Jones himselfâ€”& Phil was a kind of dissipated degenerate, spending all the thousands that were paid for those wan women on staircases, on love affairs, on luxuries, on being a fashionable bachelor & fairy God father to the Trees & Taylors & other fashionable young ladiesâ€”a very timid conventional man at bottom, with a horrid taste in pictures, presumably, but a way with children. Lowell noticed that at St Ives. And I am still grateful for pictures that he drew for us. He belongs to the gallery of brilliant young men of 50, for he died a year or two ago.

The best part of my walk this afternoon was certainly on the top of the down leading to Juggs Corner.

Yes, yes, but that is days ago. I saw a woman in white sitting against soft snow banks of blue & white sky; & a child in blue: I saw all the downs glooming & brightening. But it is now
