### Sunday 30 June

I broke off; somebody I imagine interrupted. My melancholy has been broken, like a lake by oars, since I wrote. I have been so active. We have seen so many people. Last night we dined with Roger, tonight with Clive; Lytton came; Vita came; we had a party. I brought a dress in Shaftesbury Avenue. It was very hot, I think; & is now cold, indeed, for the first time for weeks, it is, or has been raining. I am writing idly, to solace my eyes after two hours of intense correctionâ€”that much corrected book, Women & Fiction. It shall go to the printer tomorrow I swear. And then I can bask entirely in the light of some fiction. But I have written myself out of that mood, & find it difficult to get back to it. This last half year I made over Â£1800; almost at the rate of Â£4000 a year; the salary almost of a Cabinet minister; & time was, two years ago, when I toiled to make Â£200. Now I am overpaid I think for my little articlesâ€”And I still think that the great pleasure of prosperity is to be able to go into a shop & buy a pocket knife. Well, after tomorrow I shall close down article writing, & give way to fiction for six or seven monthsâ€”till next March perhaps. And I here record my intention to see to the writing of this new book much more carefully; to strike out redundancies. Now that I have, I think, gained the free use of my pen, I must begin to curb it. Hitherto my freedom has had to be fought for.

Helen Anrep last night was distracted & worried, like a wet overblown Rose. Baba got out of her bed & went on the roof & fell asleep there. So Miss Cox proposes to put her down into a lower class for a year. And Roger had news that her Hampstead House was falling down; would need Â£500 spent on it. And how could she live on the income of Â£3,000 if she sold it to the Hampstead Hospital? The other day in Paris she thought she was going to have a child by Roger. â€œAnd Iâ€™ve failed utterly with the children I haveâ€”And I feel a hundred.â€ So she plained & crooned, sitting beside Roger, with her hand on the arm of his chair. Sometimes he put his hand on hers. They were affectionate & private; this is Rogerâ€™s private life. And it keeps him happy, while superficially he whirls from doctor to doctor; & springs & spins, & looks out places on the mapâ€”unable not to verify & track down any statement, however pointless. He told us how in some great French cave, there is a patch of green vegetation wherever the torchlight has fallen. And Mauron ran his hand along a ledge & thought it was moss. But it was bats dung. The bats fly up into the air.

Desmond is being very brilliant about the Byron letters & the Boswell papers. Think! There are 18 volumes of Boswellâ€™s diaries now to be published. With any luck I shall live to read them. I feel as if some dead person were said to be living after allâ€”an odd effect, this disinterment of a mass more of Boswell when one had thought all was known, all settled. And father never knew; & Sir Edmund Gosse is dead. These papers were in a cabinet in Ireland.

And now it is almost time for lunch; & after lunch I must again read my book; with a view, if possible, to shortening & condensing the last pages.
