### Saturday 28 December

Bernard Shaw said the other night at the Keynesâ€™â€”& the Keynesâ€™s have just wrecked my perfect fortnight of silence, have been over in their Rolls Royceâ€”& L. made them stay, & is a little inclined to think me absurd for not wishing itâ€”but then Clive is his bugbear at presentâ€”Bernard Shaw said to me, I have never written anything except poetry. A man has written a book showing how by altering a word or two a whole act of the Dâ octoâ rs Dilemma is in rhythm. In fact my rhythm is so strong that when I had to copy a page of Wells the other day in the midst of my own writing my pen couldnt do it. I was wanting to write my own rhythmâ€”yet I hadnâ€™t known till then that I had so strong a rhythm. Heartbreak House is the best of my plays. I wrote it after staying with you at the Webbs in Sussexâ€”perhaps you inspired it. And Lydia is making the Lady into Queen Victoria. No I never saw Stevensonâ€”Mrs Stevenson thought I had a cold.

You write Irish Mr Shaw. So does Mr Moore. Mooreâ€™s an odd manâ€”a very small talent cultivated with the utmost patience. We used to laugh at him in the old days. He was our butt. He was always telling us stories about himself & a ladyâ€”a grand ladyâ€”& she was always throwing something at his head & just missing itâ€”& he used to say â€œWait wait, thereâ€™s a good passage comingâ€. Nobody was better tempered. But he was our laughing stock. And one day Zola said to me Iâ€™ve discovered your great English novelist! Whoâ€™s that said I. His name is George Moore. And I burst out laughing not our little George Moore, with his stories about himself? But it was. A lesson, you see, not to be too quick in judging ones friends.

But all his stories are autobiographic, I said.

Yes, they are all about George Moore & the lady who throws something at his head.â€”is writing a life of Moore & has asked me to tell the story of his early days. I am collecting my works. I find that I wrote a million words about the theatre. I dont know what to do with it. My wife wants me to leave out. But I think it gives a curious picture of the time. I am ashamed to think that I could ever have written so badly. The collection is limited to 21 volumes. Theyre going to be sold in different bindings in Americaâ€”some in leather very expensiveâ€”others quite cheapâ€”hawked about all over America by peddlars. Im not a modest man but even I blushed at the stuff Iâ€™ve had to write for my publishers. Essential to every home & so on. I say out of twelve people, there will always be 3 women as clever as the men. What Iâ€™ve always told them is go for the governing bodiesâ€”dont mind about the vote. Insist upon representation. Now women are far more enthusiastic about business than men. They get things done. Men gossip in clubs. Oh but youve done more for us than anyone, Mr Shaw. My generation, & Francis Birrellâ€™s (he was sitting behind) we might be nice people, but weâ€™re different owing to you.

Happier said Francis.

Then Lydia came & broke in, with Mrs Shaw.
