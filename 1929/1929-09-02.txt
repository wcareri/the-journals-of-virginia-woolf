### Monday 2 September

& I am writing these words because Lyn (yes, she is Lyn) is reading in the garden, & I am talk-dried, & cant begin the Moths as I should, or patch up finally those old articles. A long day it was yesterdayâ€”rather exhaustingâ€”hard work talking to someone one hardly knows in the orchard. A very nice young woman, with that essential barenessâ€”I cant think of the wordâ€”that young women so often haveâ€”without illusions, about herself; an honesty bred of poverty. Keeping going on Â£200 a year in London which she earns. Pays her way week by week on articles; & her father has Â£600 as a presbyterian minister in Aberdeen, & will have Â£400 to retire on, & has 5 children. So that she will never have a penny of her own. All this breeds a kind of veracity & clear sightedness & austerity which I prefer, perhaps, to the lush undergrowth which surrounds Dotty. One gardener more or less, one persian pot more or less, what does it matterâ€”her life is crowded & otiose; but Lyn knows every object in her room, & has saved up & bought them by saving so that they are exact & polished. Well, but of her? Oh Iâ€™m so sick of talk, & analysis.

This book would form in me could I let my mind lie asleep, calm like a tideless sea; but all this time Iâ€™m breaking my mind up; destroying the growth underneath. Never mind, after tomorrow when I go to Vita, solitude begins* I shall ruminate for a month. Lyn has this austerity. She is direct & sensible; goes to the W.C. frankly; but is not sexually advanced I should say; has had no indulgences with young men or wine; has something cool headed & sensible about her, derived from her theological father, her Scots farmer birth no doubt. She has been trained in English literature & is, what young women so seldom are, or were, a trained critic. She gives her opinion precisely & methodically, rather as Janet Vaughan would do on a case. (Janet was here last week end, by the way.) This trained mind is new & rather strange. It seems to eliminate enthusiasm, perhaps too drastically. Its odd to find everything weighed & criticised. & words of sobriety & insight issuing from this innocent round pink face; these candid blue eyes. She will spend money on face powderâ€”went to buy a special brand & bought a cactus instead. Oh & she told a story about the dead man on the sands. She & Enid Welsford were motoring. One night they came to a bay & Enid wanted to walk to a long stretch of sand. So they went; & Lyn saw a coat & a pair of boots in the sand; & found it was a dead man. She stopped & went back, giving Enid the slip, not thinking that children might find it; absolutely horrified; her first sight of a dead person. This was made vivid to me. Enid came back. Did you see something? Yes I saw it. So they told the villagers. The man had been unhappily married & had seemed depressed & so killed himself, to be found that sad grey nightâ€”his boots sticking out of the sand, the face I suppose very ghastly.

I have just read a page or two of Samuel Butlerâ€™s notebooks to take the taste of Alice Meynellâ€™s life out of my mouth. One rather craves brilliance & cantankerousness. Yet I am interested; a little teased by the tight airless Meynell style; & then I think what they had that we had notâ€”some suavity & grace, certainly. They believed in things & we didnâ€™t; & she had 7 children & wrote about 5 paragraphs a day for society papers & so onâ€”all the time looking like a crucified saint; & was also very merry & witty perhapsâ€”anyhow absolutely steeped in various sorts of adventure & lifeâ€”went to America lecturing & made Â£15 a lecture, which she sent back to help Wilfrid. But it is not exactly this that I mean. When one reads a life one often compares oneâ€™s own life with it. And doing this I was aware of some sweetness & dignity in those lives compared with oursâ€”even with ours at this moment. Yet in fact their lives would be intolerableâ€”so insincere, so elaborate; so I thinkâ€”all this word paring & sweetness & charity. Viola cant help dropping in lump after lump of sugarâ€”only two sharp & therefore memorable things surviveâ€”her mother failed as a friend. She never gave enough. Old Coventry Patmore, whom she thought the equal of Shâ akespeare, complained that he had lost the primacy among her friends & dropped out; whereupon she went alone into the drawing room, for she hated to express her feelings, & also hated long accounts of illness & death in biographies, turning her face away from her son in her last illness, & letting him only kiss her hand. Secondly there was the oddity of her admiration for Chesterton. Had I been a man & very big I could have been Chesterton. That is, her views were all peculiar & angular, & stuck to pedantically. She had a line of her own. But it would be a wonderful relief if Viola would give up being pointed & precise & tell us something casual & familiarâ€”only she cant: her mind in stays. Katherine Mansfield described a visit to the house in Sussexâ€”All the Ms. in barns & cottages; & the daughters singing long monotonous ballads, & then, by way of contrast & to surprise a scallywag I daresay with their liveliness breaking into music hall songs taught them by their brothers in law. Katherine described them like so many Bâ urne Jâ ones mermaids with long lush hair, plucking at mediaeval instruments & intoning those verses. Mrs M. sat by. And I saw her in 1910 (?) at Mrs Rossâ€™s, & heard her say that saying about the climate & then there she was ecstatic in an omnibus.â€”I recorded my regret that one ever saw poetesses in the flesh. For she was a poetess tooâ€”it strikes me that one or two little poems will survive all that my father ever wrote. But its oddâ€”this comparing that goes on as one reads a lifeâ€”I kept thinking how little good could be said of me.
