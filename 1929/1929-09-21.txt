### Saturday 21 September

Angelica goes to school for the first time today I think; & I daresay Nessa is crying to herselfâ€”one of the emotions I shall never knowâ€”a child, oneâ€™s last childâ€”going to school, & so ending the 21 years of Nessaâ€™s childrenâ€”a great stretch of life; how much fuller than I can guessâ€”imagine all the private scenes, the quarrels, the happinesses, the moments of excitement & change, as they grew up. And now, rather sublimely she ends her childhood years in a studio alone, going back, perhaps rather sadly to the life she would have liked best of all once, to be a painter on her own. So we have made out our lives, she & I, propelled into them by some queer force; for me, I always think of those curious long autumn walks with which we ended a summer holiday, talking of what we were going to doâ€”â€˜autumn plansâ€™ we called them. They always had reference to painting & writing & how to arrange social life & domestic life better. Often we thought about changing a room, so as to have somewhere to see our own friends. They were always connected with autumn, leaves falling, the country getting pale & wintry, our minds excited at the prospect of lights & streets & a new season of activity beginningâ€”October the dawn of the year. But I am rambling off like an old woman into the past, when as I sat down, waiting for tea, I said to myself I have so many things to write in my diary.

Another of those curious plums, things falling unexpectedly in our way, has just happened. Annie the large eyed sad young woman has been to ask us to buy her a cottage, & let her do for us always, in fact be our servant here. She & her baby, aged two, have been turned out at a fortnights notice to make room for two spinster dog breeders. Humanity says we ought to buy her her cottage, & take no rentâ€”let her work it off. Another Â£350, & repairsâ€”more articles. She would make an ideal servant, I believe; she would be a great standby; one could come here as long as one likedâ€”& poor dear Nelly could be left in London,â€”for she gave notice again this morning, to Leonard this time, about his coal scuttle. It seems we are settling & rooting almost daily. I should have to dismiss poor spindly Bartholomew. It needs some thinkingâ€”meanwhile Annie is up against this terrific high black prison wall of povertyâ€”has to manage with a child on 15/- a week.

These reflections, which branch off down so many paths make me linger, over the two other recordsâ€”Peter, & my future, which I thought I was going to write; but it is tea time, & then I want to wander off up the downs or along the river, straightening my ideas.

Please God nobody comes to tea. Yet Lytton & Antony Blunt & Peter are all at Charleston. Please God I say these delightful & divine people dont come & make me concentrate again all in my face & brain. I want to swim about in the dark green depths. By the way last night in the Evening Standard James Laver called me a great writer â€œnobody need seek to qualify the greatness of Miss Virginia Woolfâ€â€”hah! I hope Arnold Bennett sees that.
