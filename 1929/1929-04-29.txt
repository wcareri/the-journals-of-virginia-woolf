### Monday 29 April

And it is pouring. Oh this cold spring! Dry as a bone, though until today, but with never a blue sky. So that my red coat, which is like haws in winter, suits it. I heard the nightingale at Vitaâ€™s a week or two agoâ€”the one warm night. And we were cold at Rodmell last week, when we went down to see Philcox, who will build two rooms for Â£320, & take only two months. It was cold; but how silent, how safe from voices & talk! How I resented our coming back; & quickly changed into the social sphere of my soul; & went to lunch with Sibyl; & there had, for my pains, precisely six minutes of tolerable talk with Max Beerbohm. But dear me, how little talk with great men now disturbs me. Are we all chilling & freezing, & do we look into each others old faces as into the craters of the moon? (These I saw silver white & like the spots that are made by water dropping into plaster of paris through Vitaâ€™s telescope the other day.) I begin to think that youth is the only tolerable thing to look at; & am taking Judy to the Coliseum on Wednesday.

I forgot to say that the pump has begun again & is grinding away at this moment. But I say I shall get used to itâ€”certainly I shall.

This morning I began to revise Phases of Fiction, & with that done, I can see my way clear to a complete imaginative book.

Meanwhile, I am eddying quicker & quicker into the stream, into London: tomorrow Christabel; then Mauronâ€™s lecture & Mary & the Keynesâ€™ & the Eliots.

Poor Tomâ€”a true poet, I think; what they will call in a hundred years a man of genius: & this is his life. I stand for half an hour listening while he says that Vivien cant walk. Her legs have gone. But whats the matter? No one knows. And so she lies in bedâ€”cant put a shoe on. And they have difficulties, humiliations, with servants. And after endless quibbling about visitingâ€”which he cant do these 8 weeks, owing to moving house & 15 first cousins come to England, suddenly he appears overcome, moved, tragic, unhappy, broken down, because I offer to come to tea on Thursday. Oh but we dont dare ask our friends, he said. We have been deserted. Nobody has been to see us for weeks. Would you really comeâ€”all this way? to see us? Yes I said. But what a vision of misery, imagined, but real too. Vivien with her foot on a stool, in bed all day; Tom hurrying back lest she abuse him: this is our man of genius.â€”This is what I gathered yesterday morning on the telephone.
