### Monday 6 June

Last night, Sunday, dining at Cliveâ€™s. Just back from Wiltshire. Brown. Good tempered. Nessa heating dinner. C. cross with Lottieâ€”too many dishesâ€”too much fussâ€”does the napkins into shapesâ€”chatter, gossip; ballet; attack on Bolithoâ€™s Price Consort; Quentin thinks Emperor Napoleon attractive; Clive swears heâ€™s wrong; story of MerimÃ©e in love with the Empress Mother; so to Tommy & Raymond. Some acrimony. Duncan says â€œRaymond needs an arboreous bushâ€. Nessa says T. wd. appreciate that; Raymond wouldnâ€™t; I say T.â€™s a screeching gull, & ought to be happy in a lovely young wife; Nessa laughs; they say thats the agonyâ€”he isnâ€™t happy. What worse torture? says Clive. One would agree to try living with her in Lambs Conduit St. & then the memory of happier days (always thus lyrical about lovers). And heâ€™s falling flat says Nessa: Angus no longer loves him, nor Barbara. Raymond can make a story out of life, T. cant, I say, for all his sitting in public houses. Oh but he can, says Nessa. Raymond only sits in drawing rooms, says D. testy. (He has been testy about Cassis gossip). So to bed: a man says I lunched with Mrs â€”â€” & she has a heavenly bull pup 7 weeks old
