### Monday 23 May

Here is a little scene that I will write, bored as I am with refurbishing Dickens.

Yesterday we were driving home. As we came to Mortlake Bridge I saw some heads bobbing in the river. I thought they were boys bathing; I thought it odd; why bathe on Sunday under a bridge! And then I saw a boat flopping on its side; & then a crowd; & then putting two & two together realised that this silent bobbing scene meant that here was an accident. We stopped & got out & watched three or four people swimming very slowly in full dress the few yards to shore. Then a sound of snoring sobbing was heard. Nobody moved. Nobody was excited active or amused. One red faced dishevelled woman was lying on her back. A man was pulling & pushing her. At last they touched shore; & a bright eyed elderly man scrambled up the steep bank, ran quickly, dripping in black trousers plastered to his legs, to the parapet, where he had left a hat & an overcoat. It was a sordid, silent spectacleâ€”this heroic rescue. Middle class people in full Sunday dress immersed in cold water. I thought of a picture of a miracle; people fully dressed floating: there was a touch of the grotesque; none of terror or sublimity. The boat lay like a log boat, on its side.

So home: & Hilda is willing; & therefore, late last night John comes & renews his application. The mixture of emotionalism & grasping is so odd: as hard as nails, & then quivering.
