And then we heard that Lytton was very ill againâ€”they had thought him dying on Sunday. â€œGive him morphiaâ€”it makes no differenceâ€ the Dr said. So down we went to Ham Spray on Thursday. So hot, so fresh. The larks singing over the petrol pumps I remember on the Great West Road as we stopped to fill up. They were strained, silent, held in a lock. Then tearsâ€”Pippa sobbing on my shoulder at the Bear after lunchâ€”hopeless almostâ€”he is so illâ€”how can he get better? Then back to Ham Sprayâ€”how lovely, with its flat lawn, & the trees grouped & the down rising & the path climbing the down: this I noted, with envy thinking of my dogs barking, my downs ruined, as we sat at tea. I long sometimes for this sealed up, silent, remote country: long for its little villages; its muddy roads, its distance from Brighton & Peacehavenâ€”the roads that go on to Bath, to Oxford, driving through solid England. And so home again, leaving them in the frail lovely house, with hospital nurses popping in & out, all orderly arranged as after long weeks of illness: a light in Lyttonâ€™s room, the shadow of a screen. He said he liked our coming. Odd to come thus, after all these years. Again today Carrington writes he is slightly better.
