### Tuesday 10 May

Only the most hardened scribbler could attempt to write in the Orient Expressâ€”for the letters are swept out of my handâ€”heads & tails. Here we are, 10.30, in Jugo Slavia, a tamer more subjugated country far than Greece, the last of which we saw last nightâ€”crossing a terrific stone gorge on a crazy bridge & looking down till I quivered from our window, sitting down to dinner with Venus colliding with the moon, & a shepherds hut, & two men in long coats lit up by the electric lights of our restaurant car. Curious contrasts! Our sufficiency & civilisation drawing all compact through want, poverty, desolation, shepherds, sheep, torrents, lonely rivers winding through rocks. We dined, on the usual smoke grey china. Another bride & groom on board. Gathered in the salon at the station were all their friends come with boxes of chocolate. She said in English â€œLooking through my things I found this beltâ€ & gave it to the young man with the choc. box. A few sentencesâ€”specially intimateâ€”archâ€”coquettish?â€”in English; then a babble of Greek again. A language one doesnâ€™t understand is always unaccented, sibyllant, soft, wavy, unidentifiable with words. Last night was bad. Very hot. Then interruptions. At Salonika (1.30) they came in to ask about money. We had been advised to hide all except 600 drachmasâ€”where? In the electric light bell he said. An impossible ideaâ€”so we disposed them all overâ€”in the pockets of Baedeker, in an envelope. In Yugo Slavia the same question. So on, stopping & starting all night. We woke, & washed, looking at mountains. But the time had changed back & we had to wait 2 hours for coffee. Now for Rousseau.
