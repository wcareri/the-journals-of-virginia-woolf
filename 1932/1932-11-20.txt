### Thursday 20 November

I am taking a morning off, having done the child sceneâ€”the man exposing himselfâ€”in the Pargiters: to polish my LS. (done) & then to write letters. Theres Ottâ€™s memoirâ€”a queer thing that Ott shd. come, after all these years, old shabby tender to my sofa; & I liked her; its her integrity thats sloppy; thats what we all slipped on. Cant tell the truth about loveâ€”but then thats so interesting, & not discreditable, considering her upbringingâ€”Welbeck, the young men servants. So she lent me her memoirs, full as they are of love letters, & copulation. I must now write to herâ€”& to Margaret Ll.D. & so on. Janet Case comes to tea today, & then theres Derick Leon & Julia to dinnerâ€” A long day for me, who must must must be quiet & spacious this autumn, to finish the Pâ argiterâ s. How important I feel it!â€”well, this is the merest note .. And weâ€™ve bought a Lanchester: to be delivered on Dec. 10th. Grey & green. I dont think weâ€™ve ever been so happy, what with one thing & another. And so intimate, & so completely entire, I mean L. & I. If it could only last like this another 50 yearsâ€”life like this is wholly satisfactory, to me anyhow. So to my letters.
