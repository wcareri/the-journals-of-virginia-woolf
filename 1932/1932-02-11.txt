### Thursday 11 February

My mind is set running upon A Knock on the Door (whats its name?) owing largely to reading â€˜Wells on Womanâ€™â€”how she must be ancillary & decorative in the world of the future, because she has been tried, in 10 years, & has not proved anything. So in this mood I record Maryâ€™s telling me last night how she loved cigars; but Jack refuses to let her smoke themâ€”against his idea of what his wife should doâ€”silly affectationâ€”or to let her dress in a dress cut low at the back. Cant go out with you in that frock. Go & put on another. Its indecentâ€”yet will praise Diana for wearing the same. â€œI threw everything out of the window onceâ€ she said. â€œHe treats usâ€”Barbara & meâ€”as if we were tame leopardsâ€”pets belonging to himâ€. As indeed they do, since neither has a penny except of Jackâ€™s earning & giving. She burst into tears, about Lytton: her best, her most intimate friendâ€”â€œAnd now I live merely with barbarians. I have nobody to talk to. Lytton came every week. He told me about all his boys. He sat sobbing bitterly, when Roger was cruel to him. Oh he loved himâ€”just loved himâ€”Thats what I couldnâ€™t understand, & you could, I said. And he was so brilliant, so alive, last winter. I went to him about a fortnight before he was ill. I was in an ecstasy. I said Youâ€™re wonderful, wonderfulâ€”He was so vigorous, giving a party to five young men. We stood in the hall. There was a letter from one of them refusing to come. And he kissed me. He was so sweet. He would come in. There was the coat he wore. He would talk of everything; tell me everything. And all the time there was this growth in him; & here Virginia & Mary sit talking of him & heâ€™s dead. I cant believe itâ€
