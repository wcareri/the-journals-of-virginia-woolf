What ~~should be~~ is the right attitude towards criticism? What ought I to feel & say & do when Miss B. devotes an article in Scrutiny to attacking me? She is young, Cambridge, ardent. And she says Iâ€™m a very bad writer. Now I think the thing to do is to note the pith of what is saidâ€”that I dont thinkâ€”then to use the little kick of energy which opposition supplies to be more vigorously oneself. It is perhaps true that my reputation will now decline. I shall be laughed at & pointed at. What should be my attitudeâ€”clearly Arnold Bennett & Wells took the criticism of their youngsters in the wrong way. The right way is not to resent; not to .. be long suffering & Christian & submissive either. Of course, with my odd mixture of extreme rashness & modesty (to analyse roughly) I very soon recover from praise & blame. But I want to find out an attitude. The most important thing is not to think very much about oneself. To investigate candidly the charge; but not fussily, not very anxiously. On no account to retaliate by going to the other extremeâ€”thinking too much. And now that thorn is outâ€”perhaps too easily but then of course John interrupted.
