### Saturday 17 December

I have precisely 4 minutes before luncheon in which to record Rebecca West at dinnerâ€”oh yes a very clever woman, rather rubbed about the thorax: with a great supply of worldly talk: & much go & humour; a silky careening society voice; flowers from her afterwards to apologise for staying till 1.30.

And Loganâ€”lord, what a bore: a dogmatic cultivated American bore; no truth in him; but an uneasy worm squirming for compliments. This I could see through his shallow water; & was â€˜very severeâ€™ L. says (L. is always a judge of my severity: & I of his) but I cant keep my temper when people thrust. Its not playing the game. And thenâ€”oh ever so many people; & a wind up with L.â€™s family & then the Frys to dinner: & weâ€™re cheated of the car for Christmas, God damn their souls: all this is very helter skelter: & dinner with Hope last night: her stuffed black dachshund sausage stretched along my knee; & so to Rodmell on Tuesday. Iâ€™ve almost written out my first furyâ€”234 typewritten pages since Oct 10thâ€”& shall put my brain to rest for a few days at Monks House. But the fun of the book is to come, with Magdalena & Elvira.
