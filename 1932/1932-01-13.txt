Oh but this is, as I always say, making an apology myself to myself, not the first day of the year. It is the thirteenth, & I am in one of those lassitudes & ebbs of life when I cannot heave another word on to the wall. My word, what a heaving The Waves was, that I still feel the strain! We came back from Rodmell last Sunday afternoonâ€”a wet evening, & comfortable to be back, here high up in the air, beyond barking dogs. â€œI shall go bankrupt if those dogs bark any moreâ€ I said to Anny with some vehemence, & this, implying her ruin, made her speak to Elsie, & the dogs fell silent. Miss Belsher is reported â€˜very illâ€™. L. is to see father Belsher this afternoon, & I am to see Mrs Thring â€˜on a private & confidential matterâ€™ which I guess to be the printing of a little book of poems by herself. Timeâ€”3.30 to be exactâ€”will prove. Then Miss Cashin is ill too; the press is supported on 2 legs, one the stout leg of good-natured Walton. John labours too, more nervously, & feels jaded, & wants a week off, & wants also, to be our manager, not partner, but to stay in that capacity. So, perhaps, & perchanceâ€”for I make no rash boastsâ€”the dear old Press to which I owe so much labourâ€”witness the pile of MSS before meâ€”& funâ€”oh yes, a great deal of variety & oddity, life on tap down here whenever it flags upstairsâ€”may now settle down for life. For our lives. How long will they be? Can we count on another 20 years? I shall be fifty on 25th, Monday week that is; & sometimes feel that I have lived 250 years already, & sometimes that I am still the youngest person in the omnibus. (Nessa said that she still always thinks this, as she sits down.) And I want to write another 4 novels: Waves, I mean; & the Tap on the Door; & to go through English literature, like a string through cheese, or rather like some industrious insect, eating its way from book to book, from Chaucer to Lawrence. This is a programme, considering my slowness, & how I get slower, thicker, more intolerant of the fling & the rash, to last out my 20 years, if I have them. Lytton goes on, now better, now not so well. And one has taken him back after those sepulchral days when he seemed vanished as part of life. Leonard said â€œWe must make up our minds that we shall never see Lytton againâ€;â€”or something like that, which made us feel bereft; the end of a section; & now I say it is not the end.

And Vita supports the weight of the Nicolsons on her shoulders, working, working working so that she cant sleep oâ€™nights, Ethel says Hilda says. But why? People should ride life like a horse. This money accumulating, keeping sons at Eton & Long Barn & Sissâ inghursâ t in full swing seems to me a little servile: save that she loves generosity & is industrious, & has that queer vein in her of thinking the slogging money making ant like worker, the independent, the professional, romantic. And so she scribbles reviews, broadcastsâ€”pray heaven I may never fall into the money-trap!
