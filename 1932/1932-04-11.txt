### Monday 11 April

The eddy of travelâ€”wisps & strawsâ€”is already whirling round. I have a list of things to buy on my table. We start at 10 on Friday; shall be sailing down the Dalmatian coast this time next week. Embedded as I am in Tavistock Sqre I cant make much play with this. Also it is fiendishly cold, wet, blowing, like last year in France. I like this adventure of Greece all the same; & the fact that we are sociably going with Roger & Margery; & thatâ€”intimacyâ€”will be part of our journey. The result of Lyttonâ€™s deathâ€”this desire to be with friends. I am muddled headed. This perpetual criticism tires my brain. Iâ€™ve almost done de Quincey though, & am well on with the book.

As for external factsâ€”it seems likely that our John will not stay. That is he wishes to work half time in order to write. Elizabeth Williamson is a possibilityâ€”rain rainâ€”it drums on my skylight. L. is doing Press accounts & it looks as if we should net Â£2000.

Hail now; & camel coloured sky. I am waiting for lunch. Dear me, I ought to read some hideously obscure poems. Tomorrow we go to Monks House to take Pinka. This is a little girls writingâ€”like a childs letter. Iâ€™ve seen the Nicolsons, & Ethel, & Kingsley Martin. Harold up to be looked at for that job. And James & Alix. Lytton left masses of poems & unfinished playsâ€”not much good, James says. And box upon box of letters. Ours still lost. What to do? said James. He said nasty things about everyone. How can they be published? Could one extract a philosophy? He had meant to write one more book for money on Washington & then burn his boats: declare himself & live abroad. Declare what? Everything. His hatred &c. Sex: love: But I doubt it. There was Ham Spray.
