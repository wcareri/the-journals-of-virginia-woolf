### Sunday 31 January

Having just finished, as I say, the final version as I call it, of my Letter to a young poet, I can take a moments liberty. From the cynical tone of this sentence I see that my finality is not secure. Writing becomes harder & harder. Things I dashed off I now compress & re-state. And for purposes which I need not go into here, I want to use these pages for dialogue for a time. Let me race down the subdued & dulled interview with my mother in law. Oh the heat in that rose pink bed sitting room, with 3 fierce lights on, the tables crowded with flowers; & with cakes, a fire blazing. Mrs W. sitting upright with her feet on a stool on a high straight backed chair: more pink silk cushions behind her: pearl necklaces swinging. I came in late; she was talking aboutâ€”I forget: had been talking about the girl whom Cecil might have loved: the daughter of a solicitor at Colchester: Oh yes: she had had influenza & gone to a house kept up by funds left by Mr Andrews. And she was reluctant at firstâ€”a home you know. But when she got there what was her amazement? All gentlewomen: flowers everywhere; a cupboard with tonics & sweets to take after them; & Georgian silver on the dinner table; & a garden; & a saloon car to take them out; & grounds; & hot milk at eleven, or chocolate; & the wireless, & a page boy coming for orders; & gardeners. Everything you could wish & not a penny to pay for it! Thats so rareâ€”charity that is really thoughtful; charity for educated women with nice feelings who have fallen on bad times. Well Virginiaâ€”& whats your news? Oh & thereâ€™s Captain Steel: every Christmas he has a card from the Duke of Gloucester: & he now sells Hoovers for Â£2.10 a week. But what can one do, in these days? One must do what one can. And what is your news, Virginia? Exodus? Dont you know Exodus? I sometimes scold myself that I havenâ€™t read the Bible lately. Deuteronomy? Oh yesâ€”thats about the building of the Temple. I dont say its all true; but what stories to tell children! I shall never forget telling Bella. Of course a first child is always a wonder child. She used to have her dinner with me when she was 2. And she said what a pity it was summer when Eve stole the apple. If it had been winter, there wouldnâ€™t have been an apple. And she said too: I know where gold comes fromâ€”thatâ€™s in the ground: but where do picture frames come from? We had large gilt picture frames with family portraits in the dining room. (V.) Well why dont you write about your children? Oh no: I couldnâ€™t say all I think about them. And youâ€™re going so soon? But you havenâ€™t hardly come. And youâ€™ll dine with me next week? She came down to the hall, & was I think going into the lounge to talk to some flushed women playing cards.
