### Saturday 20 August

A curious day in London yesterday. I said to myself standing at L.â€™s window, â€˜Look at the present moment because its not been so hot for 21 years.â€™ There was a hot wind, as if one passed over a kitchen, going from the studio to the Press. Outside girls & young men lying in white on the Square grass. So hot we couldnâ€™t sit in the dining room. L. fetched & carried & hardly let me walk upstairs carrying my own body. Coming back we had the car shut & the windscreen openâ€”thus sat in a hot rough gale, which, as we came to the lanes & woods became deliciously cold & green. The coolest place is the front seat of a car going at 40 or 50 miles with the windscreen open. Today, at 12.30 a wind rose: clouds descended; now at 3.45 its almost a normal warm summer day. For 10 days this heat has lasted. After my faint my head soon throbs: or so I think. I think, a little, of dying suddenly. & reflect well then go about eating & drinking & laughing & feeding the fish. Oddâ€”the silliness one attributes to deathâ€”the desire one has to belittle it, & be found as Montaigne said, laughing with girls & good fellows. And L. is staking out the dewpond; & I am going in to be photographed.
