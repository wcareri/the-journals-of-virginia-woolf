### Friday 18 March

Last night at William Plomerâ€™s: talk, talk talk. Let me try to remember: on cooking: breadmaking; peaches rotten; Glaspells: going over the house; Tonyâ€™s studio; Tony bald, innocent, blue eyed & slow stumbling; William compact & robust. An eye for furniture. Tonyâ€™s tables, beds & sofas, in the Empire style. Gas fire. Talk of The Fountain. Oh & Tonyâ€™s fathers first wife died of apoplexy in Constantinople, through running to catch the boat on a hot day, a very fat woman. Mary Butts. â€œI cannot say anything of my sisterâ€”She is a bad womanâ€”pretentiousâ€”I can see no merit in her booksâ€”pretentious. She corrupts young men. They are always committing suicide. She now has married Gabriel Atkinsâ€”without any character. They were given 25 decanters for their wedding.â€ Tony is ashamed of Mary, who thus defiles the Butts blood. In came Louise Morgan, the interviewer, nerve drawn, lined, crimson, agile; & Mrs Paul Robeson, negroid, vivacious, supple, talking like a woman on the stage: chiefly to L. about negroes. And Janin, who admires my books, & has a friend who wants to translate; a thin skinned Frog all gesture & wrinkle; a coffee merchant ex diplomat; despises society; stories of Colefax, French Embassy. The Duke of Vendomeâ€”â€œQue câ€™est mÃ©lÃ©e, mon monde!â€ Talk, talk, talk. And cold; & a glass of green water; & so home to bed. William rather pompous, ceremonious, & considerate.

Tea with Nessa, Julian & Mrs Ramsey: the dissertation: Nessa wishes him to give it up. Robustly satisfied with him whatever he does. How dull this is to meâ€”who like faults. Talk of Carrington: how long shall we talk of Carrington? Dispute as to how she got her gun. Maryâ€™s story of the 3 rabbits on the lawn.
