London

Yes. I will allow myself a new nib. Odd how coming back here upsets my writing mood. Odder still how possessed I am with the feeling that now, aged 50, Iâ€™m just poised to shoot forth quite free straight & undeflected my bolts whatever they are. Therefore all this flitter flutter of weekly newspapers interests me not at all. These are the soulâ€™s changes. I dont believe in ageing. I believe in forever altering oneâ€™s aspect to the sun. Hence my optimism. And to alter now, cleanly & sanely, I want to shuffle off this loose living randomness: people; reviews; fame; all the glittering scales; & be withdrawn; & concentrated. So I shant run about, just yet, buying clothes, seeing people. We are off to Leicester tomorrow, to the Labour party conference. Then back to the fever of publishing. My C.R. doesnt cause me a single tremor. Nor Holtbyâ€™s book. Iâ€™m interested in watching what goes on for the moment without wishing to take partâ€”a good frame of mind, when oneâ€™s conscious of power. Then I am backed now by the downs: the country: how happy L. & I are at Rodmell: what a free life that isâ€”sweeping 30 or 40 miles; coming in when & how we like; sleeping in the empty house; dealing triumphantly with interruptions; & diving daily into that divine lovelinessâ€”always some walk: & the gulls on the purple plough; or going over to Tarring Nevilleâ€”these are the flights I most love nowâ€”in the wide, the indifferent air. No being jerked, teased, tugged. And people come easily, flowering into intimacy in my room. But this is the past, or future.

I am also reading DHL. with the usual sense of frustration. Not that he & I have too much in commonâ€”the same pressure to be ourselves: so that I dont escape when I read him; am surfeited; what I want is to be made free of another world. This Proust does. To me Lawrence is airless, confined: I dont want this, I go on saying. And the repetition of one idea. I dont want that either. I dont want â€˜a philosophyâ€™ in the least; I dont believe in other peopleâ€™s reading of riddles. What I enjoy (in the Letters) is the sudden visualisation: the great ghost springing over the wave (of the spray in Cornwall) but I get no satisfaction from his explanations of what he sees. And then its harrowing: this panting effort after something; & â€˜I have Â£6.10 leftâ€™ & then Government hoofing him out, like a toad; & banning his book; the brutality of civilised society to this panting agonised man: & how futile it was. All this makes a sort of gasping in his letters. And none of it seems essential. So he pants & jerks. Then too I dont like strumming with two fingersâ€”& the arrogance. After all English has one million words: why confine yourself to 6? & praise yourself for so doing. But its the preaching that rasps me. Like a person delivering judgment when only half the facts are there; & clinging to the rails & beating the cushion. Come out & see whats up hereâ€”I want to say. I mean its so barren; so easy; giving advice on a system. The moral is, if you want to help, never systematiseâ€”not till youâ€™re 70: & have been supple & sympathetic & creative & tried out all your nerves & scopes. He died though at 45. And why does Aldous say he was an â€˜artistâ€™? Art is being rid of all preaching: things in themselves: the sentence in itself beautiful: multitudinous seas; daffodils that come before the swallow dares: whereas Lâ  would only say what proved something. I havent read him of course. But in the Letters he cant listen beyond a point; must give advice; get you in to the system too. Hence his attraction for those who want to be fitted; which I dont: indeed I think it a blasphemy this fitting of Carswells into a Lawrence system. So much more reverent to leave them alone: nothing else to reverence except the Carswellism of Carswell. Hence his minds schoolboy tweaking & smacking of anyone offered to him: Lytton, Bertie,â€”Squireâ€”all are suburban, unclean. His ruler coming down & measuring them. Why all this criticism of other people? Why not some system that includes the good? What a discovery that would beâ€”a system that did not shut out.
