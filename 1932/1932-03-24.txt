### Thursday 24 March

I am not sure of the precise day, save that it is Thursday & tomorrow is Good Friday & therefore we are at Rodmell on the loveliest spring day: soft: a blue veil in the air torn by birds voices. I am glad to be alive & sorry for the dead: cant think why Carrington killed herself & put an end to all this. True, they are building the vast elephant grey sheds at Asheham, but I intend to see them as Greek temples; & Percy says they are building 60 cottagesâ€”but we wait to see if this is so. And the country is lovelier & lovelier; more friendly, charming, brilliant, still with great empty spaces, where I want to walk, alone, & come to terms with my own head. Another book? What? Merciful to be free, entirely to think this out; neednâ€™t write a line I dont want to, or squander a moment on repetition. Two books on Virginia Woolf have just appearedâ€”in France & Germany. This is a danger signal. I must not settle into a figure.

Perhaps we are becoming more sociable. Mrs Hawkesford wants to bring her daughter to tea. I think we shall go to Greece with Roger & Margery. Andâ€”well, we go to tea with M. Baring on Monday.

Iâ€™m drowsing in this heat & quiet. Cant correct any more C.R. articles; nor write letters; yet it isnâ€™t lunch time yet. And thereâ€™s the paper to read. Odd that Lytton didnâ€™t write more. Which life should one leadâ€”the life one likes. I like writing. I like change. I like to toss my mind up & watch to see where itâ€™ll fall. Nessa off to Cassis. Clive coming back. Then the London Season: then here again. A happy life. But encompassed by solitudeâ€”human life I mean. Miss Bowen, stammering, shy, conventional, to tea.
