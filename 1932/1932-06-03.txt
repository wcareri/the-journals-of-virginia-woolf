### Friday 3 June

I dont like old ladies who guzzle. My comment upon Ethel Smyth last nightâ€”no doubt a harsh one. But she champed & chopped; & squabbled over her duck; & then was over eaten & had to go home.

My comment upon the Shaws:

he said â€œI am not sufficiently fond of myself to wish for immortality. I should like to be different. I should like to be a performer in music, & a mathematician. So I dont keep a diary. I destroy all my letters. So did. He had had letters from every great man. He took them out in the garden & burnt them. But I couldnt burn Ellen Terryâ€™s. They were works of art. It would have been like burning a page of the Luttrell psalter. The handwriting was a work of art. She scribbâ [l]â ed themâ€”never thought of a phrase. But I admit that when our correspondence was published I thoughtâ€”I admitâ€”I shall be the hero: not a bit of it: I have to admit that Ellen was the superior. She comes out far the better of the two. Frank Harrisâ€”his life of me was a life of himself. Theres no truth in it about me. No life of me has a word of truth in it. They say my father was persecuted, & that I was persecuted, as a boyâ€”sent to a Wesleyan School. Desmond MacCarthy says heâ€™s going to write my lifeâ€”well, he may say so. He comes & talksâ€”I cant tell the truth yet, about myself. The Webbs looked lonely somehow going off to Russia. Heâ€™s not growing oldâ€”no, I dont find that. Iâ€™ve always quarrelled with the Webbs. You see Webb has a gigantic faculty for absorbing information. He could have gone to Oxfordâ€”found some flaw in the statutesâ€”proved it to the examiners. But didnâ€™t go: only wanted to be in the right. And so, when I first knew him, I had to overcome an immense amount of useless knowledge. He had to forget things he had learnt. I always tell a story to illustrate this. When I was a boy I asked my father â€œWhat is a Unitarianâ€ And he thought for a time & then he said, â€œUnitarians believe that after Christ was crucified he got down off the Cross & ran away on the other side of the hill.â€ Years later, when I was 30 or so, I was staying with the Trevelyans at Wellcomb; & the talk got upon Unitarians, & it flashed upon me, this cannot be the true storyâ€”but Iâ€™d always seen Christ running down the hill all those years. Webb would be much more effective if heâ€™d one drop of the artist. But he has, not one. Beatrice is in despair about it. Cant make a good speech therefore. People think my style as speaker is spontaneous, colloquial. Its the most artificial ever known. Iâ€™ve taken long railway journeys & spent them saying the letters of the alphabet aloud so as to make my vowels strike out. Then they forget Iâ€™m an Irishmanâ€”I think quicker than the English. No I dont mug things upâ€”when I write history I dont read it. I imagine the sort of things people would have done & then I say they did them & then I find out factsâ€”one always canâ€”that prove it. The great pleasure of the Broadcasting to me is that I can sit at home & conduct The Meistersinger myself. I sit with the book of the score & conduct & Iâ€™m furious when they dont follow me. That way one finds how often the singers make howlersâ€”come in a bar early or late. Beechamâ€”(here he sang a piece of the Magic Flute) turned thatâ€”which is solemn, slow, processionlyâ€”into a hornpipe. I leapt in my seat (he leapt up his knees & clasped them in agonyâ€” he is never still a momentâ€”he clenches his fistsâ€”he flings himself this way & that; he sprang up to go, as if he were 22, not 74 as L. remarked. What life, what vitality! What immense nervous spring! That perhaps is his genius. Immense vivacityâ€”& why I dont read him for pleasure. His face is bright red; his nose lumpy: his eyes sea green like a sailors or a cockatoos. He doesnt much notice whoâ€™s there. Told stories about the fortunes of plays to Maynard who was rung up 3 or 4 times at lunch by his colleagues at the Savoy. The ballet starts on Monday & he has no notion if it will crash or flourish. People no longer book ahead. Shaw said they used to book 6 weeks ahead.

(I skipped this page, so will insert here how I heard Maynard say to Mrs Shaw â€œWell, weâ€™re about as bad as we can be. Never been so bad. We may go over the edgeâ€”but as its never been like this, nobody knows. One would say we mustâ€â€”which was uttered in the low tone of a doctor saying a man was dying in the next room; but didnt want to disturb the company. This referred to the state of Europe, while we lunchedâ€”very well too.
