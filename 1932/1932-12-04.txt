### Sunday 4 December

I must finish the first partâ€”which is to be called 1880â€”in a day or two; & then freshen up: & read, for the next partâ€”1880-1900.

On Wednesday we gave our party: notable for its peeresses, its chatter, its cocktails: Ott, Ly Oxford, the Gagesâ€”& so on. Us two hussies entertaining the peerage: & boys in white jackets handing blue green yellow drinks. And my money Â£100â€”lent themâ€”did the trick. Rather a fertile way of spending money, though I may be landed with 4 great panels. My carpet, Duncanâ€™s, for the drawing room is come & down: & we have risen socially to the rank of the younger sons of baronetsâ€”it is like being real gentry, sitting with our feet embedded in pile.

And then, on Friday, we went to Brixton to Sophie. Maud a stout matron. Sophy presiding like a born lady. â€œThis is more of a party to me she said; indeed it wasâ€”more than the cocktail one.
