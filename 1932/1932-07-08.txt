### Friday 8 July

And so I fainted, at the Ivy: & had to be led out by Clive. A curious sensation. Feeling it come on; sitting still & fading out: then Clive by my side & a woman with salts. And the odd liberation of emotion in the cab with Clive; & the absolute delight of dark & bed: after that stony rattling & heat & Frankie shouting; & things being churned up, removed.

I write this on a blazing morning, because L. is instructing Miss C how to arrange the books: so that I cant correct articles. â€œEverywhere I look everything is hopelessâ€¦. Either the Northern Saga ought not to be here at allâ€”or it ought to be in the other roomâ€¦. (John is ill: publishing day yesterday; Harold drivelling snapping, when I hoped for â€˜serious criticismâ€™â€”why go on hoping?) the whole of thats going overâ€”Here are 3 things of Nature has no tune of wh. we dont sell a copy a yearâ€¦.â€

Oh dear, Iâ€™ve twenty minutes to use; & cant â€˜correctâ€™ any more. What a fling I shall have into fiction & freedom when this is off! At once, an American comes to ask me to consider writing articles for some huge figure. And (hushed be this said) I sent Nessa a cheque for Â£100 last night: & Leonard gave his mother Â£50, & Philip Â£50. These are among the solid good things, I think: Nessaâ€™s Â£100 will buy her some release from worry, I hope: Clive saying they must spend Â£600 a year less. Roger to have his operation, said to be slight, tomorrow. Adrian fretted to deathâ€”almost to fainting in the streetâ€”must anyhow stumble in to Nessaâ€™s & ask for water & spend the eveningâ€”by the vagaries of his Doris. This is what Francis foretold: a girl of dubious morality, & to me like a codfish in her person. And there are fleas at Mâ onks House: to which we go; & black beetles here, & said to be mice also.
