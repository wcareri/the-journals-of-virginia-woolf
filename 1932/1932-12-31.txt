### Saturday 31 December

This is in fact the last day of 1932, but I am so tired of polishing off Flushâ€”such a pressure on the brain is caused by doing ten pages dailyâ€”that I am taking a morning off, & shall use it here, in my lazy way, to sum up the whole of life. By that phrase, one of my colloquialities, I only mean, I wish I could deliver myself of a picture of all my friends, thoughts, doings, projects at this moment. Vita is on the high seas, sailing to America. Our new car came, vicariously, yesterdayâ€”we are lent one. And I had a long letter from Ottoline, of sheer affection, & one still longer from Ethel Smyth, of dubious jealousy & supressed temper & love strangled & out bursting. And Anrep wants to put me on the floor of the Bank of England as Clio, &â€”cards, thanks, catalogues of winter sales. On Monday we go up to Angelicaâ€™s party. On Tuesday we come back. And we shall be here till the 14th of Jan. And Miss Scott Johnson doesnâ€™t do. And we are us usual needing manuscripts; the dew pond is filling; the gold fish are dead; it is a clear pale blue eyed winters day; &â€”&â€”&â€”my thoughts turn with excitement to The Pargiters, for I long to feel my sails blow out, & to be careering with Elvira, Maggie & the rest over the whole of human life.

And indeed I cannot sum this up, being tired in my head. I think of Lytton too. Yes, of course this autumn has been a tremendous revelation. You will understand that all impediments suddenly dropped off. It was a great season of liberation. Everything appeared very distinct, amazingly exciting. I had no restrictions whatever, & was thus free to define my attitude with a vigour & certainty I have never known before. I laid about me & cut down the nettles. I said I will no longer be fettered by any artificial tie. I therefore spoke out in my own voice to Eddy & tried to subdue circumscribe Logan. Wellâ€”it is always doubtful how far one human being can be free. The ties are not purely artificial. One cannot cut a way absolutely straight. However, I secured a season of intoxicating exhilaration. Nor do I intend to let myself pay for it with the usual black despair. I intend to circumvent that supervening ghostâ€”that which always trails its damp wings behind my glories. I shall be very wary, very adeptâ€”as nowâ€”writing languidly to avoid a headache. To suppress one self & run freely out in joy, or laughter with impersonal joys & laughtersâ€”such is the perfectly infallible & simple prescription.

For example, with Julian & Lettice Ramsay last nightâ€”why not simply become fluid in their lives, if my own is dim? And to use ones hands & eyes; to talk to people; to be a straw on the river, now & thenâ€”passive, not striving to say this is this. If one does not lie back & sum up & say to the moment, this very moment, stay you are so fair, what will be oneâ€™s gain, dying? No: stay, this moment. No one ever says that enough. Always hurry. I am now going in, to see L. & say stay this moment.
