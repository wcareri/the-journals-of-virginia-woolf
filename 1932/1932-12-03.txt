### Saturday 3 December

Yes it was a long day & I had two days of jump jump afterwards; but owing to the caution of the cat on broken glass, I am now steadier. I was not â€˜on the sofaâ€™ yesterday; which has been my refuge after tea. And Iâ€™ve fought with Eddy; & with Logan; & L. is fighting with John; & we are the victors, I think, in all these fights: Iâ€™m rid of Eddy, have Logan to tea on his own terms; & John is in tears consulting his lawyer. But oh, how Iâ€™ve written since Oct 11th! So much that my fingers cant write, of an evening: my brain spins scene after scene. Its only the signs of some fatigue, & depression that leave me ten minutes now before lunch for this starved book.
