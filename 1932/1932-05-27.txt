Last night at Adrianâ€™s evening. Zuckerman on apes. Doris Chapman sitting on the floor. I afraid of Eddy coming inâ€”I wrote him a sharp, but well earned, letter. Adrian so curiously reminiscentâ€”will talk of his school of Greece of the past as if nothing had happened in between: a queer psychological fact in himâ€”this dwelling on the past, when thereâ€™s his present & his future all round him: D.C. to wit, & Karin coming in late, predacious, struggling, never amenable or comforting as poor woman no doubt she knows: deaf, twisted, gnarled, short, stockishâ€”baffled, still she comes. Dick Strachey. All these cold elements of a party not mingling. L. & I talk with some effort. Duncan wanders off. Nessa gone to Tarzan. We meet James & Alix in the door. Come & dine says James with the desire strong in him I think to keep hold of Lytton. Monkeys can discriminate between light & dark: dogs cant. Tarzan is made largely of human apes. People have libraries of wild beast â€˜shotsâ€™ let out on hire. Question how the lion fight was done. Real. Probably the lion was doped or had its claws cut. Talk of Greece. Talk of Spain. Dick was taken for a ghost. A feeling of distance & remoteness. Adrian sepulchral, polite, emaciated, elongated, scientific, called Adrian by Solly; then in come rapid small women, Hughes, & I think his wife. We evaporate at 11.20: courteously thanked for coming by Adrian. Question what pleasure these parties give. Some, presumably, or these singular figures wouldnâ€™t coagulate. A pouring wet day, & weâ€™re off to Rodmell for the week end. As for the Press, weâ€™re to see Haroldâ€™s woman on Tuesday & contemplate a re-arrangement: no John, no Hilda, but competent underlings; Belsher coming back after her holiday. Now for more articles. But I think one fortnight will see me through.
