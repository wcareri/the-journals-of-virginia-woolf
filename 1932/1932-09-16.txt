### Friday 16 September

Iâ€™m in such a tremor that Iâ€™ve botched the lastâ€”penultimate chapter of Flushâ€”is it worth writing that bookâ€”& can scarcely sit still, & must therefore scribble here, making myself form my letters, becauseâ€”oh ridiculous crumpled petalâ€”Wishart is publishing L.â€™s snap shot of me instead of the Lenare photograph & I feel that my privacy is invaded; my legs show; & I am revealed to the world (1,000 at most) as a plain dowdy old woman. How odd! I never gave the matter a thought till this morning. I sent the photographs off with some compunction at being too late. Now Iâ€™m all of a quiverâ€”cant read or write; & can, rightly, expect little sympathy from L. What an ill joined web of nervesâ€”to be kindâ€”my being is! A touch makes the whole thing quiver. What can it matter? The complex is: privacy invaded, ugliness revealedâ€”oh & that I was trapped into it by Wishart. Lord! One of the contributory causes is the auctioneers catalogue of the Rodmell sale. My ivy blooming walk is to be sold for building (the bees on the ivy bloomâ€”quoted one afternoon by Tom). A road is to be made from Deans to the down path. All is to be houses inside. Shall we try to buy? Is it worth saving one crumb when all is threatened? Yet on my walkâ€”too longâ€”I was tiredâ€”& leapt in my bed dreaming that Angelica was deadâ€”what a dreamâ€”how vividâ€”on my walk I almost felt my mind glow like hot ironâ€”so complete & holy was the old habitual beauty of England: the silver sheep clustering; & the downs soaring, like birds wings sweeping up & upâ€”I said myself that beauty had become almost entirely satisfactory (oh my legs in the snapshot). I mean, I can fasten on a beautiful day, as a bee fixes itself on a sunflower. It feeds me, rests me, satisfies me, as nothing else doesâ€”(well thats not quite true: when Nessa, Duncan & the children come I brim equally; but with a thinner, more exciting ardourâ€”I think a better heat & raptureâ€”but not this.) This has a holiness. This will go on after Iâ€™m dead.

A very good summer, this, for all my shying & jibbing, my tremors this morning. Beautifully quiet, airy, powerful. I believe I want this more humane existence for my nextâ€”to spread carelessly among oneâ€™s friendsâ€”to feel the width & amusement of human life: not to strain to make a pattern just yet: to be made supple, & to let the juice of usual things, talk, character, seep through me, quietly, involuntarily before I sayâ€”Stop, & take out my pen. Yes, my thighs now begin to run smooth: no longer is every nerve upright.

Yesterday we took plums to old Mrs Grey. She is shrunk, & sits on a hard chair in the corner, the door open. She twitches & trembles. Has the wild expressionless stare of the old. L. liked her despair: I crawls up to bed hoping for the day; & I crawls down hoping for the night. â€œIâ€™m an ignorant old womanâ€”cant write or read. But I prays to God every night to take meâ€”oh to go to my rest. Nobody can say what pains I suffer. Feel my shoulderâ€ & she began shuffling with a safety pin. I felt it. â€œHard as ironâ€”full of waterâ€”& my legs tooâ€â€”She pulled down her stocking. The dropsy. â€œIâ€™m ninety two; & all my brothers & sisters are dead; my daughters dead; my husband is deadâ€¦â€ She repeated her misery, her list of ills, over & over; could see nothing else; could only begin all over again; & kissed my hand, thanking us for our pound. This is what we make of our livesâ€”no reading or writingâ€”keep her alive with parish doctors when she wishes to dieâ€”Human ingenuity in torture is very great.
