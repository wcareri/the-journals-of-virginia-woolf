### Friday 22 July

I do not like Ethel when she is doing the powerful stuntâ€”or whatever stunt it is: proclaiming that all is over; denouncing me; protesting her love; whipping up a scene; being august; despairing; melodramatic, & wobbly & weak all at the same time. No I do not like it: & also I am bored. This is the old fashioned version of an emotional sceneâ€”the tactics are to leave the other person in a holeâ€”where indeed I would willingly have been left, if I had not remembered then all the letters I should have to write & the telephones: so I shouted after her, as she stumped down stairs, â€œDo you want your letters?â€ & as she tied them upâ€”the HB lettersâ€”I teased & railed, & felt the hollowness of it all, & her unattractive old ageâ€”not much else, so dusty & jaded I amâ€”& she wentâ€”in what mood I do not know. Its the superficiality of these things that disenchants one: her lust for emotion. Or so I felt. Seeing herself, dramatising herself instead of being anything.

But I am distraught & lazy: I am frittering away these last mornings experimenting with little stories; but, as L. says, the change makes all work impossible: the sorting; packing; like a dog one senses the move; then thereâ€™s Adrian tonight, & Julia & so on: then thereâ€™s Welwyn I think tomorrow. Nessa is gone; oh & my proofs will soon be coming; oh & I want to think out certain problems: & to be more vagarious: not yet to eat myself into a book. I want to go to Ireland, could that be managed. Are we too aloof, & absorbedâ€”this workâ€”whats the use of so much moneyâ€”familiar thoughts: also another novel: Desmond gets between, whyâ : his tepid praise; & the difficulty: peoples minds & bodies to be separated; & clothes; & demeanour; & the autumn; & our relations with people. Dine & sleep parties. &c.
