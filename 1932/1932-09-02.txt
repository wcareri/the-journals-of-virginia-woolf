### Friday 2 September

After this the wind blew & released all the prisonersâ€”so I thought, walking on the down above Lewes in the sudden slaty chill. But thats long past; & it is a sea fret today, as we had meant to go to Canterbury. As we had meantâ€”but whats the good of meaning when at any moment thereâ€™s a tapâ€”behold Tom & Vivienne: we cant buy our fish for dinner. But it was a friendly thought,â€”she wild as Opheliaâ€”alas no Hamlet would love her, with her powdered spotsâ€”in white satin, L. said; Tom, poor man, all battened down as usual, prim, grey, making his kind jokes with her. â€œOh but why didnâ€™t they tell me Adrian Stephen was your brother. Why? Why! Nobody mentioned it. They kept it from me.â€ Then her chops & changes. Where is my bag? Whereâ€”whereâ€”then a sudden amorous embrace for meâ€”& so on: trailing about the gardenâ€”never settlingâ€”seizing the wheel of their carâ€”suddenly telling Tom to driveâ€”all of which he bears with great patience: feeling perhaps that his 7 months of freedom draw near. In the middle of their tea the post came with an astonishing letter from John to say that he does not intend to carry out our agreement. He has left the press. L. says he will send no answer. What could one say indeed? What a blessing! That egotistical young man with all his jealousies & vanities & ambitions, his weakness & changeableness is no loss. But weâ€”or L. has lost an infinity of time. I suppose the severity with wh. L. was speaking to him on Friday when I came in to say Teas ready upset his trembling apple cart: his vanity could no longer endure: so he threw up the sponge, but I must say with the least possible good manners or consideration. On the whole though what a mercy. Now I can roam about the basement unperturbed. And, coming from him, with this crashing folly, one can take the line of least resistanceâ€”neednâ€™t attempt the amicable go betweenâ€”neednâ€™t ask him to dinner.

A happy lively summer thisâ€”& I enjoy my freak of writing Flushâ€”& think it a good ideaâ€”this easy indolent writing once in a wayâ€”to let my brain cool; & here I am, asked to write about â€˜my fatherâ€™ in the Times. No. So to give old Mrs Grey her basket of plums. The Common Reader went off on Monday last.
