### Tuesday 29 March

We went to Sissinghurstâ€”Iâ€™m so tired with correcting Dr Burney that I must run my pen hereâ€”& it was a fine goose grey morning. Odd the merging of Sussex into Kent. The sloping hop oasts do it, I think: then the little sunk away villages: what led people to pitch on the 18th century where they did? A tudor house, alone; on the road: why build there? L. notices the way; I these little facts. Harold came out in a torn jacket: Vita in breeches & pink shirt. We went over the grounds. H. said Iâ€™m getting nobler & nobler as we get poorer. Iâ€™ve refused an offer to write for the American papers. Oh but there are myriads of things to do here. â€œYes we want to turn those stables into guest bedrooms: & build a library across the courtyardâ€, said Vita. All is planned. H. has drawn it in his note book. Walls have been built & turf laid. Lunch in the boys cottage. Talk of Beaverbrookâ€™s party to wh. H. went with Enid Jonesâ€”Oh so lovelyâ€”the clothes; then to Heinemann: people seemed to have dust scattered on them. Enid became quite upset. How she wants to write, but has to give parties for her husband. And I was sleepy & afraid the Rolls Royce wd. get to the Temple too quick & sheâ€™d not have finished her story. But she had finished it. And next day I got a letter to say that she had almostâ€”killed herself? I suggestedâ€”no, broken down. She wants to be a writer. Envies the genius of Mrs Belloc Lowndes.

So we ate cold salmon & raspberries & cream & little variegated chocolates given by Lady Sackville, now at their feet, & drank oh lots of drinks; & then climbed Vitaâ€™s tower; lovely pink brick; but like Knole, not much view, save of stables that are to be guest rooms. So home. And then a very wet Sunday & a prodigious reading & drowsingâ€”Iâ€™ve now carried to perfection the art of sleeping & reading & make up half my book in the wildest way asleep, improvising, & then surprised to wake up & find none of it true.

Yesterday we went to Rottingdean to tea with Maurice (as Iâ€™m now to call him.) He & Elizabeth in a long sunny room full of books, tables, plants; rather bad taste; rich; nothing very nice to look at; two sweating dusty footmen brought in innumerable plates. In came Ethel: in grey tweed; & a chinless Cavalry Captain called Grant, who is Peter Daviesâ€™ partner: the very spit & image of a soldier in Punch: many peoples ideal, I daresay; so suave, masculine, foolish; exactly a round peg in his hole. All the slang right & the snobbery & the culture & the self-possession. Had killed animals in every part of the East. Talk, of course, wildly detailed & emphatic & useless about Greece. You must see Meleoraâ€”whereâ€™s the map? You get out of the trainâ€”you get a carâ€”no we couldntâ€”go to Giolman in Athensâ€”oh & dont forget Aegina: you must hire a boatâ€”oh that evening.. &c &c. And then talk about publishing: & I slipped my anchovy sandwich into my bag, & took it out, thinking it was my lighter. Ethel balanced by the fire: told us stories about Empresses: Maurice prompted: laughed at her. â€œIâ€™ve known him 40 years & heâ€™s always shockedâ€”feels what people feel at the other end of the room. Nice feelings. I havenâ€™t any. Iâ€™m going to write a book called The Mole, the Cesspool & Mrs Woolf. Youâ€™ve kept my letters you sayâ€”Yes sheâ€™s a strange womanâ€”loves getting lettersâ€”so I write, sheet after sheet. Nothing I like better. I used to keep a diary. Since I knew her, two years ago in February, Iâ€™ve written only lettersâ€¦â€

And Mrs Woolf we want you to write a biography for us in 30,000 words. Youâ€™d pay a devil Â£15 to get up the facts for you. Then youâ€™d have nothing to do but dash it down. Youâ€™d do it in two months. By way of bargain Iâ€™ll offer you the MS of a gardening book. Oh weâ€™ve lost heavily over our expensive books. Dizzyâ€™s edition fills our cellar. Iâ€™ve come in to make us less high brow. I want novels. Ideas. Thats whats the fun. Making suggestions to authorsâ€”That chinless man to suggest to me. Pah! So home; after seeing Mâ auriceâ€™s bedrooms &c. A shy, lobster coloured skinless man; tripping about the room to fetch things. Keeps his house, I think, for his friends. Drinks. Sentimentalises. Would like to be taken seriously.
