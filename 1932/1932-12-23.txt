### Friday 23 December

This is not the first day of the new year; but the discrepancy may be forgiven. I must write off my dejected rambling miseryâ€”having just read over the 30,000 words of Flush & come to the conclusion that they wonâ€™t do. Oh what a wasteâ€”what a bore! Four months of work, & heaven knows how much readingâ€”not of an exalted kind eitherâ€”& I cant see how to make anything of it. Its not the right subject for that length: its too slight & too serious. Much good in it but would have to be much better. So here I am two days before Christmas, pitched into one of my grey welters. True, its partly over writing The Pargiters. But I cant get back into Flush, ever, I feel: & L. will be disappointed; & the money loss tooâ€”thats a bore. I took it up impetuously after The Waves by way of a change: no forethought in me; & so got landed: it would need a months hard workâ€”& even then I doubt it. In that time I might have done Dryden & Pope. And Iâ€™m thus led to beginâ€”no to end the year with a doleful plaint. It is blazing hot; like spring, with the bees on the flowers. Never mind; this is not a reverse of the first orderâ€”not at all.
