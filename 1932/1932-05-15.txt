### Sunday 15 May

And now, Whit Sunday, here we are at Monks House, & Greece is perceptibly melting: just for a moment England & Greece stood side by side, each much enlivened by the other. When we landed, the English coast seemed long low sweeping empty. I exclaimed at the extraordinary English greenâ€”with its silver mixture; & L. said the earth had an unbaked lookâ€”no red in it; & the lines of the hills so sloping. Now our road seems a garden path. This was Greece still active in our eyes. But its force is waning. Already my mind is hard at work (in my absence) arranging, editing, bringing forward, eliminating, until it will present me, unasked, with visions, as I walk, of Aegina, of Athensâ€”the Acropolis with the incandescent pillars; the view from the goatherds hill at Delphiâ€”no, the process is not yet complete enough for me to have detached pictures. Last nights gossip at Charleston has further strewn sand over Greece. And my head has settled down; & my body is rapidly using itself to arm chairs & soft beds & English meat & Jam.
