### Thursday 10 March

And the peaches were bad last night.

And we had Roger Jack & Mary to dine.

And they said the saddle was raw, but it wasnâ€™t. And oh dear I had lunched with Raymond to meet Mrs Keppel; a swarthy thick set raddled direct (My dear, she calls one) old grasper: whose fists have been in the money bags these 50 years: but with boldness: told us how her friends used to steal, in country houses in the time of Ed. 7th. One woman purloined any jewelled bag left lying. And she has a flat in the Ritz; old furniture; &c. I liked her, on the surface. I mean the extensive, jolly, brazen surface of the old courtezan; who has lost all bloom; & acquired a kind of cordiality, humour, directness instead. No sensibilities as far as I could see; nor snobberies: immense superficial knowledge, & going off to Berlin to hear Hitler speak. Shabby under dress: magnificent furs: great pearls: a Rolls Royce waitingâ€”going off to visit my old friend the tailor; & so onâ€”But Iâ€™m fuddled with talk, & weâ€™re starting for Ham Spray to talk to Carringtonâ€”dear, dearâ€”a lovely day though.

Oh & Eddy says The Waves is a failure: a miss. Eddy pushed his way in; & I liked him for pushing, once I had done hating him. How formidable I must be.
