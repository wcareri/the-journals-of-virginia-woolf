### Friday 26 February

Now I have â€˜finishedâ€™ the Arcadia, & have 25 minutes in which I ought to correct my Letter to a Young Poet & give it to John. John is fractious & irritable, said to be the effect of love. And what a mint of people Iâ€™ve seen; dining with Ethel, having Desmond & Lord David & Ottoline & the Keynesâ€™, & going to Monks Houseâ€”so march-white & lovely, the fields, & the river where the man caught a large sea trout, trout die if you draw blood, he said, speaking very slowly, wind bitten, that bitter cold day: & then I sawâ€”oh the Keynesâ€”yesâ€”they say Julianâ€™s dissertation is no good, quite uneducatedâ€”& talked of Lytton, & how Maynard thought we really carried unconvention too farâ€”no service, no farewell. When Ramsey died his friends went to Golders Green & the coffin was carried through them. But with Lytton there was no mark to say This is over. And he met Senhouse a fortnight later & was the first to tell him that Lytton had left him his books.

Then Iâ€™ve not seen Ethel this 2 weeks, because of the rush; & today Sibyl & Hugh & Eth Williamson all come, knocking on each others heels to tea; & we go to the Camargo on Sunday; & must go in to the Woolf 50 birthdayâ€”this will happen yearly nowâ€”â after dinner tonight. And to the French pictures. And Ka shut me in the middle class bedroom effectively last nightâ€”so condescending, so self approving, with her docile stories of respectable lunches with the Cornish aristocracy & Mrs Leverton Harris. Who is Mrs L.H.? â€œOh dont you knowâ€”she signs letters on George Mooreâ€™s 80th birthday. And I do hope you will do more Common readers. I prefer them to â€”â€”â€ This little bit of patronage annoyed me more than it should.

The day Ka came too we sold the ten thousandth copy of The Waves: which thus beats all my novels, unexpectedly.
