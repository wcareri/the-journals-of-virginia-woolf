Conversation piece: Monday Feb. 1st 1932. 5.30 pm.

I am reading Wellsâ€™ science of life, & have reached the hen that became a cock or vice versa. Nelly talks at the door. I hear a characteristic slow & heavy stamp. Then a bold tap at the drawing room door. In comes Ethel Smyth in her spotted fur, like an unclipped & rather overgrown woodland wild beast, species indeterminate. She wears, as usual, her 3 cornered Frederick the Great hat, & one of her innumerable relay of tweed coats & skirts. She carries a leather satchel. Before she has sat down she is talking. â€œReally I think that building of the kind you describe at Rodmell is worse than death. After all one may say of death its natural: but this is a wanton desecration. Why your downs? Oh I know L. wouldnâ€™t agree; but theres my Rupert Gwynne. He said, he pounced like a wolf on the fold the other day when they were talking against landlordsâ€”We, & I hope all my family for ever, he said, refuse to sell our land. We think beauty is something to keep. We sacrifice moneyâ€”Wellâ€”Yes Iâ€™m exhaustedâ€”Two hours injection .. Not tea, no: but vermouth. It wont make me tipsy? Oh Iâ€™m worn out (but she looks like a ruddy sea captain or old apple woman.) Nowâ€”questions. But I had such a good visit from Eddy. Heâ€™s writing a novel to show that the virtues of the aristocracy, in which I firmly believe though L. doesntâ€”must survive. Why not in his own person then I asked? Be noble magnanimous serene, instead of petty spiteful & egotistical. Oh thats his digestion: I assure you heâ€™s a phenomenon. Musical. How I pity him! forced to live in England with that giftâ€”you dont know the loneliness. Compare the people at. They talk of cricket golf: in Berlin, they have their ham & beer & talk of the way the violin plays the G sharp. Eddy has the duties of his positionâ€”a very great one: very real duties. Heâ€™s a man of the worldâ€”L. despises that. I love it. What was I going to sayâ€”He played Der Wald. He said nobody knows Ethel Smyth till theyve heard all this. Who made the theme? I did. Well its the pure flower of the romantic movement. And we sat reading our books & he played & played. He has a character of his ownâ€”an original point of view. Oh yes I agree. And he has a deep feeling for you. But how could I make anything of Mary Dodge under four years he said? Sheâ€™d look wild, & hook the salt cellar to her with her silver claw. V. would make something very amusing of it. Does not everybody take a back place once youâ€™ve known V. I asked. Poor Eddy pumped up the necessary affirmation. Oh my dear dont I know it allâ€”(reference to Lytton) those poor Stracheys: & you who care for so few people. But I must catch my train this time. Iâ€™m taking care of myself. Iâ€™m worn out. Here are the tickets for the lecture tomorrow in case you can come. My dear V. dont freeze me offâ€”I beg of you. No I cant write to youâ€”Iâ€™m completely taken upâ€”three treatments a week. Beecham rang up at eleven. Heâ€™s going to do the Prison this year. And I wrote to Mrs Snowdenâ€”Iâ€™m old enough to be your mother. You sayâ€¦. (these final words were rattled off on the doorstep).
