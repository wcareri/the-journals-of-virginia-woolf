### Thursday 13 October

It was an odd sightâ€”Desmond with Rachel on his arm. Everybody stood up. The white & red procession with the cross in front went ahead. Then very small, smooth, pale & sleek appeared Rachel & Desmond arm in arm. I have never seen him as a father. Now he was thatâ€”gentle, kindâ€”leading his daughter. She was a wax workâ€”with her diamond cross; very pale; very small; carrying a white book. Oh but the inadequacy of the serviceâ€”the sense of its being the entirely obsolete & primitive voice of a defunct tribal magnate, laying down laws for the government of the tribe: & then these civilised sceptical people letting themselves pretend that they obey. That clogged & diluted all the real feeling. And Davidâ€™s high collar & tails: & their sober, decorous backs kneeling there: & the respectability & the wavering watery music: the perpetual compromise. I sat with Hope. Opposite were the sort of women one sees in Oxford St. at midday. (11.30). The bridegrooms side was notably better tailored & more distinguished than oursâ€”where, as I imagine, all the Ritchies & so on had come, saying well, Iâ€™m a first cousin so I neednâ€™t buy new gloves. Molly was much as a pouter pigeon in some maroon dress with a yellow bunch. The ceremony went decorously forward in that grey brown church. Now & then one heard a shout from the market. No I dont like the ceremony. They hauled a dilapidated bishop up by the armpits to give the blessing which he did in a trembling overemphatic voice, as if he were scrubbing the heads of David & Rachel as he called them. Then a sort of inner play went forward behind glass doors. One saw Salisburys & MacCs signing books. Then a dribble back of relatives. Then the Wagner wedding march. Then David & Rachel arm in arm sleep walking down the aisle preceded by a cross which ushered them into a car & so into a happy long life, I make no doubtâ€”but thats not the ceremony I likeâ€”oh no not at all. And following in the wake of the sleep walkers came the Salisburys & the MacCarthys arm in arm: dwindling into Dermod & a wizened old ladyâ€”presumably old Mrs M. â€œTheyre hideously plainâ€ Hope kept sayingâ€”indeed green grey light at midday off old stone is not genialâ€”oh & I wanted some raptureâ€”some precious stone to hold. None. None. Only endless small observationsâ€”Hubert Câ , carrying two umbrellasâ€”Ralph & Frances in grey tweedsâ€”lateâ€”taking prominent places. Lady Oxford, Lady Hartington, Ly Colefax, Maurice Baring & so on. A queer little dolls face, Rachelâ€™s, to harbour a passion, to bear children. And I got washed up against the Bishop going out, & heard him apologise to the cleric. But it is an honour to support a Bishop, said that man. And then they began talking about so & so, Colonel of the Scotts guards, & so to the episcopal motor car, which was holding up the meat salesmenâ€”with its gold cross. And now Desmond is stretched out by the fire in slippers, preparing his BBC talk I daresay: & Rachel & David areâ€”shall we sayâ€”in a first class reserved carriage going to Sherborne: & he is putting the rug straight over her knees; & she is looking at the fields, thinking Why has the whole world been given me: then they have tea: I should think he will be shy tonight.

Today the CR is out & I havent give it a thought, being entirely absorbed in my Essay, which I began yesterday. The last 3 or four days Iâ€™ve done parcels in a daze: Belsher ill; 6,000 Family History to be despatched: a great bundle of orders found last night hidden in a drawer.

But I still see the two doll figures kneelingâ€”for all the world like a pictureâ€”what do I mean? Iâ€™m too sleepy to say. And now for Spender.
