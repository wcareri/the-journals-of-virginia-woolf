### Thursday 2 June

Lord Davidâ€™s party last night. Half across London. Derby night. Great motors full of men with buttonholes. A rose pink girl tripping across Shâ aftesburâ y Avenue hand in hand with a young man: all fluff & roses. Edwardes Sqre very large leafy silent Georgian refined: so too no. 41 with its white & green; its one printâ€”but nothing definite enoâ€™ for my taste: Ly Salisbury by Sargent over the mantelpiece; a butler; an orange cat; Ld D. & Eth Bowen talking by the fire; then Puffin, then John Sparrow. Not a good dinner: meagre; exiguous; & I took too many asparagus. All adroit kind nice talkâ€”the note of the Asquiths & Cecils. â€˜How very trueâ€™â€”â€˜Yes, I agree entirelyâ€™â€”so different from Bâ loomsbury. Theres more body to us. Still I dont complain. A little confabulation about Eddy: then about crying at crowds, at theatres, at films; what is tragic; about football. Spâ arrow. is a bailer, a solid young man, just called to Chancery Bar who writes a life of Donne after dinner. Talk about Auden & Naomi Mitchison: her review of Auden read aloud: Aeschylus â€œ& all that lotâ€. How she went to a party with corn in her hair: how her group knocks people down; how they pig in the Ellisâ€™s hotel; how she loves, poses, writes but its not really good, says David. Then they talked about the German youth movement: about bad people: aboutâ€”Lindsey who likes lice in the head; about Murry; & I wore my new dress, too white & young perhaps; & so came home across London, & must now wash for Maynardâ€™s lunch & the Bernard Shawsâ€”oh damn, oh damnâ€”not an idea in my head or a wish to be brilliant
