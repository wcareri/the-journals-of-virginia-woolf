### Saturday 16 July

Stella Benson last night: as quiet, as controlled, white, drawn as usual, also deaf: with steady honest eyes; said she had been to a great many parties. â€œI just say nothing. I feel none of these people matters. They say how much they liked my book .. I was given a medal. The old gentleman couldnt remember what for. He pinned it on. Both my dogs are dead. I liked one for bounding. But that was only a sign of Stannardâ€™s disease. I go back in Augustâ€”to Linlon (or some such name) a mud island. I hate Hong Kong. They play games. At Government House they give you a slip of paper with names of games on it: you have to put a cross next the one you play. Sitting out is one. James & I choose that. So we sit out together.â€ That was her style in a very weak but persistent voice; she coughs; & then goes on with a mild persistent patience. She is bleached; even her blue eyes are bleached. But at the same time sheâ€™s practical; realistic: talked, of course, of â€œPearnieâ€â€”doesnt like herâ€”& making money by stories; & Harpers & so on; in a sensible matter of fact way, like a working class woman. Then smiles with her charming steady eyes. The light faded grey in the drawing room, & she sat there lying back telling us in a very low voice, which went on steadily about the slave trade in H.K.; about James & his little Chinese destroyer, manned by ex-officers from England; how they steam out after sailing ships: the ships cant escape; they throw out bales of cotton & flannel: which float: James goes aboard & discovers the deck laden with opium, heroin; man cries out â€œThat little parcelâ€™s for my father. Let me have thatâ€. Then all the other men say that the cement &c is a present for an aunt. Thereâ€™s always fighting. Chinese planes come over very low down. Shoot with revolvers. She sits in her kitchen. All the inhabitants crowd round, thinking the English safeâ€”pretend theyâ€™re selling eggs. Chinese generals come to dine & stand rifles on each side of their chairs: send soldiers into the kitchen to see that the food isnâ€™t poisoned. She goes back for another two years. Writes & writes. Must buzz home in her little Morris Cowley to write 8 pages of her monthly notes for Time & Tide. I ask why? Oh its good pay. Has bought a house in Kensington. Will come back for 2 years with James, who will be The Oâ€™Gorman. All this serious, weary, intent. I like her & was glad to sign her Waves.
