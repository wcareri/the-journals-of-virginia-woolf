### Monday 29 February

And this morning I opened a letter; & it was from â€˜yours very sincerely J.Â J. Thompsonâ€â€”the Master of Trinity; & it was to say that the council have decided to ask me to deliver the Ford Clark Lectures next year. Six of them. This, I suppose, is the first time a woman has been asked; & so it is a great honourâ€”think of me, the uneducated child reading books in my room at 22 H.P.G.â€”now advanced to this glory. But I shall refuse: because how could I write 6 lectures, to be delivered in full term, without giving up a year to criticism; without becoming a functionary; without sealing my lips when it comes to tilting at Universities; without putting off my Knock at the Door; without perhaps shelving another novel. But I am rather inclined to smile, as I lunch with Miss Dodge today, & she gives me a book with Donneâ€™s autograph; as I buy a pair of shoes at Babers; as I sit down dutifully to correct an article for the Common Reader. Yes; all that reading, I say, has borne this odd fruit. And I am pleased; & still more pleased that I wont do it; & like to think that father would have blushed with pleasure could I have told him 30 years ago, that his daughterâ€”my poor little Ginnyâ€”was to be asked to succeed him: the sort of compliment he would have liked.
