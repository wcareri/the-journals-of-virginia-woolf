### Friday 1 January

This is to be quite frank the 1st Jan. 1932, but I will pretend that it is still 1931: so that I may spend the 25 minutes to lunch writing here. I will bring a new book down tomorrow. The truth is I cannot writeâ€”but must scribble. My attempt to polish up Johnâ€™s letter in the lodge yesterday was a failure. Am I more severe, deeper, less of a flibbertigibbet now than of old, so that writing exacts a closer screw?â€”& my head is twisted with the effort? I think that possible. Anyhow, I must sail over the 7 days left here as smoothly, vacantly, serenely as may be. And use this page to sail on.

Waves have sold 9,650â€”Deluge 440 (?)

Yesterday we had Keynesâ€™s & Bells to tea. Mrs Courtauld is dead. Lytton, as I must believe, very slowly mending. And I must repay a vow made in my sorrowâ€”to send Â£10 yearly to old Sophie. Only when my brains dry up I feel nervous. Action is deadâ€”O these dogsâ€”thats my present curse. And one must learn to overcome it somehow. This irregular sharp bark is the devil. Ear stoppers? Clive as bright as a bullfinch. We talked of going to bed in front of Angelica. And of Desmondâ€™s maniacal liesâ€”â€œI have posted the articleâ€ when he hasnâ€™t written it. And of the Stracheys;â€”Nessaâ€™s description of the lounge at the Bear filled with Stracheys reading detective novels in despair. In comes Ralph. Silence. â€œWould you like to come, Pernel?â€ Pernel elongates herself & goes to get ready. â€œGently fading away?â€ says Oliver. Ralph nods. Dorelia is summoned to be with Carrington, who will commit suicide they think. She leaves. Wires for a little bag with some money that she took out of Johnâ€™s dressing gownâ€”he might be annoyed. A man appears with the bag. Is this yours? They look & find Â£300 in notes inside. (I am now stopped against the dogs; but it is difficult to write stoppered; & foolish; & an extravagant demand on me by Miss Dixey; & if a knock were to come I should not hearâ€”& the dog after all may stop barking.) Carrington moving about scarcely knowing people: Pippa violently self-controlled; Saxon helping byâ€”I forget what; Tommie helping, too, but summoned to comfort his parents for the death of Garrow in an air spill; & the Stracheys, all grey, all woollen, all red nosed, swollen eyed, logical, quiet, exact, doing cross word puzzles; thinking of Lytton. And that afternoon (Christmas Eve) Lytton said â€œIf its only keeping me alive a little longer, dontâ€. And so they did nothing; but then he drank tea & milk with brandy & enjoyed them, & the Dr happily had some serum, injected it, & so the turnâ€”if turn they call itâ€”began. This is a scene I can see; & see Lytton too, always reasonable, clear, giving his orders; & dying as he thought; & then, as reasonably, finding some strength returning, deciding to live. And L. & I sobbing here. And I expect Nessa & Clive sitting over the fire late, with some tears, at Seend.

During the last days here, they have been putting up a great erection of girders on the bank opposite Asheham. Is this an overhead railway or an engine house? So another view of the downs is lost forever. And Anny repeats vague gossip that there is to be a series of factories between Newhaven & Lewes: are we doomed to goâ€”or to stay on & be worried out of all walks, all views, & become crusted over with villas?
