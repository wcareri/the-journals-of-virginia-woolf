### Wednesday 3 February

These conversation pieces are artfully contrived to assuage me, about 11.30, after toiling at correcting Donne, who is to introduce the second volume of the Common Reader. I cant go on squeezing my sentences dry of water; & so write here for 20 minutes; then I think read Donne; then finish with a novel upon Hamlet, clever, oh yesâ€”novels about Hamlet always are. Then lunch: thenâ€”Oh Ottoline this evening. Yet I am so much interested in Donne, or in my views that I cannot begin.

Last night then, at Cliveâ€™s. Roger, Nessa, Duncan. Clive in his brown tea cosy with the strap hanging down indecently like a tail between his legs. Roger rather shrunk up. Sherry. Lottie says dinner. Down we go to the lovely gay room with blue & white chairs. The character of Gerald Heard. D. makes a subtle distinction. â€œNo its not that he prevents me from doing my little owl. Its not that I dislike his factsâ€”I can absorb facts from some people. It is that he sets up no relation between himself & me so that I cannot relate his facts to anything.â€ R.: But he has passion of mind. V.: He is an ascetic. He refused my cigar. R.: Yet he doesnâ€™t disapprove of the senses. D. He sees nothing. Clive: He loves me, but I find him dryer, more juiceless than a banana. He walks down Bond Street with Raymond & says What a wonderful companion Raymond is because he notices the flags. (Van:) â€œhe notices nothing sensual. We live in our senses. He pours forth all those intelligent remarks about the Satanist picture.â€ Here I saw Clive look at Lyttonâ€™s picture. â€œDont have it moved. Have it cleaned, by all means, but it looks very nice there. Its the best thing of Lytton. R. And that horrid vulgar picture by Henry is the one people will know him by. Thats rather summary of course (to D.) Vir: But its far the most like. R. I did a portrait of Lytton, writing E. Victorians at Durbins. Vir: Iâ€™m a little annoyed that he left all his old books to Senhouse. Clive. And his will? Iâ€™ve heard nothing. No, Roger, I dont think you understand. Nothing, humanly speaking, is more unlikely, in fact impossible, than that Râ alph. should go back to Carrington. He opened his heart to me once â€¦ D.: Well, Iâ€™m fonder of Frances than of any of them; but I think as a human being, she might have behaved differently. I think so. C. But you dont understand, Duncan. She was passionately in loveâ€”is stillâ€”with R. So when it came to the pointâ€”I mustnâ€™t come this week endâ€”one shade of pressure from himâ€”how could she resist it? Lyttonâ€™s letters couldnâ€™t be publishedâ€”they would hurt everybody too much. We protested. Well what about the Nortons? â€œIâ€™ve just met a youth who has been a bugger since the age of puberty?â€ Vir: Oh buggeryâ€™s explodedâ€”nobody could mind that now.

Wells on life: facts: Roger & I love to have facts poured over us. Clive only likes facts if they are related to something human. A great many small vegetables, handed by Lottie. The ice too hard.

So we went upstairs & then we saidâ€”that France was combining against Japan. L. gave his views on the subject of war with China & Japan. We said that war is the dullest of all things. Not naval war, said Duncan. He had a cousin Admiral Arbuthnot, who lost all his ships. That was exciting. Only for ten minutes, I said. Roger said could we not get up a society of artists to protest against the protection of works of art. Meninsky is ill & has sent the hat round. There is no public fund for helping paintersâ€”only writers. What about William Jowitt said Clive, rubbing his hands. Thats a good jokeâ€”Poor Williamâ€™s off to the West Indies. Iâ€™m glad morality is vindicated, I said. No, I dont think politics ought to be a matter of Oxford & Cambridge, said Roger. Thats what I wrote & told him when the row was on, said Clive. Lesley liked itâ€”she liked dressing up & being at Court. It was she who forced him to itâ€”telephoning from the basement among the black beetles, I said. Good Earth is a wonderful book, Roger said. It has a quality of objectivity & calm; a new kind of beauty, though the womanâ€™s name is Pearl Buck & sheâ€™s an American. Baron Corvo is a good writer said Clive. Once when I was editing the Athenaeum he wrote & said he cdnâ€™t get absolution & though not destitute required more money in order to write. He had my entire sympathy.

Roger went early; stopping his car by the pillarbox, venturously; twice he left the room to see if it were stolen. So to stories of Julian, the war game, Quentinâ€™s love affair, & so all talking we parted, Clive to be away in Rome for two months.
