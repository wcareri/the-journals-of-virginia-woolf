Now I have â€œfinishedâ€ David Copperfield, & I say to myself cant I escape to some pleasanter atmosphere? Cant I expand & embalm & become a sentient living creature! Lord how I suffer! What a terrific capacity I possess for feeling with intensityâ€”now, since we came back, Iâ€™m screwed up into a ball; cant get into step; cant make things dance; feel awefully detached; see youth; feel old; no, thats not quite it; wonder how a year or 20 perhaps is to be endured. Think, yet people do live; cant imagine what goes on behind faces. All is surface hard; myself only an organ that takes blows, one after another; the horror of the hard raddled faces in the flower show yesterday; the inane pointlessness of all this existence; hatred of my own brainlessness & indecision: the old treadmill feeling, of going on & on & on; for no reason: Lyttonâ€™s death; Carringtonâ€™s; a longing to speak to him; all that cut away, gone. Eddyâ€™s idiotic letter; the peevishness & egotism of Eddy; of John; the hardness & competitiveness of life; no space which one can expand in & say Time stand still here; L.â€™s goodness, & firmness; & the immense responsibility that rests on him. What to do about the press, about Hilda, about John; women; my book on professions; shall I write another novel; contempt for my lack of intellectual power; reading Wells without understanding; Nessaâ€™s children; society; buying clothes; Rodmell spoilt; all England spoilt; terror at night of things generally wrong in the universe; buying clothes; how I hate Bond Street & spending money on clothes; worst of all is this disjected barrenness. And my eyes hurt; & my hand trembles.

A saying of Leonardâ€™s comes into my head in this season of complete inanity & boredom â€œThings have gone wrong somehowâ€. It was the night Carrington killed herself. We were walking along that silent blue street with the scaffolding. I saw all the violence & unreason crossing in the air: ourselves small; a tumult outside: something terrifying: unreason. Shall I make a book out of this? It would be a way of bringing order & speed again into my world.
