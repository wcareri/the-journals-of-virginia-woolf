### Saturday 13 February

I break off from my plain duty which is to read the Anatomy of the World, to record Rogerâ€™s lecture: last night. Roger rather cadaverous in white waistcoat. A vast sheet. Pictures passing. He takes his stick. Gets into trouble with the lanternist. Is completely at his ease. Elucidates unravels with fascinating ease & subtlety this quality & that: investigates (with his stick) opposing diagonals: emphasises the immediate & instantaneous in French art. Here a Queen about to fling out her fingers: here a mother â€œturning to look at something & losing herself in pensive & tender reverie, while her child struggles to look the other way, & she restrains it, unconsciously, with perfect ease & control.â€ In the interval we talked to Mary, about the affair of Potocki which is filling our house, & making ring our telephone. (This man is sentenced to 6 months prison because he submitted for private publication the MS of a poem dedicated to John Penis in the Mount of Venus, to pay for which effusion Leonard has committed himself to find Â£20). Up drifted Nessa & Duncan & Raymond in a tiger sweater; & so back to more lecture; & so home, through icy streetsâ€”winter is on usâ€”I write with both sides of my fire on, & my winter jerseyâ€”so to Nessaâ€™s, where the stove was kindled, & there was hot soup & cold meat, & coffee & biscuitsâ€”all with the usual skill & organising capacity. There we laughed & exaggerated: about the lecture; about Bob & his outburstâ€”â€˜I cant stay in your houseâ€”I must leave, if you impute such motives to my friendâ€”heâ€™s dyingâ€”a better socialist than you areâ€”I am appalled at the meanness of human nature. Heres Allen, the wisest political thinker of our timeâ€”& youâ€™ve nothing but abuse of him for taking a peerage. It dont matter of courseâ€”heâ€™ll kill himselfâ€”heâ€™ll be dead by next year. No I oughtnâ€™t to say thisâ€”Iâ€™m sorry I lost my temper. I apologiseâ€™ (eating muffins; seizing the teapot, like some shaggy, surly, unkempt old animalâ€”And then we had to give him a lift to Chelsea ..)

And we talked about a new life of Jesus, which offers two proofs of his existenceâ€”witness Rogerâ€™s intellectual vitality after speaking to the Queenâ€™s Hall for 2 hoursâ€”really excited about the reality of Jesus. Quentin quoted French with a nice accent. Duncan had bought a pine apple with the extra 25/ I paid on his money for the screenâ€”that now lights up the drawing room. I brought it home on Thursday. Bob never noticed.
