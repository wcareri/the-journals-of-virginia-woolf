### Saturday 18 June

Adrian rings up & says â€œCan you suggest a tenant for two rooms? Weâ€™re in the throes of dividing things up.â€ Whether he goes & Karin stays, I dont know. John stays, on a revised basis, as adviser; Miss Scott Johnson as permanent manager; & I am to consult & help John more, & not to sit here â€œwith a red cross on your door, so that I darenâ€™t come in.â€ My advice is that he shall be more malleable, & less pernickety. He craves influence & authority, to publish the books of his friends: wishes to start a magazine; is poor; ~~cant do without pay~~; must economise; live with Peggy in Pimlico. Am I too aloofâ€”partly so as not to chatter, partly to get to my own work? Ought one to be more sympathetic; but oh so many people to see & things to fit in already: nevertheless Iâ€™ll try, if the new method is to be tried. He says Leonard is â€œso deep: & plans things; & never comes out at once with what he means; so that I dont know how to behave.â€ I daresay weâ€™ve spent 10 hours talking about all this. Ethel more than usually controlled. Headaches skirmishing. Oh & Iâ€™m finishing the C.R.: I trust to God; have done the last article, & hope to send off to be typed tomorrow. Desmondâ€™s criticism rather sends my value up in my eyes: canâ€™t make a dint in a pat of butter. Man of the word. Respectable, acute, astute, to the point.

Nessa & Duncanâ€™s private view. Tatlock smelling of drink. Horsey arty people. Agnews. Mrs Grant. Mrs Rendel. All this moving round the pictures, & I meeting Ethel in electric blue & Quentin: & she telling us at Stewarts how Miss Liddell rolled down the steps at Marlborough House dead drunk.
