### Thursday 17 March

So Carrington killed herself; & again what L. calls â€œthese mausoleum talksâ€ begin again. We were the last to talk to her, & thus might have been summoned to the inquest; but they brought it in an accident. She maintained this, even to Ralph. Her foot slipped as she was shooting a rabbit.

And we discuss suicide; & I feel, as always, ghosts (dwindling) changing. Lyttonâ€™s affected by this act. I sometimes dislike him for it. He absorbed herâ [,] made her kill herself. Then the romantic completeness which affects Mary, â€˜a beautiful gestureâ€”her life & her deathâ€™. Nonsense says Leonard: it was histrionic: the real thing is that we shall never see Lytton again. This is unreal. So we discuss suicide, and the ghosts as I say, change so oddly in my mind; like people who live, & are changed by what one hears of them. Now we have to see Pippa, & James & Alix. Then to Rodmell: thenâ€”perhapsâ€”to Greece with Roger & Ha. A venture that would be: & I think weâ€™re both in the mood for ventures after this morbid time; so much talk of death; & there death is of course.

We went from Cambridge on Saturday to Kings Lynn; through the lovely lonely coast that lies between that & Cromer, where I intend to go again: green meadows against the sea; & trees, & complete solitude, & now & then a line of little old houses: & Stiffkey with its hall; & some village spread out, as in a mediaeval picture, upon the rise of a dune; & lovely stubborn unknown place names; & wild roads; & Blickling, Holt, & Coke of Norfolk & Houghton; & the Pastonsâ€”all this jumble somehow shadowed by Carringtonâ€™s death: the name Partridge of course appearing on tombs & grocersâ€™ shops.
