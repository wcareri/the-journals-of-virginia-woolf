He is a rattle headed bolt eyed young man, raw boned, loose jointed who thinks himself the greatest poet of all time. I daresay he isâ€”itâ€™s not a subject that interests me enormously at the moment. What does? My own writing of course. Iâ€™ve just polished up the Leslie Sâ tephen for the Timesâ€”a good one, I think, considering the currents that sway round that subject in the Times of all papers. And I have entirely remodelled my â€˜Essayâ€™. Its to be an Essay-Novel, called the Pargitersâ€”& its to take in everything, sex, education, life &c; & come, with the most powerful & agile leaps, like a chamois across precipices from 1880 to here & nowâ€”Thats the notion anyhow, & I have been in such a haze & dream & intoxication, declaiming phrases, seeing scenes, as I walk up Southampton Row that I can hardly say I have been alive at all, since the 10th Oct. Everything is running of its own accord into the stream, as with Orlando. What has happened of course is that after abstaining from the novel of fact all these yearsâ€”since 1919â€”& Nâ ight & Dâ ay indeed, I find myself infinitely delighting in facts for a change, & in possession of quantitities beyond counting: though I feel now & then the tug to vision, but resist it. This is the true line, I am sure, after The Wavesâ€”The Pargitersâ€”this is what leads naturally on to the next stageâ€”the essay-novel. Then of course being so excited, so incandescent, I must needs fire up about Priestley & his priestliness, & write an essay, wh. L. very rightly advised against sending to the N. Statesman. So I have cellared it, against a rainy day, when I shall re-write it as an essay Middlebrow. And then all this incandescence led to the galloping horses in my heart the night before last. I lay in bed reasoning that I could not come smash. Death I defy you, &c. But it was a terrific effort, holding on to the reins. So at 2.30 I woke L. & asked, very reasonably, for ice, which he got me. And my horses calmed downâ€”he was so sensible. And I slept after a time, but Elly Rendel came yesterday & says I am putting a strain on my heart, which of course gives out, at the Ivy, or in the garden, though thereâ€™s nothing wrong; so I take this as permission not to go to parties, like Maryâ€™s at Sadlers Wells, not to do anything I dislike. And thats a great discovery. I think I shall have thus a very reasonable happy winter, writing The Pargiters, but for Gods sake, I must be careful, & go quietly, & order my litter of excitementsâ€”people like Logan & Eddy who torment me with their vanity; I must brood & chew & dream, & be entirely natural, feeling as I do for the first time that this book is important. Why do I feel this, & I never felt it in the least about the others? I have joined Pippaâ€™s Society; we dined with Pippa & she told us stories about cows & chimney pots.
