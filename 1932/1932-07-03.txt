### Sunday 3 July

Whenever I suck my pen, my lip is covered with ink. And I have no ink with which to fill my pot; & it is 10 minutes past 12; & I have just finished Hardy; & I promise myself that the C.R. will be finally done by Wednesday next. And today is Sunday. Last night at 10. the Zeppelin came past with a string of light hanging from its navel. This consoled me for not having gone to the last night of the ballet.

Now I have cleaned my table; which John inherits while Iâ€™m away. And I should now attack Ch. Rossetti. But Lord, how tired one gets of oneâ€™s own writing.
