### Monday 19 December

Yes, today, Dec. 19th, Monday, I have written myself to the verge of total extinction. Praised be I can stop & wallow in coolness & downs, & let the wheels of my mindâ€”how. I beg them to do thisâ€”cool & slow & stop altogether. I shall take up Flush again to cool myself. By Heaven, I have written 60,320 words since Oct. 11th. I think this must be far the quickest going of any of my books: comes far ahead of Orlando or The Lighthouse. But then those 60 thousand will have to be sweated & dried into 30 or 40 thousandâ€”a great grind to come. Never mind. I have secured the outline & fixed a shape for the rest. I feel, for the first time, No I mustnâ€™t take risks crossing the road, till the book is done. And though to me it is so important, I receive, at Cliveâ€™sâ€”at George, Ring the Bell & Run Awayâ€™sâ€”the first of the little pricks which will be so lavishly provided when The Pargiters comes out. Oh but by then I shall have perfected my social technique. I am practising with Eddy, & intend to make further experiments, when opportunity serves, with Logan. Yes, I will be free & entire & absolute & mistress of my life by Oct. 1st 1933. Nobody shall come here on their terms; or hale me off to them on theirs. Oh & I shall write a poets book next. This one, however, releases such a torrent of fact as I did not know I had in me. I must have been observing & collecting these 20 yearsâ€”since Jacobâ€™s Room anyhow. Such a wealth of things seen present themselves that I cant choose evenâ€”hence 60,000 words all about one paragraph. What I must do is to keep control; & not be too sarcastic; & keep the right degree of freedom & reserve. But oh how easy this writing is compared with The Waves! I wonder what the degree of carat gold is in the 2 books. Of course this is external: but thereâ€™s a good deal of goldâ€”more than Iâ€™d thoughtâ€”in externality. Anyhow, what care I for my goose feather bed? Iâ€™m off to join the raggle taggle gipsies oh! The Gipsies, I say: not Hugh Walpole & Priestleyâ€”no.

In truth The Pargiters is first cousin to Orlando, though the cousin in the flesh: Orlando taught me the trick of it. Nowâ€”oh but I must stop for 10 days at leastâ€”no 14â€”if not 21 daysâ€”now I must compose 1880-1900 chapter which needs skill. But I like applying skill I own. L. is off to the Lanchesterâ€™s in a rage. I am going to polish off my jobs: & tomorrow we go.

A very fruitful varied & I think successful autumnâ€”thanks partly to my tired heart: so I could impose terms: & I have never lived in such a race, such a dream, such a violent impulsion & compulsionâ€”scarcely seeing anything but the Pargiters.
