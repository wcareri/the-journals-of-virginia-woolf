### Saturday 12 March

So we went to Ham Sprayâ€”a lovely bright day, & got there at 1.30. â€œI thought you werenâ€™t comingâ€ said C. She came to the door, in her little jacket & socks with a twisted necklace. Her eyes were very pale. â€œI sent a telegram; but I do everything wrong. I thought you didnâ€™t get itâ€. She was pale, small, suffering silently, very calm. She had hot soup for us. I looked at the trees. We sat in the cold dining room. I didnt light the fire, she said. She had cooked us a nice hot lunch, succulent, with her own hands. We talked of Mary & Lytton. She had discovered whom Mary loves, owing to an indiscretion. But Lytton made her swear not to tell. So she didnâ€™t. We talked with effort; did she want us? Did she resent our coming to spy on her? She was bitter, laughing at Barbara. â€œShe asked how she could help. I told her to cut sandwiches. But she took an hour, talking to Tommy.â€ Then we sat on the verandah. We asked her to make us woodcuts for notepaper. And to do designs for Juliaâ€™s book. We tried to gossipâ€”about Mrs Keppel: about Saxon; she laughed once or twice: & her eyes seemed to get bluer. Then it got cold & we went & sat in Lyttonâ€™s studyâ€”all beautifully neat, his notepaper laid outâ€”a great fire; all his books exactly fitting the shelves, with the letters over them. We sat on the floor round the fire. Then L. suggested a walk. She took us to her grove. She said the trees had a flower wh. smelt very sweet in summer. She said she had some notes to write & would we go by ourselves. We only walked to the bottom of the long low down. Then L. went to do the car, & I wandered in the garden & then back into the sitting room. I was taking out a book when C. came in & asked if we would have tea before we went. She had made it. She & I went upstairs, arm in arm; & I said Let me see the view from the window. We stood looking outâ€”She said Dont you think one ought to keep a room exactly as it was? We went to Dorothy Wordsworthâ€™s house. Her room has been kept exactly as she left it. There are even the same prints & little things on the table. I want to keep Lyttonâ€™s rooms as he had them. But the Stracheys say this is morbid. Am I romantic about it dâ€™you think? Oh no, Iâ€™m romantic too, I said. And we went back to L.â€™s sitting room. She burst into tears, & I took her in my arms. She sobbed, & said she had always been a failure. â€œThere is nothing left for me to do. I did everything for Lytton. But Iâ€™ve failed in everything else. People say he was very selfish to me. But he gave me everything. I was devoted to my father. I hated my mother. Lytton was like a father to me. He taught me everything I know. He read poetry & French to me.â€ I did not want to lie to herâ€”I could not pretend that there was not truth in what she said. I said life seemed to me sometimes hopeless, useless, when I woke in the night & thought of Lyttonâ€™s death. I held her hands. Her wrists seemed very small. She seemed helpless, deserted, like some small animal left. She was very gentle; sometimes laughing; kissing me; saying Lytton had loved his old friendls best. She said he had been silly with young men. But that was only on the top. She had been angry that they had not understood how great he was. I said I had always known that. And she said I made too much of his young friends. She said Roger was â€œas Lytton said, very dim in the intellect.â€ He could never have a real intimacyâ€”it wasnâ€™t sharing everythingâ€”only Roger was very high spirited & liked going to Rome, & rather liked Lytton reading aloud to himâ€”but they couldnâ€™t talk. And this last year Lytton made up his mind to be middle aged. He was a realist. He faced the fact that Roger could not be his love. And we were going to Malaga & then he was going to write about Shakespeare. And he was going to write his memoirs, which would take him ten years. It was ironical, his dying, wasnt it. He thought he was getting better. He said things like Lear when he was ill. I wanted to take you to see him the day you came, but I was afraid toâ€”James & Pippa said one must not run any risk, & it might have upset him. â€œNo, of course notâ€ I said. â€œRoger will take the books of courseâ€”he will have to.â€ And what else did we say? There was not much time. We had tea & broken biscuits. She stood by the fireplace. Then we said we must go. She was very quiet & showed no desire for us to stay.

Then, as we were leaving the room to go she suddenly picked up a little French box with a picture of the Arc de Triomphe upon it & said â€œI gave this to Lytton. Take it. James says I mustnt give away Lyttonâ€™s things. But this is all right. I gave it him.â€ So I took it. There is a coin in it. How frightened she seemed of doing wrongâ€”like a child who has been scolded.

She came down into the front of the house. She kissed me several times. I said â€œThen you will come & see us next weekâ€”or notâ€”just as you like?â€ â€œYes, I will come, or notâ€ she said. And kissed me again, & said Goodbye. Then she went in; & turned & I waved & she waved back & she went into the house. Next morning at 8.30 the gardener heard a noise in her bedroom. He went in & found she had shot herself through the thigh. She died in 3 hours. She was conscious when Ralph & Alix & Bunny came.

(She also took me into Lyttonâ€™s bedroom. I saw his great bed; & the Anrep mosaic; his cupboard & things.)
