### Thursday 21 July

Oh but Iâ€™m so tiredâ€”I sometimes think people cant know what they do to me when they ask me to â€˜seeâ€™ them: how they hold me in the scorching light: how I dry & shrivel: how I lie awake at night longing for restâ€”this is true. But know that Iâ€™m to be pitchforked up into the light & the glare again next day. Mary yesterday; Ethel today; Adrian tomorrow: & Juâ lia Strachey, Since Monday, Nessa, Angelica: Tom & Eth Bowen; Katharine & Follett; then Adrianâ€™s suicidal face at night gave me the nightmare. And my head aches; & my back; & Iâ€™m sapped; wilted. Never mind. I shall lie in the cool at Monks House.

Alice Ritchie ringing me up about dinner, said â€œOne thing I want to say. Please dont go so far away in your next bookâ€. She had just re-read The Waves: magnificent: but loneliness almost unbearable. Mrs Hardy writes that she has often wished, after my wonderful article on Hardy, that she had asked me to write his life. Had I consented she would have given me all the materials. And how proud I was to be asked to do the T.L.S. article!

On the other hand, my poet letter passes unnoticed.
