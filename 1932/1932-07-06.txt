### Wednesday 6 July

Today is Wednesday & the CR I confess is not yet quite done. But thenâ€”well I had to re-write the last article, which I had thought so good, entirely. Not for many years shall I collect another bunch of articles. Many many people, too, & parties still to be transacted. On Sunday the Bussies; he detached ironic Gallic; she intense, worried, ineffective rather; money troubles; war loan investments vanished; theyâ€™re left with Â£80 income. But we shall go to Spain in September said Simon. Then to Angelica, passing the funeral in Epping forest; Nessa made her dress for the ballet party sitting in a field after lunch, while Quentin & Angelica wandered & L. made up an article & spoke to an old man in a hedge. Then Adrian came on Sunday night, garrulous & cheerful; talking science: then we dined with the Jamesâ€™s: Alix Red Indian: James trying to extend a feeler from his hard nut. Iâ€™m an old friend, Lyttonâ€™s friend. Will we choose books. How Carrington lied to him the night before Lytton died: said she wd not kill herself; was found unconscious in the car later. How regular your books are I said: a mere weed, he said of Eddy in Lyttonâ€™s way

These days have been very hot & very busy: books out tomorrow, Plomer, my letter & Hughâ€™s.
