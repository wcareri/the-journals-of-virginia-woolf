### Saturday 4 June

And last night we stopped the car in Hyde Park & I watched a people on the verge of ruin. How many Rolls Royces, & other low, pink, yellow, very powerful cars werent booming through the park like giant dor-beetles, with luxurious owners, men & women, lying back, on their way to some party. A Rolls Royce means Â£5000 a year. Then the children in perambulators with nurses. Then the strollers & saunterers. Then the mauve grey green trees, flushed with livid pinks & yellows; the may & the laburnum scarcely burning, like colour under water that cloudy, rainy, thunder yellow evening. So back through the West Endâ€”more cars blocked; & we on the verge of a precipice. This is written, not so much for the sake of its historical interest, as to get the taste of Madame Bolotineâ€™s memoirs out of my mouth. The influence is perceptible. Queer, the pervasiveness of bad writing. And still queerer, the fact that this emotional, unreal badly written, flimsy book is dearer to the writer than a child, has to be delivered by hand, & is the record of a tempestuous violent Russian life yet feebler than Mrs Bartholomewâ€™s memoirs.
