### Monday 1 February

Last night at Rogerâ€™s: present; ourselves, Gerald Heard, Igor. Roger rather sunk & aged after influenza. G.H. in full discourse: about the experiment made by the Yorkshireman who married 4 millions, in Devonshire.

Hâ eard. Its intensely interesting (all he says becomes dust). I went round the works with him. The Germans send a man all charges paid for a week. But the vats arenâ€™t ready. All the machinery comes from Belgium. They say itâ€™ll be delivered on a certain day: & it is. The English make excuses: always some reason why they cant deliver. He says he can keep his community supplied all except oranges & (perhaps) dates. Give him 3 months & he could supply Plymouth. Wood planting neglected in England. He buys woods aheadâ€”9 acres, 4 acres, here & there: then the fields with stumpsâ€”whats to be done? No aboriculture in Englandâ€¦.

Helen here captured me with questions, flattering, sub-acid, about my writing. And about Roger: & not seeing us; & Baba. She lies in bed & talks about Leonard: he was with the esquimaux & gnawed the shoes of the wives, & so sent for a puppyâ€”her delirium. All youth is mad, I said â€¦

Heard said something highly well informed about a Satanic picture. He is a lean starting eyed lobster man: a man of the future, without senses. In with Wells, Plunket &c: but essentially a nobody. Duncan feels this strongly. Science running thin as magnesia or quinine in his veins. Story telling about Thrings &c began & feeling his irrelevancy, for he knows all facts & no feelings, has no humour, no richness, only advanced ideas, he left. So the air became riper. Roger talked about games; children; his design for a curtain; & Nâ essa & Dâ uncan were almost too severely malicious.
