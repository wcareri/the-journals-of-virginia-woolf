### Wednesday 29 June

The room was a very sumptuous room; a wide staircase led to it; a broad hall. I was early. â€œWhat a magnificent cabinet!â€ I said to hide my nervousness, with this old charwoman in the tight dress & black stockings. All her hair has shrunk. She has the hardened, lined, drawn face of a very unhappy woman. Why, in that light she looked terrible to me. Where had the handsome Katharine gone: she who strode; had firm red cheeks; & was decisive, masterly, controlled even in the great trench of her unhappiness? Heavens, what an injury life inflicts! To have replaced that dashing youth with this almost intolerable look of suffering: a grudging look; a scraped bare look; the ugly poor woman look. By dint of arrangement, by looking through half closed eyes I could, as the evening wore on & the light faded piece together something fine: her eyes; small but penetrating; her gesturesâ€”they are still free & bold, though so much hampered by bare arms & tight ugly black & blue dress. What is fine is that she conceals nothing; has no shrinking left; has been wrung & mangled out of the softnesses & sensibilities. How white her face is, too; yet she commanded her tableâ€”her & Follettâ€™s tableâ€”with the old mastery; but as if nothing gave her any pleasure. She never relaxed. Never lost her look of suffering the whole evening. To harden to blunt to coarsen that is the worst damage ageâ€”& I daresay sheâ€™s only 8 years older than I amâ€”can inflict. Is this all Charlesâ€™ death? Or what? The talk spattered & sprinkled. A dry precise old pepperbox called Cabot, professor of Harvard, his vague wife, Mary Follett, verbose, diffuseâ€”that was the party & we sat & let the light turn grey & cold & all the cabinets grow dimâ€”all very elderly & ugly. Was that contained in my dismay with Katharineâ€”the sense I look like that too. Perhaps. Then Leonard came in, in his grey suit & blue tie, sunburnt; & I felt that we are still vigorous & young. And so kissed Katharine the old woman on the doorstep. Yes, last time we met she was driving a dogcart: & it was a cold winters day, & she was going to the docks to look at treasure.
