Athens

Yes, but what can I say about the Parthenonâ€”that my own ghost met me, the girl of 23, with all her life to come: that; & then, this is more compact & splendid & robust than I remembered. The yellow pillarsâ€”how shall I say? gathered, grouped, radiating there on the rock, against the most violent sky, with staring ice blue, & then cinder black; crowds flying as if suppliants (really Greek schoolchildren). The Temple like a ship, so vibrant, taut, sailing, though still all these ages. It is larger than I remembered, & better held together. Perhaps Iâ€™ve washed off something of the sentimentality of youth, which tends to makes things melancholy. Now Iâ€™m 50 (I signed this boldly in the hotel bookâ€”the good Yak refrainedâ€”another proof of inferiority complex), now Iâ€™m grey haired & well through with life I suppose I like the vital, the flourish in the face of death. Then thereâ€™s Athens like crumbled egg shells beneath, & the black grey bush tufted hills. â€œThe Germans come out like things hidden in a pocketâ€ I said. Sure enough, when the storm passed over, out they came, honest, perspiring unattractive people, claiming, we thought, more of the Acropolis than any other nation. We wandered; Roger said Awfully swell, awfully swell. At the Museum in the morning he said They dont compose. Thats a star fish shape. Look at the thinness of the lines: & no background. There wereâ€”& still areâ€”myriads of Greek black & red or red & black pots, each capable of inspiring a volume, & before them trail tired children, tired mothers, the oddest shabbiest raggiest housemaids & clerks, whose whole fortune has been spent on the ticket, & theyâ€™ll go home, & dominate some little suburban street on the strength of â€œI was in Athens in April 1932â€: witness the pure white marble bust after Pheidias on the mantlepiece. This is depressing in museums.

I like Athens about 7, when the streets are hurrying clamouring, flitted across by all those black whitefaced women, & shawled women, & dapper little men who come with the bats & the evening primroses in Southern towns, ari lalagos. Margery, listening to the talk at Averrov tonight said the pitch is the same as the English. She is full of reasonable & well instructed remarksâ€”as that Christ is never painted being washed; that the priests are allowed hairpins gratis, since they wear their hair long & might be tempted into effeminate ornament. This was said by the garden where all the flowers were this morningâ€”ranunculus like pink & violet shells many folded; the flapping black white specked irises. The other remark was made in the Byzantine Church at Daphni. â€œOh awfully swellâ€”better than Iâ€™d any notion ofâ€ said Roger depositing his hat stick pochard & two or three guides & dictionaries on a pillar. Then we all stared up at the white vindictive Christ, larger than a nightmare, in blue & white mosaic on the ceiling. We liked that Church very much. It is high & rugged, & arched, & the mosaic is mostly peeled. And one looks out of the door on those tufted green trees which seem each tufted with a sun lit & clouded waveâ€”so bright so dark are the green waves in the wood in which we walked. A Greek family keeps the churchâ€”middle-aged men & women, sitting in town clothes (the men) with overcoats & gold rings reading a paper at 3.30. Such idleness, such aimlessness Iâ€™ve never seen in England. At last the youngest, a woman, in shawl slippers & cotton dress, strolls off, climbs a ruined wall & begins to pick yellow flowersâ€”nothing else to do. So we drove on down to the seaâ€”& how lovely the pure lip of the sea is touching a wild shore; with hills behind, & green plains, & Eleusis in the distance & green, & red rocks, & one steamer starting.
