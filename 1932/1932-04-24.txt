### Sunday 24 April

Oh the rain, the rain! That was next day at Aegina. That lovely shelving island with the baked narrow path, the sea & the beach, the little pink & yellow houses, the thyme, the steep hillside, the Temple, skeletal, dominant, the bays flowing filled with seaâ€”all this was nothing but chill, mist, rain, Americans clustering round a thin professor; & we cowering under a pine tree which let the rain on us. Even soâ€”Roger said awfully swell; this is superbâ€”a sandstone temple better than Sunium. Marvellous what genius can do in a little spaceâ€”heres the perfectly moving proportionsâ€”& the rain drove us down to our boat as soon as we could. They had caught red fish & octopus. How? Well they put onions, bread & so on down, & the fish settle on them, then they drop a charge & pouf!â€”it goes up like that, & the fish come to the top dead, & they spear them. Its not allowed. But nobody can see you, round there. Such was the account given by the stoker with the lovely Greek smileâ€”the smile the muleteers have & the taximen. For R. & M. were mounted, & very queer they looked, jolting up the hillâ€”the polie makria hill, as the bright faced girl called it. For the people are desperately poor, & come, offering flowers, & are given the remains of lunch.

Todayâ€”how happy today wasâ€”at the little round Byzantine Church on the slopes of Hymettus. Why cant we live for ever like this, I said to myself, not that it was hot enough; but the rain blew over; & life seemed very free, & full of the good thingsâ€”wildness, thyme smelling, cypresses, the little courtyard where R. & M. sat absorbed painting; with the great marble white dog asleep in a corner, & the usual frail slippered women padding about in their swallow rooms built upstairs, with old bits of carved marble for the doorposts. I got a handful of wild anemomes & orchids. One drives the dull part & scrambles when the ruts throw us too violently backward & forward.

Talk today about Max Eastmanâ€™s book: Rogerâ€™s theories of art; & stories. M. tells stories of falling off a horse in Canada; of Julianâ€™s life; of Mrs Masefieldâ€”unintimate stories, for she has no foothold among us; & will slip off this rock into her obscure waters when we go backâ€”not that she needs us. She is punctilious about trains, & has a passion for cheeseâ€”We start tomorrow early for Nauplia, in a car.
