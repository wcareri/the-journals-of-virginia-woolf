### Thursday 19 May

John has interrupted to some purpose. All last night Nessa put his case for him & against the irascible Leonard & the hard work & the underpay. And today we have to discuss with him his â€˜feelingsâ€™â€”Iâ€™m not specially sympathetic, thinking of all the time weâ€™ve spent. And Hilda Mâ . lunches tomorrow; with a view toâ€”Oh dear, the Press, the Pressâ€”how much time it has cost us.
