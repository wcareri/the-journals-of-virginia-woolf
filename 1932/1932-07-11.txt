### Monday 11 July

I will take a new pen & a new page to record the fact which is now a fact that I have slipped a green rubber band round the Common Reader, second series, & there it lies, at 10 minutes to one, ready to take upstairs. There is no sense of glory; only of drudgery done. And yet I daresay its a nice enough book to readâ€”I doubt that I shall write another like it all the same. I must find a quicker cut into books than this. But heaven be praised, not now. Now Iâ€™m taking a holiday. That is to say, what shall I write tomorrow? I can sit down & think.
