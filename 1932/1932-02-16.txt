And I have just â€˜finishedâ€™ I use inverted commas ironically, my Donne, a great but I think well intentioned grind. And Iâ€™m fuming, slightly, over Nellyâ€™s typical servant meanness. After you said you didnâ€™t want Lottie hanging about here,â€”but I didnt say that Nellyâ€”Oh we thought thats what you meantâ€”not very nice to hang aboutâ€”you said you wouldnâ€™t have her doing thatâ€”of course I told her she must take a place at once: sheâ€™s gone to the lady at Victoriaâ€”this to revenge themselves on me: to make me feel uncomfortable. But I promptly lost my temper, a great relief, & told Nelly that this is the last time I help Lottie or interest myself in their affairsâ€”whereupon she cringes & withdraws, & says she meant nothing. Then Miss McAfee has rejected my article on Skinner, & asks for one on Q. Elizabeth instead, which she shant get; then I have to dine with Ethel Sands tonight, & must go to Bradleys to try on; & must have my hair curled. And Iâ€™m quivering & itching to write myâ€”whats it to be called?â€”â€œMen are like that?â€â€”no thats too patently feminist: the sequel then, for which I have collected enough powder to blow up St Pauls. It is to have 4 pictures. And I must go on with the C. Readerâ€”for one thing, by way of proving my credentials. To sit to Nessa; gay & debonair; to tie up parcels; to the Busch Quartet where I met Elena R. & reflected upon the transiency of human beauty, passion, & illusion; & so up to lunch.
