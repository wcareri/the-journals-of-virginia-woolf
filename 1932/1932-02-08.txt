### Monday 8 February

Why did I ever say I would produce another volume of Common Reader? It will take me week after week, month after month. However a year spentâ€”save for diversions in Greece & Russiaâ€”in reading through English literature will no doubt do good to my fictitious brain. Rest it anyhow. One day, all of a rush, fiction will burst in. These remarks are jotted down at the end of a long mornings work on Donne, which will have to be done again, & is it worth the doing? I wake in the night with the sense of being in an empty hall: Lytton dead, & those factories building. What is the point of itâ€”life, when I am not working, suddenly becomes thin, indifferent. Lytton is dead, & nothing definite to mark it. Also they write flimsy articles about him. Jack Squire for instanceâ€”as if he had not mattered very much.

And we go onâ€”at Rodmell for the week end; & went over to Caburn, & walked among those primeval downs, like a Heal bed, L. said, so comfortable: bowl shaped shadows; half circles; curves; a deep valley. Quentin last night: how mature, in some way; speaking with deliberation. Calmly explaining his situation with John. All Nessaâ€™s sense, & Cliveâ€™s shrewdness. Suddenly he asks in his drawling childish voice for books upon Italian history, for some account of some armament deal; for he is notably objective, interested in politics, in behaviourism, in psychoanalysis. This was what our talk was of. And Benita, he says, is too much afraid of me to send me her memoirs. Some reproach impliedâ€”unless this is merely the result of â€œMrs Woolfâ€™s palpitating sensibility unmatched since Sterneâ€â€”a phrase from an article on music in the M. Guardian, rather tickling my vanity.
