### Thursday 3 March

And now, Thursday 3rd March, I am rather upset because the devil whispered, all of a sudden, that I have six lectures written in Phases of Fiction; & could furbish them up & deliver the Clark lectures, & win the esteem of my sex, with a few weeks work. True, L. says since the middle 4 were published in America I could not do this without complete rewriting; & I ought therefore to dismiss the whole thing. Yet, such is the perversity of my mind, I can now think of nothing else; my mind is swarming with ideas for lectures; things I can only say in lectures; & my refusal seems lazy & cowardly. Yet two days ago I was repugnant to the thought: longed only for freedom in which to write a tap at the door; & was convinced that I should be a time serving pot hunter if I accepted. Iâ€™ve no doubt the fizz will subsideâ€”still what should I do if some friendly fellow of Trinity asked me to think it over? Soberly, I know that if I sat down to rewrite Phases of Fiction it would mean complete immersal for some weeks: I should have to re-cast, re-read: I should be impregnated with the lecturing manner: its jocosity, its emphasis; then I should be jaded by the time I approached a tap; & when I had done A tap, I should be 2 or 3 years distant from The Waves. Anyhow, Iâ€™m thankful that I wrote decidedly in the mood I was then in, before the devil whispered, & I went to my drawer & found that old MS; so well written, so full of thoughtâ€”all the work done for me. The sensible thing to do would be to talk it over quietly next week end with Dadie. Moreover, L. is definitely against it. But then Nessa & Alice Ritchie were instinctively in favour.
