Oliver to dinner last night. His cheeks are softer, fatter: he looks a codger, a card; an old buffer. I am alert now to take these signs, as if I saw us all becoming figures: rigid, inert. Well: we talked. â€œNever never have I known so odd a character as Karin. Women want children. Ray wants babies. I wont have them. Theres no money for anybody. Of course Iâ€™m oddâ€”so cold, unemotional. I havenâ€™t any feelings as a parent. I saw Ruby in Novemberâ€”after 10 years. Oh yes we shall meet. Why shouldnâ€™t we? She was a liarâ€”thats allâ€”couldnâ€™t tell the truth. But very attractive. The boy is Hunterâ€™s son. But they call him Strachey on his birth certificate. Do you know both the boys are Stracheysâ€”said Ruby. Sheâ€™s had 5 children, never by the same man. Lytton was a great man. Oh the excitement. I came back from India starved, & foundâ€”all that.â€ Lytton has left all books printed before 1841 to Senhouse. Why before 1841? â€œSome private joke I imagine. Senhouse might have preferred Â£1000. The unfortunate thing was that Lytton fell in love with Ralphâ€¦. You know what Jeans says? Civilisation is the thickness of a postage stamp on the top of Cleopatraâ€™s needle; & time to come is the thickness of postage stamps as high as Mont Blanc. Possessiveness is the devil. Inez is a little too possessive. The ideal is to cease being in love simultaneously & then it passes into another state. Nobody can be in love for more than 5 years. They cant leave Carrington alone. She says she will kill herselfâ€”quite reasonableâ€”but better to wait until the first shock is over & see. Suicide seems to me quite sensible. Weâ€™ve been born too early. Soon theyâ€™ll have found a way of curing these growths. Yesâ€”there was an autopsy. Pippa came downâ€”we had kept it from herâ€”& said Oughtnâ€™t we to have one? It had just been done. It was cancer, an early stage. Nobody guessed itâ€”nobody could have guessed itâ€”â€ This led to a long argument about doctors. Oliver is a tough old buffer: with one flame inside of him. What the Americans call â€˜cultureâ€™. â€œThats the only thing: to realise the legacy thats been left us. To read. To do nothing from 18 to 22 but read. Thats what we did. Thats why we shant grow oldâ€”we shant come to an end. But you cant do it if you dont do it then. A great man, Roger. He made things transcendentâ€”showed them lifted up. He was at Yattendonâ€”oh that was the greatest time of my life: & then there was the Aholibah; & then the Easter at Corfe: Lytton, Henry & I at one Inn; Ray Elly &â€”at another. Lytton had the mumps. Ottoline came down & stood beneath his window, & he leant out & they blew each other kisses. She used to take the stiles in one stride. â€œSuch long legsâ€ said Lytton â€œShe cant be a womanâ€. Henry was his most serious love affair. Senhouse is a very nice young manâ€”nice looking, nice mannersâ€”but no character, nothing. No Mary was rude to Inez; cut her in the street, so I cant see her. Its all a question of little Mary, nothing abstract. But I like herâ€”only not that way of lifeâ€”so absurdâ€”that fun: but I like old Jackâ€™s stories. Well I must go. Thank you, Virginia.â€
