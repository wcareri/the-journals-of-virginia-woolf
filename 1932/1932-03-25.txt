### Friday 25 March

Such is the atmosphere of days, that I thought this was Sunday, because it is Good Friday. The weather is Sunday weatherâ€”divinely good, warm, uncloudedâ€”Oh how lovely my view would be if it werenâ€™t for the grey galvanised shedsâ€”how am I to absorb them into the view? And I want to write a little story, before I go into Good Friday goose. Iâ€™m tired of my own criticismâ€”But isnâ€™t it futile to get away into that lifeâ€”where all the proportions are differentâ€”when I still have Lord knows how many brilliant articlesâ€”all cut out rounded, coloured, like magic lantern slides, to correct? An odd gulf between the one world & the other. I think Iâ€™ll go into the house & fetch my de Quincey who comes next. I am sober & desultory, cant string all my ideas on one thread. Leonard is in a pickle with Wells, & cant get hold of the facts with which to confute him. On the other hand, the dogs are thinking more & barking less, the result of my letter. One poor beast is they say â€˜tapedâ€™â€”has his mouthâ€”sealed: not altogether: barking again. A good walk might be wholesome. Percy steals the anthracite, & says didnâ€™t we hear Pinka barking all one nightâ€”a rustic attempt at mystification which fails to convince. Why is there always this relationship between master & servant?â€”Maynard says its the same in offices. Always deceit & distrust. Our Transition Age, perhaps. Perhaps we go to Sissinghurst tomorrow: there are 2 people with their house for life.
