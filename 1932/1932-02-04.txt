### Thursday 4 February

One of the curious things I am now provingâ€”now that I am going through the stages of Lyttonâ€™s deathâ€”is that for us fame has no existence. We say we cant publish Lyttonâ€™s letters for 50 years, if at all. We canâ€™t write about him. He has no funeral. I dont know where his ashes are buried. There is no commemoration any more, except when we meet & talk; or in the usual ways, alone at night, walking along the streets (but these states in my case have yet to be verified: all sensation now: I mean what Lyttonâ€™s death means I dont yet know). Hence to think of fame is superfluous: what people will say when Iâ€™m dead. The solid statue that father leftâ€”that exists no longer.

Talk yesterday with Ottoline. Philip discovered in the dining room, with its yellow cloth, reddish shades, reading letters & eating scones. Ott outâ€”selling Lawrence first editions (how Iâ€™d like to tell that to Lytton!) We discussed Dryden: P. said he can do nothing but read poetry, gets into an exalted state. I had been buying Dryden for Julian. Talk of celebrated passages. In came Ott: she had toast & tea. Talk of Bertieâ€™s autobiography, private: he devotes a chapter to abuse of her. Katherine Mansfield had disillusioned him. â€œI heard them discussing me all night through the floor.â€ She uses too much scent & powder. She had meant nothing to him. â€œThis he sends meâ€”I could only write back Et tu Brute?â€â€”Iâ€™ve had Lawrence, Aldous, Cannan, Osbertâ€”now Bertie. He replied he was astonished I should mind, but that he always hurts those he loves â€¦ So to the yellow drawing room. So to Lytton: his charm, long thin fingers, â€œtime I knew him about 1908, with Henryâ€¦ But no letters could be published. He was so considerate. I wrote to him last summerâ€”he answered with great affection, about the past. One could always count on that, though one never saw him much. Iâ€™ve asked James to send back my letters. Sprott told me he had read themâ€”I dont want them to be handed round. And do you think he was happy? with Carrington? with Senhouse?â€

So to Tom & Vivienne & the dog that makes messes: to Molly & her deafness; to The Wavesâ€”Jinny made me think of Maryâ€”& Rhoda made me cry with a vision of you. But how could you write that book? the strain, the intensityâ€”at which I kindle, as always, & say I will give her Johnsonâ€™s Lives of the Poets. And she says she is reading Eth Bowen who tries to write like me, & will L. come & meet Hodgson who breeds bull dogs; & I say I am an aristocrat in writing; & she confirms this & abuses Vita for writing about Knole, being ignobly conscious of noble blood, & I praise Vitaâ€”denounce her novels; & Philip â€˜worksâ€™ next door; & there is Ottâ€™s pug like a small Chinese lion on the chair in the hall; & Philip pops out with a copy of Drydenâ€™s poems in double columns, & I think how I would describe this to Lytton, & so home, embraced, loved perhapsâ€”anyhow hereâ€™s a letter this morning to ask me to think well of her when sheâ€™s dead. & to send her The Waves.
