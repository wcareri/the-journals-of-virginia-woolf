### Friday 22 January

Much better was much weaker. Lytton died yesterday morning.

I see him coming along the street, muffled up with his beard resting on his tie: how we should stop: his eyes glow. Now I am too numb with all the emotion yesterday to do more than think thoughts like this. Well, as I know, the pain will soon begin. One toys about with this & that. How queer it was last night at the party, the tightness round everyoneâ€™s lipsâ€”ours I mean. Duncan Nessa & I sobbing together in the studioâ€”the man looking out of the mews windowâ€”a sense of something spent, gone: that is to me so intolerable: the impoverishment: then the sudden vividness. Duncan said â€œOne misses people more & more. It comes over one suddenly that one will tell them something. Then the pang comes over one, after yearsâ€. Nessa said, What would one like if one died oneself? that the party should go on. He is the first of the people one has known since one was grown up to die she said. It was very hopeless. One knows now how irremediableâ€”but no: I cant think of any words for what I mean, & yet go on writing, numb, torpid as I am. We are going down to Rodmell this afternoon I think. Pippa & James come up today. Carrington & Ralph tomorrow. What is to happen now to Carrington? Yes, 20 years of Lytton lost to us, stupidly: the thing we shall never have again.
