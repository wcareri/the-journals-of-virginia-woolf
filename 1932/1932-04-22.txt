### Friday 22 April (as I think)

It was bitter cold. That one always forgets. The wind whistled through the uncovered sides of Giolmannâ€™s Hupmobile. L. sneezed: I shivered. All the floor was covered with painting boxes. We lunched on a table in the sun at Suniunâ€”the chalk white pillars set high like a lighthouse. The flowers all in miniature made a bright turfâ€”M. uprooted little irises. What did we say? Nothing much. After a week one talks only at dinner. And then drove home; that is through the plumed trees, by the red shaped fields, with the sudden carpets of deep red poppies, past the gipsies huts, made like wigwams out of pressed ferns; there a girl wandered spinning from a lump of sheeps wool; & women sat at the doorâ€”I thought of Piccadilly at this hour. How strange the patiently amenable flat land is, set with biblical trees, grazed by long woolled sheep, & not a house to be seen. This is England in the time of Chaucer. So at Sunium, the sea breaks upon green stone & red stone, & the slate-coloured slanting sailed ships go byâ€”all as in the time of Chaucer or Homer, not a pier, not a parade; no one looking. At Salamis the Greek Army were carrying little sacks of earth to the top of the Tomb of the dead soldiers to make it. A tuft of flowers was on the top. Oh the cold, the cold.
