### Monday 18 July

Clive & Mary last night, small, pink, underbred; not a woman of the world; without distinction; nice; rich; has lived above her means, spiritually & socially; has a little edge to her mind; tells her little story. Cliveâ€™s bad mannersâ€”how she almost married Ld Câ armarthen; might stand in a Tobacconists â€” â€” waspish; enamoured; C. bending over her cigarette case; fetching her coat (black: expensive): all this strained; incredible to spend weeks with her: no prestige attached; no glow; a little pickety, nervous, enthusiastic, hysterical dogâ€”for all the world like the little yapping dog that ran mad round the Round Pond. Nessa (next day, going to the carpet shop) says Ah yes, but think of the speed boat!
