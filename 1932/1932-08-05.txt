### Friday 5 August

Rodmell

Yesterday L. came in to my room at Breakfast & said Goldie is dead. One of those muddles apparently; he refused to tell his sister; took advice only of Morgan & Gerald Heard; was anxious to be economical; went to Guys; had an operation, secretly, a week ago; Roger saw him on Tuesday (I think) thought the little cubicle dirty; talked; supposed him to be recovering; he died suddenly that night, of an internal haemorrhage. There was no time to send for anybody. These are the dismal details of the end of that fine charming spiritâ€”so much a spirit that my thought was, anyhow he wont mind. And then, how much of a piece with our friends, like him, we are; it is thus we die, when they die. Regrets for not having had him here. He made his farewell intentionally at the dinner in June: spoke of death & not minding it. I never knew him well but had the common feeling that I have with those trusty Cambridge fellows; & was pleased, of course, by what he wrote of The Waves; & so came nearer. I get the strangest feeling now of our all being in the midst of some vast operation: of the splendour of this undertakingâ€”life: of being capable of dying: an immensity surrounds us. Noâ€”I cant get itâ€”shall let it brood itself into â€˜a novelâ€™, no doubt. (Its thus I get the conception from which the book condenses). At night L. & I talked of death again the second time this year: we may be like worms crushed by a motor car: what does the worm know of the carâ€”how it is made? There may be a reason; if so not one we, as human beings, can grasp. Goldie had some mystic belief.

And now we have been to Lewes races & seen the fat lady in black with parts of her person spilling over the shooting seat on which her bulk is so insecurely poised: seen the riff raff of sporting society all lined up in their cars with the dickies bulging with picnic baskets: heard the bark of bookies; & seen for a second the pounding straining horses with red faced jockeys lashing them pound by. What a noise they madeâ€”what a sense of muscle hard & stretchedâ€”& beyond the downs this windy sunny day looked wild & remote; & I could rethink them into uncultivated land again.

So people will go on dying until we die, Leonard said. Lytton, Carrington, Goldieâ€”all last August to be spoken toâ€”or let go, alas, because of the many times one would see them. That is one of my results: not to let friends lapse. But what can one do? One has to follow ones bentâ€”mine often to be moody, irritable, longing for solitude. I will try to write to Helen: to ask Saxon down. These are the little efforts I make against deathâ€”& am at the same time, annoyed that my clean dress hasnâ€™t come, & that Iâ€™ve re-arranged the drawing room to L.â€™s liking to my disliking.
