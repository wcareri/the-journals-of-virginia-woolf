### Monday 2 May

Well it is five minutes to ten: but where am I, writing with pen & ink? Not in my studio. In the gorge, or valley, at Delphi, under an olive tree, sitting on dry earth covered with white daisies.. L. is reading his Greek grammar beside me; there goes, I think, a swallow tail. Shelves of grey rock rise opposite me, each set with olive trees, & little bushes, & if I follow up, there comes the huge bald gray & black mountain, & then the perfectly smooth sky. And so back to the hot earth, & the flies sitting in yellow hearts of the daisies. There is a tinkling of goat bells; an old man has ridden off on his muleâ€”weâ€™re right at the bottom of the hill on top of which is Delphi, & Roger & Margery sketching. And a locust has just perched on the olive tree.

Thus I try to make visible this scene which will soon be gone forever. & perhaps too try to avoid that demon which says, perhaps so unnecessarily, that one ought to write down how we went to Corinth, Nauplia, Mycenae, to Mistra to Tripolitza, & so back to Athens, when the sun blazed, & I wore a silk dress, & we went to the gardens, & then started at 7 on Saturday morning for Delphi. I ought to write about all these places, & try perhaps to solidify some of these floating sequences that go through my mind as we drive. For the drives were very long; Oh & the wind & the sun, & how ones lips swelled & blackened & cracked & oneâ€™s nose peeled, & oneâ€™s cheeks were hot & dry as if sitting unshaded by a hot fire. All vanity has long died out. One is becoming a peasant. This reminds me of the start of joy with which I saw a tolerably well-dressed woman in the Salon at the Hotel Majestic drinking with a voluble old Greek gentleman the afternoon we came back, dry dusty red, gold, black, brown, creased, (M.â€™s wrinkles are marked like the stripes on the coat of a wild beast). After four or five days of the peasants & their solid draped beauty, the sharpness & subtlety of civilisation excite oneâ€™s upper scale of nervesâ€”the violin notes.

Greece then, so to return to Greece, is a land so ancient that it is like wandering in the fields of the moon. Life is receding (in spite of that donkey). The living, these worn down, for ever travelling the roads Greeks, cannot master Greece any longer. It is too bare too stony, precipitous for them. We met them always on the high mountain passes padding along beside their donkeys, so small, existing so painfully, always marching in search of some herb, some root, mastered by the vast distances, unable to do more than dig their heels in in the rock. Such solitude as they must know, under the sun, under the snow, such dependence on themselves to clothe & feed themselves through the splendid summer days is unthinkable in England. The centuries have left no trace. There is no 18th 16th, 15th century all in layers as in Englandâ€”nothing between them & 300 B.C. 300 B.C. somehow (dominated) conquered Greece & still holds it. So it is the country of the moon; I mean, lit by a dead sun. If one finds a bay it is deserted; so too with the hills & the valleys; not a villa, not a tea shop not a kennel anywhere; no wires, no churches, almost no graveyards.

But to be accurate, Nauplia & Mycenae lie in a rich soft prosperous plain, there are even occasional villages, where we stop & R. & M. get out their paint boxes, because the accent is there right for paintingâ€”where there is a house; for there there are aspens & cypresses & roofs to stand against the plains & the mountains.

What then happens (weâ€™ve been a walk still further into the valley which still winds itself deeper & deeper, left leaves to mark the path, coming back lost it, peeled a stick for me & here we are, having shifted, owing to the sun, higher, under the olive tree; & Iâ€™ve taken off my shoes for coolness) what then happens is that the villagers come up & begin, like friends, to talk about things in general. Last night on the hill above Delphi in the evening light with Itea beginning to flash & sparkle by the sea, one ship in the bay & the snow mountains standing out in the background, & the foreground still running rich green & red brown, where the goats & sheep were grazing, & the cars passing slowly on the winding road beneath, last night as we sat there, the goat girl came bounding up as if to rick her sheep, but it was only to talk to us. No slinking past, no tittering, no shyness. She stopped before us, as a matter of course. M. made her look through her glasses, first the right way, then the wrong. Then she told us words for things. Skotos her rough thick coat, ourands the sky, a flower lullulin my watch orologe, the carâ€”Iâ€™ve forgotten. She shouted with laughter. She was small brown, will make a shrewd broad old woman; unconstrained, friendly. Her brother came, 18, quick, shrewd, small eyed. I took his stick & water bottle. Then there was the difficulty about the coins. First she wouldnâ€™t take them or M.â€™s handkerchief: then followed us, putting her hand on her chest, asking complaining, but about what? L. repeated his gift. She took it. But not with joy. And the boy brought us a great saucepan of yaot. & so home, with the electric lights coming out; & they danced after dinner in the public house, young men, punctiliously, bowing & twisting & keeping their feet on the right spot, dressed in trousers & shirts.

halfway up. It occurs to me that the ridge seen from the top is like a badly peeled pear, when lines of peel are left on the edges.

Also that Lawrence writes his books as I write this diary in gulps & jerks: & has not the strength to come down in one blow: no welding, no shapingâ€”the result of a false anti-literariness perhaps.

Also that the male virtues are never for themselves, but to be paid for. This introduces another element into their psychologyâ€”to be paid for: what will pay. This can be sublimated but the alloy remains. (Iâ€™m thinking of the book again)
