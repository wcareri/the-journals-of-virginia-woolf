On board the Tevere, off the coast of Italy. Yes, but Iâ€™ve forgotten to get out my ink pot, & thus the splendour of these first words is committed to the gold pen.

My mindâ€”but is this to be a record of â€™my mindâ€™â€”truth is Iâ€™ve not thought of a form for this bookâ€”shall it have oneâ€”or none? I was so knife-splitting, flower expanding that morning at Victoria: I felicitated myself upon being a writer. Whatever I saw was so complex. There was a bride, dressed in the colours of the Union Jack, brand new handbag. And Helen, the full blown rose petals dewed with moisture, come to say Good bye: & the Yak that is Mâ argery Fry: for she is thick as an oak, & wears a rough white pelt, constrained by a girdleâ€”the Yak said â€œIf youâ€™d brought a dog I should have said Good bye.â€ I divined antagonism. This has developed only into a pervasive inferiority complex. Iâ€™m one of those superior beings, she thinks, who exist by virtue of their white petals; this little nervousness I vanquish by visiting her in her carriage alone, while L. & R. play chess & teach each other Greek. R. is sweet, rich, accommodating, infinitely serious, & rolls out rich Italian commands to the gondoliers, all waiting for foreigners who dont come, for no one travels this year, by the canal, at the end of St Markâ€™s. We take a gondola for one hour, & so cross to San Giorgio; & see the miraculous apse, & peer; & climb; & smooth our soles on the red yellow rosy pavement, raying out like the sea, with inlaid flowers: & Venetian light is pale & bright: the palaces, says R. pretty frauds, examples of inlay & carpentry. That old fraud Ruskinâ€”we were now in St Markâ€™s Square, looking at Adam & Eve. There are chapters about that. He was too virtuous, thats a great pity, everything had to be squaredâ€”even these finicking palaces must be morally Goodâ€”which theyre notâ€”oh noâ€”merely slices of coloured stone. Dinner at the Cavalloâ€”the old one gone bankrupt. Out after the play, in the theatre slung with green glass beads, onto the black tossing water, so silent, so swaying: & the poor people asked us not to overpay the traghetto; & there were cactuses; & a man singing in the morning; & R. & I went to the Tiepolo church; & the thick yellow service with the priests weaving a web in incantation, & the little boys & the reverence & secularity & ancientness made us say This is the magic we want: & magic there must be; so long as magic keeps its place. So on board our spacious orderly well found ship, now passing the coast of Italy.
