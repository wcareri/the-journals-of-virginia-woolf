### Wednesday 11 May

again this heroism in the attempt at pen & ink; but I am tired of reading Rousseau: it is 6 oâ€™clock; & we have just said that by this time tomorrow we shall be in Monkâ€™s House. L. will be talking to Pinka. As it is, we are shaking & rattling through Lombardy towards the Alps: & shall wake near Paris. It is a flat country set with small red houses. All is tame & rich & civilised after Greece. We went out in the rain & walked up the broad stucco streets of Belgrade yesterday: we saw nothing but very tall men in tight fitting clothes: two women in looping breeches & Turkish handkerchiefs; & so back to the train again. We saw Trieste in the same way this morning, but hot sunny, with its sea spread silky & boats & there attached ourselves to England by buying The Times. The paper reads empty & provincialâ€”these good Englishmen making such a bother about the Academy & motor cars when all the time there is Athens & the Greek islands. In kindness to my eyes now & to come I stop.
