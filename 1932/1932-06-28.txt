### Tuesday 28 June

Just â€œfinished De Quinceyâ€. Thus am I trying to keep pace with the days & deliver the 2nd C.R. done on the last of Juneâ€”which I see with dismay is Thursday. I spent last summer thus toiling over The Waves. This is less severe by a long chalk (whats the origin of that? cricket pitch? billiards?) Anyhow it blazes; swoons; the heat. Royal, imperial, are the words I fumble with in the Square. So hot yesterdayâ€”so hot, when Prince Mirsky came with his dubious fluent Russian lady: I mean she was full of temperament; had the free gestures of the Slav; but Mirsky was trap mouthed; opened & bit his remark to pieces: has yellow misplaced teeth; wrinkles his forehead; dispair, suffering, very marked on his face. Has been in England, in boarding houses for 12 years; now returns to Russia â€˜for everâ€™. I thought as I watched his eye brighten & fadeâ€”soon thereâ€™ll be a bullet through your head. Thats one of the results of war: this trapped cabinâ€™d man: but that didnt lubricate our tea.

Vita came in; then Alix; both relieved of their books (Vitaâ€™s is said to be bad) & so rather elated. Vita is driving west, alone, for 4 days today. An American has offered her Â£250 for 2,000 words; & will offer the same to me. I doubt it. Alix like a red Indian; so large boned, & with wrinkles, & sunburn like an Indians. And tonight, to my considerable alarm, at opening an entirely new door, into an entirely new room, I dine with Katharine Furse. And hereâ€™s Morgan come to lunch. So enough.
