(Derby day.) Oh dear, oh dear, I dont like dining with Cliveâ€”not altogether. It is true I conquered, at 8, my profound trepidation about my clothes. â€œI wont wear my new dress I said, in case I should be laughed atâ€. This philosophy shivered on the doorstep, when I saw two 20 horse power cars drawn up, apparently, at his door. Again I fluctuated & shivered, like a blown candle flame, when I came in & found only steamy, grubby inarticulate Rex Whistler. Why have I dressed at all I asked. Then Lord David, then Bea Howe, then Mrs Quennell. Thats all. So to dinner. And the boasting! Clive rattling out noble names. Memories of Cecils, & Godolphins: how Jack Caermarthen was engaged to Mary Baker: how the deaf duchess gondoled with the deaf Mrs Baker: but I played my tricks: jumped over the candlestick; & co operated with Clive in the great business of impressing, I think it was, Mrs Quennell. She could only remember diplomatic society in Tokio. Clive luxuriated in the Embassy at Rome. â€œLadyâ€”Iâ€™ve forgotten her name oh of course, Cynthia Grahamâ€. Then, drawing round after dinner, he put me through my paces about Eddy. And he became teasing, malicious; & he said â€œBut youâ€™ve never known anythingâ€”once you were out of your mindâ€”thatâ€™s all.â€ & he said â€œNow tell the truth. You were extremely disagreeable to Eddy .. Well, well; these little hooks only scratch the surface; & there were moments of brilliant fluency which I enjoyed; when I said its far better to be here, rubbing my wits with these charming people than reading Rousseau in my drawing room; then I revoked that opinion; then I floated again; then I landed in the scrannels. No, I dont think I like Cliveâ€™s partys anymoreâ€”though theyre stirring enough. I pick up too many thorns, one way & another. His oblique method of getting his own back always exacerbates. His ownâ€”what did I steal 20 years ago that he should never feel the debt paid? Anyhow, why not refuse the next party, & rummage on my own? My own pie is full enough: Mary, Christabel, Ld David tonight, Peter Lucas, Ethel tomorrow: &c.
