### Wednesday 13 July

I have been sleeping over a promising novel. Thats the way to write. Its a livid hot day; & Clive has been summoned to take Mary Baker to Claridgesâ€”Oh dont think me too frivolousâ€”& may I know who was comingâ€”what young ladyâ€”& weâ€™ve got Morgan insteadâ€”a change all to L.â€™s liking. Almost our last party.

Iâ€™m ruminating, as usual, how to improve my lot; & shall begin by walking, alone, in Regents Park this afternoon. What I mean is why do a single thing one doesnâ€™t want to doâ€”for instance buy a hat or read a book? Old Joseph Wright & Lizzie Wright are people I respect. Indeed I do hope the 2nd vol. will come this morning. He was a maker of dialect dixeries: he was a workhouse boyâ€”his mother went charing. And he married Miss Lea a clergymanâ€™s daughter. And Iâ€™ve just read their love letters with respect. And he said â€œAlways please yourselfâ€”then one personâ€™s happy at any rateâ€. And she said â€œmake details part of a wholeâ€”get proportions rightâ€â€”contemplating marriage with Joe. Odd how rare it is to meet people who say things that we ourselves could have said. Their attitude to life much our own. Joe a very thick sturdy manâ€”â€˜I am unique in certain respectsâ€™ he said. â€˜We must leave some record of Joe & Lizzie to posterityâ€™. Had his old working mother to Oxford. She thought All Souls would make a good Co-op. Had a fist & struck boys. His notion of learning. I sometimes would like to be learned myself. About sounds & dialects. Still what use is it? I mean, if you have that mind why not make something beautiful? Yes, but then the triumph of learning is that it leaves something done solidly for ever. Everybody knows now about dialect, owing to his dixery. He is a coarse, sturdy variety of Sidney Webb & Walter Leafâ€”stockish, hairy; more humorous & forcible than either. Could work all night, wash, & work all next day. Miss Weisse, Toveyâ€™s lady, brought them togetherâ€”made Lizzy give up arranging the flowers in the Rectory & go to Oxford. She a woman of character. Wouldnt accept Joâ€™s offer of a job because he made her feel like a bear at the end of a chain. But she married him. They were lost in the woods by Virginia Water in 1896: & sat on a seat & had an hour of great suffering, after which she accepted himâ€”they got on a bakers cart & were taken back to Miss Weisse. An absorbing story. Joe knew all about servants. Joe taught himself to read at 14; taught mill boys in a bedroom for 2d a week; a surly but very sensitive man, apparently. Now this is a testimony to Joe & Lizzy that Iâ€™ve been thinking how I should have liked to see themâ€”would now like to write to her. A fine face with bright big eyesâ€”yesâ€”but what happens in volume two?
