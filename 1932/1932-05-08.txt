### Sunday 8 May

Here it is, the last evening; very hot, very dusty. The loudspeaker is braying; L. reading, not with sympathy, Ethel Smyth; it is 2 minutes to 7 & therefore I have about 30 minutes in which to fill this book. Iâ€™ve only used 10 of my 100 nibs: my ink is still deep; how many white pages remain. This is the result of the best holiday these many years. It was so nice going off to the Post Office after our plain roll & honey; & it was so hot, & then there was always something doing. (I dont like Sundays, not even here: the little yellow cardboard looking boys are now drumming, & the dogs barking).

We went to Aegina: sun & blue gradually rolling up the mist; & L. & I found a desert bay lapped by water pale & pureâ€”noâ€”not paleâ€”but pure as some liquid jelly, laid quivering over stones, & shells, & anemones. L. went staggering out across the stones & flung himself in; I paddled. My bare feet burnt on the sand. I dried them by letting them burn a minute. And this was virgin sea. The island looked from the Temple like a south sea island with naked natives gathering to see the boats come in. M.â€”whose humanity grows & waxes, or perhaps is allowed fuller expression, became sad by the number of donkeys provided, & we only took two. Here the girls pulled my handsâ€”Ride ride they kept saying, very hot, very steep. So we pretended to shiverâ€”said riding was too cold. And the children came pressing irises & yellow poppies.

Even so, I shant fill my bookâ€”even by writing so quickly. Iâ€™ve scarcely read eitherâ€”only Rogerâ€™s Eastman, & Wells, & Murry. Oh but Iâ€™ve thought too much, about my little book. The truth is this sight seeing, this sitting, as weâ€™ve just sat, in the garden & watching the whiskered maniac against the wall laughing, as if his insanity were merely too much ripeness, & the woman with gold teeth, & the love struck boy who ate a chocolate cake, while M. painfully commiserates the poverty of the Greeks, who look anxious, she says, & the hotel keeper she says has consumptionâ€”Couldnt she give the bootblack our toastâ€”oh yes, she cant resist the little boy with a roll of peppermintsâ€”this is her suppressed, half Quaker, half virgin attitude to the worldâ€”as I was saying while I watch all this, & wonder what the hectic lady with rouged cheeks is laughing atâ€”is it my straw hat trimmed of half its brim last night, or can it be Rogerâ€™s paintboxes with which heâ€™s painfully slungâ€”as I meditate such important events, as they slip & slide & catch on the surface of my mind, Iâ€™m subterraneously sunk in scenes for my little book: make up arguments, see pictures, keep dropping something new into the cauldron, which must bubble as richly as possible before its poured & stilled & hardenedâ€”as I do this, & accept whatever suggestion the shaking cypresses & aspens, the orange flower smell, the man selling penny toys of monkeys on sticks offer me, time passes: Iâ€™m not sure if Iâ€™m in Greece or London: but think it more likely Iâ€™m in Greece, happy, easy, friendly with everything swimming easily forward. L. discussing prison reform with Marjorie, informing Roger about the break up of the atom. And then behold we come to a stop before an aviary. L. picks a tassel of grass; & the budgerigars find it & peck it to bits. On we loaf again. Its odd why khaki is used I say: & R. says thats how they see the country; then we watch a mediÃ¦val soldier in white leggings, & tufted shoes, & kilt. R. has been painting in the Parthenon, hadnâ€™t liked to ask him to sit. We spent 3 hours a day eating says M.Â M. wants to give away our food says L. & Roger runs across the road for it. These are our jokes: kindly sensitive jokes. M. is still conscious of inferiority, likes to talk of her parents & to palliate R.â€™s severity. Would like to begin life again, I think. What is lack of charm? I ask myself. Why dont these good qualities cut more ice? And whats just untied the bunch in her so that shes ineffective? Yet has every art at command; can compell yaot to breed in her house; travels; sketches; has sympathy far more widely than I have for beggars, children, state of the people. But not charm.

Then I had the vision, in Aegina, of an uncivilised, hot new season to be brought into our livesâ€”how yearly we shall come here, with a tent, escaping England, & sloughing the respectable skin; & all the tightness & formality of London; & fame, & wealth; & go back & become irresponsible, livers, existing on bread yaot, butter, eggs, say in Crete. This is to some extent a genuine impulse, I thought, coming down the hill with easy strides; London is not enough, nor Sussex either. One wants to be sunbaked, & taken back to these loquacious friendly people, simply to live, to talk, not to read & write. And then I looked up & saw the mountains across the bay, knife shaped, coloured, & the sea, brimming smooth; & felt as if a knife had scraped some incrusted organ in me, for I could not find anything lacking in that agile, athletic beauty, steeped in colour, so that it was not cold, perfectly free from vulgarity, yet; old in human life, so that every inch has its wild flower that might grow in an English garden, & the peasants are gentle people; & their clothes, worn & burnt, are subtly coloured, though coarse. Now there are sympathies between people & places, as between human beings. And I could love Greece, as an old woman, so I think, as I once loved Cornwall, as a child.

For this reason then, that we shall come back, & because L. wants to go to dinner, & I think there is a hair in my pen, I doubt that I shall make any more ceremony about coming to an endâ€”â€˜Now get ready & dont talk so muchâ€”â€™ I must end.

Still the last night, & L. playing chess still with Roger, & Iâ€™ve lain in one of those interesting torpors on my bed, with Lawrence to read, & have now woken & cant but try to fix these last minutes for L. will be in thenâ€”if I can. The Greeks, who dont dine till 9, are now at itâ€”that is are chattering, hooting, driving in the street. I hear them though our window opens on the back.

It is a fine still night. Now & then a few single words become audible. The top half of a building is cadaverous. Now the loudspeaker begins, & will so reel hoarsely through a few bars, & then suddenly stop. Everything rattles & jerks as if it were a jingling ill jointed but rapid cart.

So the days in Athens will get hotter & hotterâ€”tonight they were dining on the pavement at Costisâ€”& the nights will get noisier & gayer. I forgot to write about the Parthenon yesterdayâ€”all a glareâ€”an oblong of blue sky made oblong by white pillarsâ€”the compact rush of the Parthenonâ€”a slip of shade along the Erechtheum, in which we sat. And a loose lipped good tempered blue eyed man lounged up & said might he look at L.â€™s stick (the ringed one, bought at Sparta). So he picked at it & we said it was Greek, & he said no. It was a banana cane from Canadaâ€”had never been made in Greece. From that he went on to talk about Greek peasants. To see how they live would make you cry he said. Always working & nothing to eat but black bread so hard you cant cut it, (this with excruciated gestures) & perhaps they make a little cheese & come & sell it but there is plenty of wine always. So to the war. Everything has been wrong since then. Before the pound was stable & so was the drachma. Now one day theyre up: another down. What does sugar cost by the kilo in England? A kilo is 3 lbs: well, its cheaper in Greece. The Government protect it. But anything that comes from abroad is dearâ€”shoes, clothes. And we make hardly any flour. All this in tortured French, with the young French officer sitting beside us & his wife & sister reading a guide book. A French battle ship was in the bay, & an Italian, & soon the English would come & the sailors would walk about the town & say they had seen Greece. Indeed here came a guide leading the French sailors. Only French sailors would know the names of pediments & columns, said Roger, always in love with the French. The French would cook this better or do that better. Now the French President has been killed by a White Russian. M. pricks up her ears commiserates & reflects intelligently what effect this will have on politics. So we went to the hill which the driver called Phillipappos, all in one gulp, but it was wired off, & we therefore turned back & went on to the theatre, with its curved marble seats each cut with the name of a priest seat holder as they stick cards on the boxes at Covent Garden. One, the pawed one, the lion one, was for the priest of Dionysos, & had a carving of goats prancing & vines pendant. Here L. sat & we said that Sophocles Euripides & Aristophanes must have sat here & seenâ€”Anyhow the hills were before them, as before us. And if the 2000 years have laid a few light rubbishy stucco houses on the earth, in the way, very little has been done to damage the viewâ€”nothing solid & immense & lasting has been built. Poverty & war & misery have prevented any obliterationâ€”here or elsewhere. Indeed one might ask for more care, & more custody, not less. This afternoon the Greek raggamuffin boys were shying stones at a marble ruined arch, & pitting it, so that in some years it will be irrecoverably damaged. And the graves are nettled, tin-canned, dirty, dissolute, though the Greeks made the tombs with their own handsâ€”no the land is too exhausted even to guard its own interests any longerâ€”no doubt Lord Elginâ€™s excuse for stealing the statues from the Parthenon & the pillars from the tomb of Agamemnon at Mycenae.

Still L. plays chess & it is nearly twelve. But Athens shows no sign of sleep, so I canâ€™t complain. A howling whistling sound is made by the trams. This time tomorrow we shall be nearing Salonika: I shall be turning on my shelf, L. on his, & so for 3 nights till we reach Rodmell & sleep in our soft beds, in the cool English May:
