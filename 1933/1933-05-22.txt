### Sunday 22 May

To write to keep off sleepâ€”that is the exalted mission of tonightâ€”tonight sitting at the open window of a secondrate inn in Draguignanâ€”with plane trees outside, the usual single noted bird, the usual loudspeaker. Everyone in France motors on Sunday; then sleeps it off at night. The hotel keepers are gorged, & scarcely stop playing cards. But Grasse was too plethoricâ€”we came on here late. We leave here early. I dip into Creevey; L. into Golden Bough. We long for bed. This is the tax for travellingâ€”these sticky uncomfortable hotel nightsâ€”sitting on hard chairs under the lamp. But the seduction works as we startâ€”to Aix tomorrowâ€”so homeâ€”And â€˜homeâ€™ becomes a magnet, for I cant stop making up The P.s: cant live without that intoxicantâ€”though this is the loveliest & most distracting alternative. But Iâ€™m full of holidayâ€”& want workâ€”ungrateful that I am!â€”& yet I want the hills near Fabbria too, & the hills near Sienaâ€”but no other hillsâ€”not these black & green violent monotonous Southern hillsâ€”We saw poor Lawrenceâ€™s Phoenix picked out in coloured pebbles at Vence today, among all the fretted lace tombs.
