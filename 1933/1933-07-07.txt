### Friday 7 July

Being headachy after Pargiters & Goldsmith & ever so many people I have spent the whole morning reading old diaries, & am now (10 to 1) much refreshed. This is by way of justifying these many written books. And we have a party tonightâ€”Wests, Hutchinsons, Plomerâ€”so I need rest my head. The diary amuses me.
