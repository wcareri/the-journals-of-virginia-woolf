### Tuesday 13 June

Apostle dinner last night. Morgan on Goldie. Adrian dined with me: wine; peach fed ham; Karin with inflamed eye from tattoo; Kapp: wine; cigars; in comes Hope: lost her neck, grown stubby waxy but affable. Talk of lunch to Ott: Would she like it? Yes, they say. Mention Pipsy. And what is happening to Nan Warmington? Husband found dead in bed. And Ka. And Lottie. And Mrs Millington has hopes to inherit a fortune. Chancery opens once in 50 years.

And so on; like birds; very garrulous. The black dachshund on Hopeâ€™s knee. Has a snappy screech. Mary to call it by. Loganâ€™s malice. His version of John & the Press. Resolved to make Logan pay for this. L. comes in. Says he must go again round to James. On with our stories: father, childhood. Was he utterly bad? Had friends, A. says. Cruel, says Hope, making me walk.

I am in full flood with P.s rather think it tends to a play: anyhow am floated. L. depressed, partly because of Shaw lunch, because of Pinkaâ€™s eczema; peopleâ€”Bunny & E. Bowen tomorrow, Shaws, Bussys, Camargo; & now, instantly Bâ . Hutchinson, to ask a favour, then to hat shop & Nelly Cecil.
