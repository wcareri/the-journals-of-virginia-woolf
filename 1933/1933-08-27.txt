### Sunday 27 August

The Cartwrights werent so bad after all, though a bit of a grindâ€”two gawky girls, & Hugh, a schoolboy, with a crest worked on his coat pocket. The girls squawked a little; too genteel over their tea, which they devoured. I had had the forethought to buy sugar cakes in Lewes, where we had to go in the morning, to take Martinâ€™s garage man back; for he had brought the car, refurbished from the Alsatian. And my typewriter ribbon had gone wrong. So we went in & found Lewes in festivalâ€”the corporation fidgetting about on a doorstep covered with dull red: the local tradesmen habited in blue robes with thin strips of fur, because the troops were coming, on their economy march to Arundel. We ran into them; dirty men in shirtsleeves, marching, with the flaps of their caps let down over their necks, it was so hot. The natives of Lewes stood at the bottom of Station Street waving handkerchiefs, bobbing their umbrellas up & down. Not an inspiring sightâ€”the British army; & I disliked the credulous fat faced old women who had been dabbing their handkerchiefs in the air. But the Cartwrights had their cakes, & we played bowls. They are all 3 becoming scientists, possibly scientific chemists, science, they say being the most popular subject now, though they are doubtful about jobs. Now & again Hugh reminded me of Philip. The same green blue prominent eyes, & I thought that I detected perhaps a finer grain in him than in the others. But L. denies this. They were nice, simple, shy; why did they come, I wondered? Did Mrs C. & Mrs J. insist? We drove them over to the Sea Hotel on the front at Seaford, & I saw seaside life going on. And they seemed very young & unfittedâ€”I mean, the average, not the exception. They bathe, running down the steps of the sea hotel into the sea. A sort of beauty too. Not that I liked the couple in evening dress who passed. She was wearing a fur coat. Why dress for dinner? To show your social standing? Home, & Tarring Neville looked very lovely.

And I forgot to say that Flush has been chosen by the American Book Society. Lord!
