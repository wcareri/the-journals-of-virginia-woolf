### Saturday 7 October

no doubt true; but this morning (Saturday) cheered by Bunnyâ€™s praise. Says its a new venture; the best in proportion & so on. And today not a word about me anywhere. So thats soothing. And if tomorrow were over, Sunday Times & Observer through, I could settle in snugly. Oh & Morgan says my memoir was â€˜wonderfulâ€™; which pleases me for the light it throws on Here & Now. Perhaps I can bring off that style. And now, letters, packing, going from the lodge to the house; a damp dull day so far, but it will clear. However thereâ€™s the cement works here; so I must balance one thing with another. A very crowded gay summer in its way. Too crowded; but what happiness, coming back that night from London with L. for example: the country at midnight. And going up early; & bowls, & our solitary evenings; & cooking dinner.
