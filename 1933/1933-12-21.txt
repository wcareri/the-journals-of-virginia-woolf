I guess that my Turgenev, over which I took such tremendous pains, is not much liked. Richmondâ€™s thanks merely formal. So why go on with these essays? Why not invent a new method? Iâ€™m worried over Goldsmith. Cant be good to worry so much over transitions & packing in of ideas. But I have said this before, & say it now only because this is the relic of a morning when I should tidy, pack, write letters & so on. We lunch at Â¼ to one, & then go, this yellow cold morning. No, longer the great transition that it used to be.

Spender & Mâ aire Lynd to dinner: a free & easy night, but both notably young & at first deferential. S. has the makings of the long winded bore. Thats odd. A handsome poetic boy to look atâ€”& very ardent, & a great egotist. Lynd silent, secretive, hobble tongued. She will no doubt become a scribbler too, like her parents. Foolishly perhaps I denounced scribblers.

It struck me that a very plain narrative might be interesting. Yesterday I wrote Goldsmith all the morning; we lunched; Pinkaâ€™s eyes are bad; we walked round the Square; then I shopped in Oxford Street; went to Warings; liked the china cups: think of buying a dinner service; home at 4: L. to mother: I round to Nessaâ€™s; Angelica cutting out silver paper beasts: Duncan entertaining Bradford Corporation, was given desert service; back to dinner, read a good MS by a man called Graham; heard a Haydon symphony; bed. A fairly specimen day. Letter from Hugh Walpole.
