### Friday 20 October

Did I say I was going to write Here & Now? Not a word done. L. had influenza; so Elly says. Up & about in 2 days of course. But last night I came to the decision to stop the career of the Hogarth Press; to revert to Richmond days. What is the use of drudging & sweating & curtailing Siena & entirely obliterating all Italy England Ireland & Greece for the sake of publishing Susan Lawrence & bad novels? No. Here we stop & take a fresh courseâ€”We go to Rodmell tomorrow & I shall there broach the new scheme. Look, I cant write, cant hold a pen, all for the bother & the worry. I can only hear the pump booming. Its true I wrote the Turgenev, all yesterday till my head spun. Its true weâ€™ve had the devils own week. But to me the Press has lost its spring & balance, & could regain it if it now made a constriction to the old ideals. We might start the magazine.

Itâ€™s possible that Flush is to be pictured. Brace yesterday talked of a substantial sum. It will fall through I suppose; but for Gods sake, why make more money? I have a thousand letters to write & Hampson to readâ€”cant spin a sentence in the air, or even control my nib. So no more.

Oh & Gerald Brenanâ€™s book is unmitigated trashâ€”a sickly slab of plum cake iced with pink fly blown sugar, in spite of Bunny.
