### Monday 2 October

Yes. I had to write about the memoir Club, & Mollyâ€™s biting our hands. â€œIts torture anyhow, when one cant hear a wordâ€. Then they all came over, & we sat on the terrace; eleven people here; Julian in outline with E. Read. â€œJulianâ€™s going to teach me to thinkâ€ she said as she went. I had to scurry back to MacCarthys. Thats all over.

Its October now; & we have to go to Hastings Conference tomorrow & Wednesday, to Vita, then back to London. I opened this in order to make one of my self-admonishments previous to publishing a book. Flush will be out on Thursday & I shall be very much depressed, I think, by the kind of praise. Theyâ€™ll say its â€˜charmingâ€™ delicate, ladylike. And it will be popular. Well now I must let this slip over me without paying it any attention. I must concentrate on The Pargitersâ€”or Here & Now. I must not let myself believe that Iâ€™m simply a ladylike prattler: for one thing its not true. But theyâ€™ll all say so. And I shall very much dislike the popular success of Flush. No, I must say to myself, this is a mere wisp, a rill of water; & so create, hardly [?] fiercely, as I feel now more able to do than ever before.
