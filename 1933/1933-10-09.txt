### Monday 9 October

52 Tavistock Square

Back again & our burden is on us. Mrs Woolf yesterday; today David Cecil; tomorrow Nessa Quentin Julian lunch; Hugh Walpole tea; Thursday Vita & Mrs St. Aubynâ€”& so it begins, with Sibyl & Rosamund in the background. Iâ€™m through the Flush wave though. A small one, compared with others. Desmond praises: Morn P. tears me between the rough, coarse yellow feeble teeth of poor Mr Grigson. So its over: & if it werent for the strain of people, dentists, clothesâ€”but no: Iâ€™m going to master this. Iâ€™m going to let my self have room & verge enough. Talk of leaving London yesterday & moving the Press to Monks House: talk of buying a cottage in the North. We have plenty of money anyhow.

A soft day; have to take the car to Hendon, am writhing with Turgenev of a morning. Can I finish this week, & start Here & now next? Can I?
