### Thursday 19 January

It must be confessed that The Pargiters are like cuckoos in my nestâ€”which should be Flush. I have only 50 pages to correct & send to Mabel; & these cursed scenes & dialogues will go on springing up in my head; & after correcting one page, I sit mooning for 20 minutes. I daresay this will increase the blood pressure when I come to write. But it is a tiresome bewildering distraction now.

Then we began London briskly with Leonardâ€™s liceâ€”his incurable & disgusting skin disease. We went to a Wimpole Street specialistâ€”happily his house was almost opposite Flushâ€™s so that I could count the storeys & verify the knockersâ€”its true they have none, but the houses are very well pointedâ€”while L. & Elly were inside the consulting room. Finally the dr. said L. had never been bitten at all. And so, as the day wore on, the incurable disease was cured.

Then came Plomer & Marjorie to dine; & we went to Sadlerâ€™s Wells & saw Pomona with Nessaâ€™s designsâ€”dresses, sceneryâ€”all very pale & brightâ€”I mean Fra Angelico against a background of Cassisâ€”but dear (said to be from dieu) knows I cant keep my wits at the ballet; cant throw a ring round so many wild horsesâ€”music, dancing, decoration: & so hop on my perch, & merely make parrot noises of appreciationâ€”when, at Fitzroy Street, we all had hot sausages. Large dishes of hot, writhing sausages, looking indecent, like black snakes amorously intertwined, were handed round. There was Bunny, flushed with triumph (I sent back Pocahontas unreadâ€”cant read with my head stuffed with Pargiters) & I said I had dreamt I was in his arms, so he took me in his armsâ€”pale phantom of old loveâ€”the love of men & womenâ€”in the pantry. Roger was there,â€”is he older, less volatile? He makes his signal to Helen sooner than of old & drives off in that blind bull of a carâ€”it charges with its head downâ€”but not before, as I maliciously observed, he had cross-questioned me about his lectures. This insistent egotism has its charm. I never ask him to read my essays.

So home in the new car.
