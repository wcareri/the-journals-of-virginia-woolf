Staying with the Fishers. A queer thing, people who accept conventions. Gives them a certain force. Hâ  has the organisation behind him. But robs them of character, of vagaries, of depth, warmth, the unexpected. They spin along the grooves. H. to some extent anxious to impress his privileged impartial position. Many stories of â€œwhen I was in the Cabinetâ€. Yet why not? The odd thing is that when with them one accepts their standards. And whats wrong? So nice, just, equable, humane. But how chill! And over his shoulder I see the rulers; small; but not evil; striving,â€”a complex impression. Wardenâ s have lived there since 1370â€”or so. How can he differ? Young men all very smooth, but talkative. Nothing to strike on. A nice nameless boy told me he read Greek 8 hours daily. Some like Oxford, some think it a place of restrictions. Scatters Wilsonâ€™s son said this. Yes, Herbert accepts the current values, only rather intellectualises & refines. Dismissed Tom, Clive, Maynard (partly) in favour of the great forces of vitalityâ€”Winston, L. George. Lettice waspish about Labour Party. L.G. their trump cardâ€”their pattern man. No music in Tom. Ottoline dirty. Tells stories of Balfour & in the manner of the great manâ€”discreet, nipped, bloodless, like a butler used to the best families. Toils at history of Europe. Is an example. Do their duty by the college. Represent culture, politics, worldly wisdom gilt with letters. Nothing to whizz one off oneâ€™s perch at New College: all in good taste, & very kind. But Lord to live like that!
