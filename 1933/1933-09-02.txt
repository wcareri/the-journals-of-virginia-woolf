### Saturday 2 September

With that usual dread of asking for news on the telephone, I rang up Raymond on Thursday & heard to my extreme relief, that F.â€™s case is not so bad nearly as it seemed. The growth is small, thought to on the outside, & there seems no reason why he should not recover. I seemed to see him hauled up into the air again as R. spoke. The operation is next week. Curious how all ones fibres seem to expand & fill with air when anxiety is taken off; curious also to me the intensity of my own feelings: I think imagination, the picture making power, decks up feelings with all kinds of scenes; so that one goes on thinking, instead of localising the event. All very mysterious. But anyhow I expanded, & felt very fond of that dear old rattling milk lorry, & hoped he would see me out, & must bring myself to write to him. Partly selfishness, of course, this horror, that it means another extinction of oneâ€™s own life: brings death nearer. But let us think no more of death. Its life that matters, to quote my quotation from Montaigne.

Suddenly in the night I thought of â€œHere & Nowâ€ as a title for The Pargiters. I think it better. It shows what Iâ€™m after & does not compete with the Herries Saga, the Forsyte Saga & so on. I have now done the first part; I mean compressed it, shall, I think, compress Eleanorâ€™s day, & then what? The rest does not admit of much compression! think I have reduced it to 80,000 words perhaps; but it seems to me there must be another 40, to come. 80+40 = 120,000. If so it will be the longest of my little broodâ€”longer than Night & Day I imagine

As Percy says when he brings in the slop pail & Iâ€™m boiling the kettle â€œYouâ€™ve never had such a summerâ€. No I say, â€œits been fine since Christmasâ€ which is more or less the case. We have steadied the old ship & sail through blue days again. L. is having the new pond made, the old one re-grouted, & is going to pave the front garden. Flush, I think with some pleasure, has made these extravagances possible. We should net Â£2,000 from that six months dogged & dreary grind. What will people say of that little book I wonder, without great anxiety. Tom wrote yesterday, telling me, in his jaunty uneasy manner, to conceal his address, & the date of his visit. The mystery I imagine flatters him. But we shall see deeper into that dark well perhaps. And I have had 2 blessed days of silence. & we walked on the marsh today, & saw a drowned sheep, & were flurried by our 3 dogs. And I have decided by the way not to accept the Leslie Stephen lectureship which has not been offered me, & feel comfortably cool & obscure & anonymous. As Lytton once said, success came to us too late to make us hop on our perches.

I am reading with extreme greed a book by Vera Britain, called The Testament of Youth. Not that I much like her. A stringy metallic mind, with I suppose, the sort of taste I should dislike in real life. But her story, told in detail, without reserve, of the war, & how she lost lover & brother, & dabbled her hands in entrails, & was forever seeing the dead, & eating scraps, & sitting five on one WC, runs rapidly, vividly across my eyes. A very good book of its sort. The new sort, the hard anguished sort, that the young write; that I could never write. Nor has anyone written that kind of book before. Why now? What urgency is there on them to stand bare in public? She feels that these facts must be made known, in order to helpâ€”what? herself partly I suppose. And she has the social conscience. I have still to read how she married the infinitely dreary Catlin & found beauty & triumph in poor, gaping Holtby. But I give her credit for having lit up a long passage to me at least. I read & read & read & neglect Turgenev & Miss C. Burnett. But why does my hand shake? Why cant I write clearly?
