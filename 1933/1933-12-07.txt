### Thursday 7 December

I was walking through Leicester Sqreâ€”how far from Chinaâ€”just now when I read Death of noted Novelist on the poster. And I thought of Hugh Walpole. But it is Stella Benson. Then why write anything, immediately? I did not know her, but have a sense of those fine patient eyes: the weak voice; the cough; the sense of oppression. She sat on the terrace with me at Rodmell. And now, so quickly, it is gone, what might have been a friendship. Trusty & patient & very sincereâ€”I think of her; trying to cut through, in one of those difficult evenings, to some deeper layerâ€”certainly we could have reached it, given the chance. Iâ€™m glad I stopped her at the door as she got into her little car & asked her to call me Virginiaâ€”to write to me. And she said Thereâ€™s nothing I should like better. But its like the quenching of somethingâ€”her death out there in China; & I sitting here, & writing about her, & so fugitive, & yet so true; & no more to come. How mournful the afternoon seems, with the newspaper carts dashing up Kingsway â€œDeath of Noted Novelistâ€ on the placard. A very fine steady mind: much suffering; suppressed;â€”there seems to be some sort of reproach to me in her death, as in Kâ atherine Mâ ansfieldâ€™s. I go on; & they cease. Why? Why not my name on the posters? And I have a feeling of the protest each might make: gone with their work unfinishedâ€”each so suddenly. Stella was 41. â€œI am going to send you my book ><â€ & so on. A dreary island, she lived on, talking to Colonels.

A curious feeling: when a writer like S.B. dies, that oneâ€™s response is diminished. Here & Now wont be lit up by her: its life lessened. My effusionâ€”what I send outâ€”less porous & radiantâ€”as if the thinking stuff were a web that were fertilised only by other peoples (her that is) thinking it too: now lacks life.
