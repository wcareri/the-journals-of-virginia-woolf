### Monday 10 July

Bella arrived & knocked her head upon the window of the car. She cut her nose & was dazed. And then I was in â€˜one of my statesâ€™â€”how violent how acute & walked in Regentâ€™s Park in black misery & had to summon my cohorts in the old way to see me through, which they have done more or less. A note made to testify to my own ups & downs; many of which go unrecorded though they are less violent I think than they used to be. But how familiar it wasâ€”stamping along the road, with gloom & pain constricting my heart; & the desire for death in the old way all for two, I daresay careless words.

It seems possible that Tom has finally deserted Vivienne. Jack Hutch, came to our frosty sticky party, with the meticulous fish blooded cultivated Andrewsâ€”Rebecca merely a hard painted woman, that night, living in societyâ€”& Hutch, told us how V. has heard by cable that Tom sailed on 26th & he has not arrived. She has by today worked herself into frenzyâ€”in bed, with a nurse; & then Jack telephoned to Faberâ€”L.â€™s ideaâ€”& they say mysteriously that they cannot discuss the matter on the telephone, but if V. will pull herself together she will realise that there is no reason for anxiety. This we interpret to mean that Tom is back; has told Faber that he is parting from her; but it is kept secret, until he gives leaveâ€”which he may do today. Anyhow, V. is clearly concealing something. Jâ ack read one of Tomâ€™s last letters, & describes it as a very cold & brutal document, saying that he has made no money. I should expect that after his 6 months thought & absence he has decided to make the break here: has warned V. & provided for her. But she shuts the letters in the cupboard with the sealed string. L. is made her executor. So I go up to lunch to hear.
