### Tuesday 25 April

No, we didnâ€™t see nobody at Rodmell. Lydia & Maynard arrived before we had been there half an hour; & we dined with them, & were invited to the royal party at Shelleysâ€”Mr Hambro being the uncle of the proprietor; & the friend of Timmy & of the Gleichens; & they had crab, but the chicken was tough, so we did not go.

Thats all overâ€”our ten days: & I wrote daily, almost, at Goldsmithâ€”dont much see the point of my Goldsmiths & so onâ€”& read Goldsmith, & so on. Yes; I should now be correcting Flush proofsâ€”I doubt that little book to some extent: but Iâ€™m in a doubting mood: the scrambled mood of transience, for on Friday 5th we go to Siena; so I cant settle, & make up my story, in which lies permanence. And as usual I want to seethe myself in something newâ€”to break the mould of habit entirely, & get that escape which Italy & the sun & the lounging & the indifference of all that to all this brings about. I rise, like a bubble out of a bottle. And my eyes hurt, & I must go & see Mr Doggettâ€”Sheppardâ€™s Johnnyâ€”today. And have 7 Italian lessons; & see Vita, Christabel, &c.

But The Pargiters. I think this will be a terrific affair. I must be bold & adventurous. I want to give the whole of the present societyâ€”nothing less: facts, as well as the vision. And to combine them both. I mean, The Waves going on simultaneously with Night & Day. Is this possible? At present I have assembled 50,000 words of â€˜realâ€™ life: now in the next 50 I must somehow comment; Lord knows howâ€”while keeping the march of events. The figure of Elvira is the difficulty. She may become too dominant. She is to be seen only in relation to other things. This should give I think a great edge to both of the realitiesâ€”this contrast. At present, I think the run of events is too fluid & too free. It reads thin; but lively. How am I to get the depth without becoming static? But I like these problems, & anyhow theres a wind & a vigour in this naturalness. It should aim at immense breadth & immense intensity. It should include satire, comedy, poetry, narrative, & what form is to hold them all together? Should I bring in a play, letters, poems? I think I begin to grasp the whole. And its to end with the press of daily normal life continuing. And there are to be millions of ideas but no preachingâ€”history, politics, feminism, art, literatureâ€”in short a summing up of all I know, feel, laugh at, despise, like, admire hate & so on.
