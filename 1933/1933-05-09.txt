Juan les Pins

Yes, I thought: I will make a note of that faceâ€”the face of the woman stitching a very thin, lustrous green silk at a table in the restaurant where we lunched at Vienne. She was like fateâ€”a consummate mistress of all the arts of self preservation: hair rolled & lustrous; eyes so nonchalant; nothing could startle her; there she sat stitching her green silk with people going & coming all the time; she not looking, yet knowing, fearing nothing, expecting nothingâ€”a perfectly equipped middle class French woman.

At Carpentras last night there was the little servant girl with honest eyes, hair brushed in a flop, & one rather black tooth. I felt that life would crush her out inevitably. Perhaps 18. not more; yet on the wheel, without hope; poor, not weak but masteredâ€”yet not enough mastered but to desire furiously travel, for a moment, a car. Ah but I am not rich she said to meâ€”which her cheap little stockings & shoes showed anyhow. Oh how I envy youâ€”able to travel. You like Carpentras? But the wind blows ever so hard. Youâ€™ll come again? Thats the bell ringing. Never mind. Come over here & look at this. No, Iâ€™ve never seen anything like it. Ah yes, she always likes the English (â€˜Sheâ€™ was the other maid, with hair like some cactus in erection). Yes I always like the English she said. The odd little honest face, with the black tooth, will stay on at Carpentras I suppose: will marry? will become one of those stout black women who sit in the door knitting? No: I foretell for her some tragedy; because she had enough mind to envy us the Lanchester.
