I think I have now got to the point where I can write for 4 months straight ahead at The Pargiters. Oh the reliefâ€”the physical relief! I feel as if I cd. hardly any longer keep backâ€”that my brain is being tortured by always butting against a blank wallâ€”I mean Flush, Goldsmith, motoring through Italy: now, tomorrow, I mean to run it off. And suppose only nonsense comes? The thing is to be venturous, bold, to take every possible fence. One might introduce plays, poems, letters, dialogues: must get the round, not only the flat. Not the theory only. And conversation; argument. How to do that will be one of the problems. I mean intellectual argument in the form of art: I mean how give ordinary waking Arnold Bennett life the form of art? These are rich hard problems for my 4 months ahead. And I dont know my own gifts at the moment. Iâ€™m disoriented completely after 4 weeks holidayâ€”no 3â€”but tomorrow we go to Rodmell again. And I must fill up the chinks with readingâ€”& dont want to settle down to booksâ€”

Well, now I have to go up to Murray about my dress: & theres Ethel round the corner; but no letters; disorganisation from Whitsun again. I thought, driving through Richmond last night, something very profound about the synthesis of my being: how only writing composes it: how nothing makes a whole unless I am writing; now I have forgotten what seemed so profound. The rhododendron like coloured glass mounds at Kew. Oh the agitation, oh the discomfort of this mood.
