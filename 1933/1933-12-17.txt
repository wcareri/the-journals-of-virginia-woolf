### Sunday 17 December

I finished part 4 of Here & Now yesterdayâ€”therefore indulge in a contemplative morning. To freshen my memory of the war, I read some old diaries. How close the tears come, again & again; as I read of L. & me at the Green: our quarrels; how he crept into my bed with a little purse, & so on: how we reckoned our income & I was given tea free for a treat. The sense of all that floating away for ever down the stream, unknown for ever: queer sense of the past swallowing so much of oneself. And today we make a loop with the past by going in our grand car to see Margaret & Lilian.

Well we are very happy. Life buds & sprouts all round us: by which I mean, everybody accepts if we ask them. Joyce Wethered would â€˜adoreâ€™ to come; & on Tuesday Stephen Spender, Miss Lynd dine, & Plomer & K. Raine come inâ€”all young, all new. And Vita lunches. And tomorrow I go to tea with the Bruce Richmonds. I think we live in a rich porous earth. I think we live very fully, freely, & adventurously. In short, what we made of that strange prelude is good.

The question that now fronts me as a writer is the war chapter. That I shall leave for a few days to simmer. No doubt the brew will spout out suddenly at Rodmell. We go on Thursday. This book therefore nears its end. Too thick a book.

I dined with Clive to meet Sickert the other night. S. is sunk & old till warmed with wine. He scarcely eats. At last he expanded, & sang a French song & kissed Nessaâ€™s handâ€”spontaneously; mine more formally. I think a difficult old man probably. But the ingrained artist. Therese modest, suppliant. Laughterâ€”extravagance. How he was born in Germany, but not German. And lived at Munich till he was 8; & the German maid met the mad King who walked beside her, & she saidâ€”I forget. S. branches off. Then he went to Reading, a school kept by a drunken old woman, who beat a boy who had broken his arm. â€œAnd we 30 little wretches lay there cowed..â€ How far he wants me to write about him, I dont know. I suspect he is changeable: that he forgets. T. prompted him with words. She knows all his stories. He gets up at 5 & goes to his garage Studio at 7 & has difficulty in lighting his stove. He reads 3 papers. He wore a pilots cap with a green brim, but no overcoat, though it was freezing cold (I bought a fur coat by the way last week). He says one paintsâ€”let me seeâ€”the canvases galloped towards me. Angry with Agnew. Not a penny from that show came his way. Never again, he said. A fine Roman head, crisp hair, thick over the ears. Small dark eyes, broad forehead. â€œOh Rogerâ€™s a darlingâ€”but dear meâ€¦â€ great jokes about Roger. Had wired to Lydia not to be a fool & try to act. â€œSheâ€™s thrown away her reputation. She had a great name with the publicâ€”now sheâ€™s lost itâ€ Had lunched with the Kâ eyneseâ s. Maynard told them to listen to the WC. Sounds very audible. How she had her hour, & we must all learn to renounce, to give up: (here C. interposed one of his ring the bell sentences, about Virginia declining now from her glory & living with dogs: irritating as he meant it to be). And so we went on, a little wine-flown, but friendly & communicative, & living on our capitalâ€”I mean that we were all artistsâ€”free masonry. I cant feel very sure though of any fact or relationship; Iâ€™ve not seen him these 10 years, & then only to sing & joke. Yet heâ€™s chiselled, severe; has read: was reading Goldoni he said. & Flaubertâ€™s letters. And is Madame Bovary good? Is the Tentation good? Iâ€™m a literary painter, romanticâ€”You are the only person who understands meâ€”kissing my hand. So home in the frost to find Leon sitting with L.; & he sat & sat, propounding rather fumbling questions about literature, till at 1.45 I said I was cold, moved to the fire & heâ€”very reluctantlyâ€”went. Younger, cruder than I thought; & Iâ€™m afraid, from reading his 2nd novel in MS, not so intelligent.
