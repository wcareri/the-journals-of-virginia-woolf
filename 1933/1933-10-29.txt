### Sunday 29 October

No my head is too tired to go on with Bobby & Elviraâ€”theyre to meet at St Paulâ€™sâ€”this morning. I wish I could get it full & calm & unconscious. This last is difficult, owing to Flush, owing to the perpetual little spatter of comment that keeps me awake. Yesterday the Granta said I was now defunct. Orlando Waves Flush represent the death of a potentially great writer. This is only a rain drop; I mean the snub some little pimpled undergraduate likes to administer, just as he would put a frog in ones bed: but then thereâ€™s all the letters, & the requests for picturesâ€”so many that, foolishly perhaps, I wrote a sarcastic letter to the N.S.â€”thus procuring more rain drops. This metaphor shows how tremendously important unconsciousness is when one writes. But let me remember that fashion in literature is an inevitable thing; also that one must grow & change; also that I have, at last laid hands upon my philosophy of anonymity. My letter to the N.S. is the crude public statement of a part of it. How odd last winterâ€™s revelation was! freedom; which now I find makes it quite easy for me to refuse Sibylâ€™s invitations, to take life much more strongly & steadily. I willnot be â€˜famousâ€™ â€˜greatâ€™. I will go on adventuring, changing, opening my mind & my eyes, refusing to be stamped & stereotyped. The thing is to free ones self; to let it find its dimensions, not be impeded. And though this as usual is only a pot shot, there is a great deal of substance in it. October has been a bad month; but might have been much worse without my philosophy. Its been harassed, then L. with influenza, if only for 2 days, quickens all my insight into disaster; then Nessa away; Quentin ill; with it all, however, I have forced myself to space out these horrors.

But enough. Raymond came yesterday: Francis still very much paralysed; after 10 minutes the Raymond machine clogs; an uneasy shallow sandy mind; Eth Bowen, improving; oh & the Kingsley Martins never cease to invite us to meet Low.

Shall I now read the New Testament?

The great family dinner is tonight.

I think the pump is improved, by a letter to Bentley.
