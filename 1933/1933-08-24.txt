### Thursday 24 August

A week ago, on Friday to be precise, having got my wind again, I dipped into The Pargiters, & determined to sweat it bare of flesh before going on, accumulating more scenes. I am rearranging too, all the first part, so as to bring it together. The death happens in the first chapter now. I think I shall reduce the size by half; it is however a little bare & jerky at present. Moreover it is rather a rush & a strain. I have just killed Mrs P. & cant shoot ahead to Oxford. For the truth is these little scenes embroil one, just as in life; & one cant switch off to a different mood all in a second. It seems to me that the realness of the beginning is complete. I have a good excuse for poetry in the second part, if I can take it. Rather an interesting experimentâ€”if I could see the same thing from two different views.

And now I have spent the morning reading the Confessions of Arsene Houssaye left here yesterday by Clive. What a vast fertility of pleasure books hold for me! I went in & found the table laden with books. I looked in & sniffed them all. I could not resist carrying this one off & broaching it. I think I could happily live here & read forever.

It is true, we have many interruptions. Yesterday, after knocking against a wild Alsatian that ran into the carâ€”we gave him a great bangâ€”he lay squirmingâ€”dead, I thought, then reeled up & went galloping over the field, unhurt, though he broke our lamps & bent the mud guardâ€”after this unpleasant shock, Clive came & Julian & Frances Marshall. Clive said only one thing to hurt meâ€”how I could not take a beating at a game. That was a feeble effort, compared with what he can do in that line. Otherwise we were affable enough; & played bowls; & Fanny asked us to Ham Spray, where we may go, if we make our Western tour. Still, we see too many people, to my view: the Kingsley Martins, who are to me mentally & physically unattractive people; the sort of people George Trevelyan would have liked 25 years ago: this struck me, for their views are â€˜rightâ€™, & she is ugly stringy earnest plain. K. eats so sloppily. And they force themselves upon us. Into the bargain, I have heard from Tom, & from Peter. Tom is all artifice & quips & querks. A defence. One of these days perhaps heâ€™ll give up the trick, with marriage, or perhaps religion. All the same, our quiet days, in between times, are rightly balanced, full of peace, & possibilities. How happy, when people go, to get our dinner, & sit alone, & go to bed in my airy room, where the rising sun on the apples & asparagus wakes me, if I leave the curtain open. I am reading all Turgenev, with a view to an article; for I intend to space the arduous sections of The P.s with serene criticism. This keeps me in reading while I spin fiction. A happy day today, without visitors. Hugh Jones & the Cartwrights, alas, tomorrow.
