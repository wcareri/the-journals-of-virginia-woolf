### Wednesday 30 August

And two days ago, sitting in the garden at Charleston, Clive in his queer jerky way said he had very bad news of Francis Birrell & brought out a letter from Raymond. F. has a tumour on his brain & is to be operated on, perhaps, today. So all night I dreamt of him, my dream giving me, as my dreams often do, the essence of a relationship which in real life will never find expression. I remember sitting beside him on a sofa, & how we kissed & kissed, as friends; though in my dream I do not think that I knew he was ill. I am rather haunted by it. Think of waiting all yesterday, for an operation which may well be fatal. What should I have felt had I been him? And why was I not him? The sense of friends dying is a very terrible one.

Yesterday here was hot, baking hot; & Campbell Douglas came, 10.30: Robson 2.30. â€œCall me Willieâ€ he said at 5: at 6 Vita came; Mr Neil Lyons strolled in from the road to beg bay leaves for his pickled herrings, & a sprig of hazel since he suspects himself of being a water diviner. Vita stayed the night; we had grouse for dinner; she spent the morning talking to me; & Mary Hutchinson has just rung up to suggest a visit. Tomorrow we go to London.
