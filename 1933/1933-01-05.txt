### Thursday 5 January

I am so delighted with my own ingenuity in having after only ten years or so, made myself, in 5 minutes, a perfect writing board, with pen tray attached, so that I cant ever again fly into a fury bereft of ink & pen at the most critical moment of a writers life & see my sudden sentence dissipate itself all for lack of a pen handyâ€”& besides Iâ€™m so glad to be quit of page 100 of Flushâ€”this the third time of writing that Whitechapel scene, & I doubt if its worth it, that I cant help disporting myself on this free blue page, which thank God in heaven, needs no re-writing. It is a wet misty day: my windows out here are all fog. And I daresay we shall drive our new car, though it is still only a substitute, twenty miles or so this afternoon, by way of a test. It is like travelling first instead of third.

Bunnyâ€™s new Pochantos is reviewed in the Lit. Sup. this morning, & I augur a great success, I think without any serious pangs of jealousy. But that of course, has yet to be proved. Jealousy may slink out its green paws, being the uncertain fabric I am. But I think not, if only because Iâ€™m in sublime reading fettle: seriously I believe that the strain of The Waves weakened my concentration for monthsâ€”& then all that article compressing for the C.R. I am now at the height of my powers in that line, & have read, with close & powerful attention, some 12 or 15 books since I came here. What a joyâ€”what a sense as of a Rolls Royce engine once more purring its 70 miles an hour in my brain: so that if Bunnyâ€™s book is a good one, there will be another stretch of road ahead of me for a few days. What I hitherto have disliked in Bunny is the falsetto. Assuming a mask to speak through: out comes his own voice stylised, mincing, though well articulated & controlled. Lyttonâ€™s saying â€œYe old Cocke & Ballsâ€ of one of them sums up my meaning. I am also encouraged to read by the feeling that I am on the flood of creativeness in The Pargitersâ€”what a liberation that gives oneâ€”as if everything added to that torrentâ€”all books become fluid & swell the stream. But I daresay this is a sign only that Iâ€™m doing what is rather superficial & hasty & eager. I dont know. Iâ€™ve another week of Flush here, & then shall come to grips with my 20 years in one chapter problem. I visualise this book now as a curiously uneven time sequenceâ€”a series of great balloons, linked by straight narrow passages of narrative. I can take liberties with the representational form which I could not dare when I wrote Night & Dayâ€”a book that taught me much, bad though it may be. And now I must write to N. Darwin about her Jemmy Button. Hampsonâ€™s new novel is so bad we are going to advise against publishing it.
