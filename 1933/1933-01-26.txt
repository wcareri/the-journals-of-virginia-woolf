Well, Flush is, I swear, despatched. Nobody can say I dont take trouble with my little stories. And now, having bent my mind for 5 weeks sternly this way, I must unbend them the otherâ€”the Pargiter way. No critic ever gives full weight to the desire of the mind for change. Talk of being many sidedâ€”naturally one must go the other way. Now if I ever had the wits to go into the Shakespeare business I believe one would find the same law thereâ€”tragedy comedy, & so on. Looming behind the P.s I can just see the shape of pure poetry beckoning me. But the P.s is a delightful solid possession to be enjoyed tomorrow. How bad I shall find it.

Not a letter has come my way these 2 days (oh but several parcels) & I therefore lapse into the healing sanctuary of anonymity. I think The Beau Monde has given me upâ€”Ethel Sands is undoubtedly & no doubt reasonably annoyed with what Logan has chosen to purvey of my letters. So I say I will rout further in the bran pie; & go to my Club & meet young working women. I am going to learn Italian. Bianca my unknown adorer is to teach me. And I am to have Holtby to tea today. So perhaps I can make do without Chelsea.

I have bought several things freely & cheaply for the first time at the Winter Sales. Yesterday at Marâ shall & Snelgroveâ€™s I said, by way of a joke to the girl, If that coats rubbed, they should sell it me for Â£3. And took me seriously. I heard an acrid conversation behind a screen. The girl was a greenhorn. Youâ€™ve no right to tell customers the coat is rubbed. Thats what its reduced for & so on. To my surprise my 3.19.6â€”formerly Â£5.10 coat was given meâ€”all for my jokeâ€”for Â£3.10. Oh dearâ€”the world of shops!
