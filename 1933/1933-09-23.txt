### Saturday 23 September

This summer, I may say by way of criticism, & as a warning, has been too broken up with people. Next year I intend to be more circumspect. For the past fortnight I have lived, I say, as other people liveâ€”that is outwardly. I gave up The P.s, had reached the end of the revision; & as we had the Lucasâ€™s, Angelica & Eve, to stay, also to go to London, to dine with the Hutches, to have Morgan for the week end, & the memoir Club tonight, it seemed wise to attempt no concentration; but to participate with oneâ€™s friends. Iâ€™ve had to wedge in though, that horrid tough little article on 12th night; which being tentatively roughed out this morning I write here.

And it is a thorough wet day. The ponds are filling. L.â€™s new pond & garden are almost done, & surprisingly good, I think. The summer is put away folded up in the drawer with other summers. By Gods grace we may get 10 or 12 days without visitors before going back, but I say this not with conviction. The truth is, I like it when people actually come; but I love it when they go. It was this subconsciously that made me assume that Peter & Prudence were only staying the nightâ€”whereas he had suggested two nights. This was the cause of some embarrassment. We had to go to London soon after breakfast. She is one of the direct shorthaired terrier kind, breaking, unexpectedly, into loud barks. Why Peter, the fastidious, should commit himself for life to her, after Topsy, I cant think. A hand raised in the High or the Low would summon 20 such instantly. For life!â€”good God! I could not envisage a week of that ardent, shadeless, untidy, loveless, beautyless little woman; at 22 perhaps: but think of 32, 42, 52â€”No. He is single eyed though; paces through life between blinkers, seeing only the high road. Perhaps Prudence serves as giglamp. She works for him in libraries. They quote Greek & Latin. And he never reads a book unless he is going to write about it, she says. And so he will pen his way through lifeâ€”charming, honest, fastidious, ascetic as he is; & will leave a long trail of books behind himâ€”which I shall never read, because he writes with frozen fingers.

Old Ethel came, grown stout. And as I say, we go to Brighton today to meet Morgan, & I shall read my memoir tonight, send off my article on Monday morning, & so consider myself quit of all duties to my friends. Monday begins my holiday, my breathing space. I shall go for a long walk, I tell myself, & read Smoke in the evening, having played a game of bowls with L. And it will be a very fine day. And I shall pull open my curtains & see the stars at night. Really a marvellous spectacleâ€”all for nothing. I am reading Margotâ€”â€œV W our greatest English authoress;â€ Molly Hamilton on Webbs: & Turgenev.
