### Sunday 12 November

I ought to have made a note on Nessa & the aeroplaneâ€”last Fridayâ€”no Friday weekâ€”at Croydon. We took them there at 7. Had to be up by moonlight at 6.30. Drove across an empty delicately tinted London; lines all much marked; Croydon a great space like a green race course. We stood on the top of the roof; saw the aeroplane whirl, till the propellors were lost to sightâ€”simply evaporated: then the aeroplane takes a slow run, circles & rises. This is death I said, feeling how the human contact was completely severed. Up they went with a sublime air & disappeared like a person dying, the soul going. And we remained. I saw the plane become a little mark on the sky. A good funeral could be arranged. And I did not at all enjoy waiting for Nessa to come back across the Alps: sat making conversation with Lady Simon. So thats over.

And our visit to Francisâ€”the shaven Chinese Idol; old Birrell grown very soft & babyish, in slippers, with his shod stick beside him, apologising in an airy way for the basin & hairbrushesâ€”all very airy now, for he cant remember namesâ€”Vanessa or Virginia? & so on. Now, this minute back from the Wogans; a lovely fox red glow from beech trees; old Oxford farm houses; theirs a large, too wide, too square & cold, old house; disguised, to me unpleasantly, by Bantingâ€™s decorationsâ€”I prefer the old to the new there, unless done with more taste. But how nice, easy, mobile, affectionate, & humane it all was. We talked of Lytton & Carrington last night, Wogan sent for, 30 miles, twice one day to master Ralph, who emerged from the bushes, where he was skulking, threatening suicide. And had barricaded his door against Frances. Wogan has a shrewd worldly sense for all his patter. Said Ralph play-acted; was a lonely, but boring man; brings you tea stark naked, a bull among heifers. Theyre all naked, they all comment eternally on â€˜partsâ€™ & breastsâ€”a kind of rough parody of the old Ham Sprayâ€”Lytton acted in the kitchen. We walked this morning, but soft mist hid the hills; all was red brick Queen Anne, stately, arboreousâ€”the moment of loveliness that comes to everything over it today. Harrod to lunchâ€”a youngâ [?] man with black eyebrows & white teeth. So home to tea.
