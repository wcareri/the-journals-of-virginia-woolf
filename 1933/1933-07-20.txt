### Thursday 20 July

This was quite a correct statement of the Eliot position. He has left her â€œirrevocablyâ€; & she sits meanwhile in a flat decorated with pictures of him, & altars, & flowers. Sometimes she prevails on a strangerâ€”like E. Bowen to believe her story, at others lapses into sense. We dine with the Hutchinsons tonight, & shall I expect found some sort of Vivienne fund. It is said that there is a Convent next door to Mâ  in which she might pass her days, praying for Tom.

I am again in full flood with The P.s after a week of very scanty pages. The trouble is to get the meat pressed in: I mean to keep the rhythm & convey the meaning. It tends more & more, I thinkâ€”at any rate the Eâ lvira Mâ aggie scenesâ€”to drama. I think the next lap ought to be objective, realistic, in the manner of Jane Austen: carrying the story on all the time.

Vita dined; Nigel has appendicitis; Vita that night had slightly painted her lips, but unskilfully. Now why?
