### Thursday 6 July

Dinner at Rogerâ€™s yesterday. Company, S. Sitwells, Brennan, Oliver. All sat round about in Helenâ€™s bedroom, eating cold things off a table. I next Georgia & Roger. Talk of patent medicines. â€œAnd then I found it was an aphrodisiacâ€ G. says. She buys every patent medicine, by way of sedative. Bounds, abounds, halloos dogs on lawn: brown chocolate eyed; vital as they say not intellectual. Made the salad with cheese. Mrs Bâ renan said to be sympathetic & soft & amusing by L. The Quennells: I in my desire not to be crushing perhaps too friendly. Francis Birrell. All chatter. Stayed late. Not much satisfactionâ€”yet amusing enough, as such things are: Helenâ€™s pin points; Roger reading French poetry to Mrs Q. & Gloria â€œGloriaâ€ says Helen, on the doorstep â€œhas fallen in love with Dutuit. Caught her sighing at breakfast. My maid is going to have a child. Nonsense Gloria. Well, to tell the truth, Iâ€™m headlong in loveâ€”soâ€™s he.â€ Gaily blinking, clumsy, moleish, attractive, always jerking from thing to thing. Knows nothing. Thats what lies behind the aphrodisiac, & the bounce I suppose.

Also to sit with Georgeâ€”a solid mound in pink pyjamas: Margaret tender & solicitous; given eau de Cologne; also Rogerâ€™s show: alsoâ€”now to the London Library meeting. Two days of misery writing Goldsmith, forced respite from Pargiters.
