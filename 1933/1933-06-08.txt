### Thursday 8 June

Very well: the old Pargiters are beginning to run off: & I say oh to be done. I mean, writing is effort: writing is despair: & yet of course tâ€™other day in the grilling heat at Rodmell, I admit that the perspectiveâ€”this I think was something like my profound thought at Richmondâ€”shifts into focus: yes: the proportion is right; though I at the top suffer strain, suffer, as this morning grim despair & shall O Lord when it comes to re-writing, suffer an intensity of anguish ineffable (the word only means one cant express it); holding the thingâ€”all the thingsâ€”the innumerable thingsâ€”together.

We burst â€˜the proportionâ€™â€”Iâ€™m amused to compare the thing done with this inner oddityâ€”& went to Leonards Lee, where I saw Nelly Cecil. She escapedâ€”flying old white attenuated: I couldnt summon force to stop her. And she vanished. Violet was in the offing. So to tea in a stable with Mrs Woolf, Sylvia buying frigidaires because thereâ€™s nothing else to do; & Edgar glum, gloomy, solemn.
