### Friday 19 May

Piacenza

Its a queer thing that I write a date. Perhaps in this disoriented life one thinks, if I can say what day it is, then â€¦ Three dots to signify I dont know what I mean. But we have been driving all day from Lerici over the Apennines, & it is now cold, cloistral, highly uncomfortable in a vast galleried Italian inn, so ill provided with chairs that now at this present moment we are squatted, L. in a hard chair by his bed, I on the bed, in order to take advantage of the single light which burns between us. L. is writing directions to the Press. I am about to read Goldoni.

Lerici is hot & blue & we had a room with a balcony. There were Misses & Mothersâ€”misses who had lost all chance of life long ago, & could with a gentle frown, a frown of mild sadness, confront a whole mealâ€”arranged for the Englishâ€”in entire silence, dressed as if for cold Sunday supper in Wimbledon. Then thereâ€™s the retired Anglo-Indian, who takes shall we say Miss Toutchet for a walk, a breezy red faced man, very fond of evensong at the Abbey. She goes to the Temple; where â€˜my brotherâ€™ has rooms. Et cetera Et cetera.

Of the Apennines I have nothing to sayâ€”save that up on the top theyre like the inside of a green umbrella: spine after spine: & clouds caught on the point of the stick. And so down to Parma; hot, stony, noisy; with shops that dont keep maps; & so on along a racing road to Piacenza, at which we find ourselves now at 6 minutes to 9 P.M. This of course is the rub of travellingâ€”this is the price paid for the sweep & the freedomâ€”the dusting of our shoes & careering off tomorrowâ€”& eating our lunch on a green plot beside a deep cold stream. It will all be over this day weekâ€”comfort & discomfort; & the zest & rush that no engagements, hours, habits give. Then we shall take them up again with more than the zest of travelling.
