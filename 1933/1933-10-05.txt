### Thursday 5 October

No, I will not tackle the peculiarity of Turgenev. For one thing we are starting at 11.30 sharp for Sissinghurst; & then I spent yesterday in bed; headache; infinite weariness up my back: clouds forming in my neck; half asleep; through the rift reading Steen (author of Stallion) on Hugh Walpole. My wordâ€”how Hugh can let that rotten pear lie on his name God knows. â€œGod is Romance. God is The Character in Hugh Walâ€™s novelsâ€ & so on. And then Flush has taken his first fence, the Lit Sup, at a bound. Also to my pleasure, some obscure journalist detects no signs of whimsicality. So, though I shall get some nasty raps in the weeklies, I am sunning my wings this morning: this bright soft October morning: when the pear tree has a spatter of bright leaves; Caburn is under mist; the big pond is almost full; the little pond done; & thank Heaven, L. & I are driving off, ever so happily, through Kent. This is going to be a happy day, I say;

On Tuesday we went to Hastings; a queer experience always, that conference: a door opened into a buzzing bursting humming perfectly self dependent other world. Bevan was vociferating when we came in. But they were all marking time owing to a compromise. There are details I never get clear. When one of the tub thumpers was up, we went & sat on the balcony. The Hall is a very gay frivolous seaside hall, adapted for municipal concerts dances & so on. We sat out & had coffee on a green table, & Gillies came, & Phil Baker, & they dissected policies, again invisible to me, though Gillies threw out the remark (in deference to me, perhaps?) that he was not naturally a politician, but preferred Gardens; had been staying at Zennor: W.Â A.Â F. has a whole field of gentians &c. Phil does not truckle to the arts, for which I like him. I always think about his teeth being filed. And then the Rodentâ€”a mixture of Bob & Youngsâ€”reminiscent of my early youthâ€”a rather thin, water blooded kind of man, with hair parted & steel grey eyesâ€”& a mouth like a spinsters reticule, but of course humane, vitalised by his humanity, sufferings of negroes, son who goes to Russia, vegetarian, once every 3 weeks overcome with lust for beefâ€”ate fishâ€”he gave us lunch at Frascatiâ€™s, or some such place. I had a vast plate of beef. L. fed Pinka on the bone of his cutlet. R. in his way genial, a man of the world; a gentleman I thought as I followed him through his hotel by a secret passage out. He held himself so well. Then to the Queens Hotel where the bigwigs lodge: & then Rodent being a gentleman wished to entertain us & crooked his finger & summoned Pethick Lawrence & Mr Robertson & the lady who calls herself Mrs being in fact a Fitzroy & the friend of Mrs Walter. I talked to Pethick L.; a frost-bitten blue eyed little old man now; & he was reading Holtby on V.W. You are V.W.? Yes. I said; & then in my emotional way praised his speech that wet day at Brighton: which kindled him a little; & he told me about his wife, now speaking at Oxford about armament firms. I was enlightened & horrified; how France & Germany combine to stir up warâ€”were joint manufacturers of guns & so on. All this should be a government industry he said. I said What an argument against Capitalism! And then he had to go to the Conâ ference to hear Dalton: but we could only stand very little of Hugh; & so went out, got into the car & drove home.

The night before we went to a meeting here, in the Club, & L. broached the question of a play ground. Captain Palmer talked to meâ€”a man with one idea in his perfectly direct upright wizened tanned little being. His wife more voluptuous had been at Wye races therefore was sleepy. He had a great idea of duty to the village: called the men Back, Hubbard & so on, & thought it a disgrace that Toc H in Lewes should be asked to supply a helper to run a boys club. He was also inclined to think Mr Hancock a menace. But I must get ready now for Vita.
