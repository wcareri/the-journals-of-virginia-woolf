### Wednesday 26 July

Miss Cashin & L. doing booksâ€”â€˜89 here & 500 sheetsâ€™ & I very sleepy after dining with Julia; having tea with E. Bowen in the heatâ€”the great heat. Another unbroken wave. When I cant write of a morningâ€”as nowâ€”I try to tune myself on other books: couldnt settle on any save T. Hardyâ€™s life just now. Rather to my liking. He was unreasonable about critics, so that pale cold chicken Morgan says. And he felt bitter about the treatment of working men at Oxford; hence Jude. â€œThe Marionnetteâ€ L. is reading out to Miss Cashin. Quentin has mild pleurisy; Nessa gone down to Charleston; finds Raymond there; at Juliaâ€™s last night Wogan, â€œI think you might remainder 50 of M. L.â€â€”Dorothy Bussy, Peter Quennell: whom I dont warm toâ€”exiguous worm, rather: skinned: clever; cleverer than Wogan, whoâ€™s nicer than Peter. Talk of Memoir Club. â€œBut my autobiography would be too dirtyâ€ said PQ. They saidâ€”the youngâ€”that they had no group. Talk about Ann & Judith: Q. said he deprecated Amazons. I said I liked them till 20 or so. Q. I think is in trouble, so I guess, with his doll of a wife.* â€œMarriageâ€”â€â€”spoken very bitterly. Told me of a visit to Plaistow to correct proofs with Desmond. Coming back in the rattling tram, D. said to him how someone (he thought Molly) had proposed to him, being a good deal more in love than he was â€œ& they always feel the claws in their heart to this day.â€ Odd instance of D.â€™s spasmodic intimacy.

Oh if I could finish my Goldsmith & send it off. I must.

A great many visits: Miss Porter, James Stephen, half witted oaf, on business about Wilberforce, designed to push him on. Got out of meeting Low, at Kingsley Martins, of Mrs Maloney, American editor of the Feisâ€™s. So we go off to Monks House tomorrow, & shall write: yes: The P.â€™s must be dealt with in masterly manner. An exciting book to write.
