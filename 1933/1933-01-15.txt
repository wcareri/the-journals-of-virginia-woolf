### Sunday 15 January

I have come out here, our last morning, to write letters, so, naturally, I write this book. But then I havenâ€™t written a line these 3 weeksâ€”only typed Flush, which, Heaven be praised, I â€˜finishedâ€™, almost without inverted commas, yesterday. Ah but my writing Flush has been gradually shoved out, as by a cuckoo born in the nest, by The Pargiters. How odd the mindâ€™s functions are! About a week ago, I began the making up of scenesâ€”unconsciously: saying phrases to myself; & so, for a week, Iâ€™ve sat here, staring at the typewriter, & speaking aloud phrases of The Pargiters. This becomes more & more maddening. It will however all be run off in a few days, when I let myself write again.

I am reading Parnell. Yes; but this scene making increases the rate of my heart with uncomfortable rapidity. While I was forcing myself to do Flush my old headache came backâ€”for the first time this autumn. Why should The P.s make my heart jump, why should Flush stiffen the back of my neck? What connection has the brain with the body? Nobody in Harley St could explain, yet the symptoms are purely physical & as distinct as one book is from the other.

Meanwhile, L.â€™s hired stock has given him some form of itch. He picks what he thinks black insects off his neckâ€”I can imagine nothing more terrible than to have insects under ones skinâ€”I should see them parading in squads. Now I will try to call in my mind from The P.s, & attach it to Mr Shaw Desmond, to Tom, to Holtby, to K. Furse; but not I think to E. Smyth.

And I was forgetting to say that The Deluge Lanchester car came yesterday. It was expected at 1.15. At 3 Julian & Angelica arrived, at 4 as AJ. were going to the shop to buy sweets L. pruning, cried out its come. And it had gone. It swept up the village past us, but returned. In colour & shape it is beyond the wildest dreamsâ€”I mean it is elegant green silver beautifully compact modelled firm & not too richâ€”not a money car. We drove it to Lewes, & shall now take it to London; & so, I say, write letters. A cloudy, goose wing day with silver shields.
