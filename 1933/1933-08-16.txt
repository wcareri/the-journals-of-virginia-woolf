And owing to Sir Alan Cobhamâ€™s flying, & Angelica & Julian & fetching the boat I had another headache, & bed, & didnt see Ethel, but heard her voice & have 6 pages on the subject this morning, & didnt see the Wolves, & am out here again, nibbling at The P.s & thinking Oh Lord how am I ever going to pull all that into shape! What a tremendous struggle itâ€™ll be! Never mind. I want to discuss Form, having been reading Turgenev, (but how my hand trembles after one of these headachesâ€”cant lay hands on words or pens exactlyâ€”the habit has been broken)

Form then, is the sense that one thing follows another rightly. This is partly logic. T. wrote & re-wrote. To clear the truth of the unessential. But then D. would say that everything matters. But one cant read D. again. Now Shâ akespeare. was constrained in form by the stage (T. says one must find a new form for the old subject: but here, I suppose, uses the word differentlyâ€”) The essential thing in a scene is to be preserved. How do you know what this is? How do we know if the D. form is better or worse than the T. It seems less permanent. T.â€™s idea that you the writer states the essential & lets the reader do the rest. D. to supply the reader with every possible help & suggestion. T. reduces the possibilities.

The difficulty about criticism is that it is so superficial The writer has gone so much deeper. T. kept a diary for Bazarov: wrote everything from his point of view. We have only 250 short pages. Our criticism is only a birds eye view of the pinnacle of an iceberg. The rest under water. One might begin it in this way. The article might be more broken, less composed than usual.
