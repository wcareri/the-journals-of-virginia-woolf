Yes but of all things coming home from a holiday is undoubtedly the most damned. Never was there such aimlessness, such depression. Cant read, write or think. Theres no climax here. Comfort yes: but the coffeeâ€™s not so good as I expected. And my brain is extinctâ€”literally hasnt the power to lift a pen. What one must do is to set itâ€”my machine I meanâ€”on the rails & give it a push. Lordâ€”how I pushed yesterday to make it start running along Goldsmith again. Theres that half finished article. Lord Salisbury said something about dished up speeches being like the cold remains of last nights supper. I see white grease on the pages of my article. Today its a little warmerâ€”tepid meat: a slab of cold mutton. Its coldish, dullish here. Yes, but I hear the clock tick, & suspect, though I must not look, that the wheels are just beginning to turn on the rails. We go to Monks House for Whitsun, which is Mondayâ€”the suburban, the diminished Monks House. No, I cant look at The Pargiters. Its an empty snail shell. And Iâ€™m empty with a cold slab of a brain. Never mind. I shall dive head foremost into The Pargiters. And now I shall make my mind run along Italianâ€”whats his nameâ€”Goldoni. A few verbs I think.

It occurs to me that this state, my depressed state, is the state in which most people usually are.
