### Thursday 6 April

Oh Iâ€™m so tired! Iâ€™ve written myself out over The Pargiters this last lap. Iâ€™ve brought it down to Elvira in bedâ€”the scene Iâ€™ve had in my mind ever so many months, but I cant write it now. Its the turn of the book. It needs a great shove to swing it round on its hinges. As usual, doubts rush in. Isnt it all too quick, too thin, too surface bright? Well, Iâ€™m too jaded to crunch it up, if thats so; & so shall bury it for a monthâ€”till weâ€™re back from Italy perhaps; & write on Goldsmith &c meanwhile. Then seize on it fresh, & dash it off in June July August September. Four months should finish the first draghtâ€”100,000 words I think. 50,000 words written in 5 monthsâ€”my record

This is a time of ending. Iâ€™ve ever so many people to see. Ott tomorrow. The people of Manchester have written, very politely, with additional respect for me, because I dont take honours. And Iâ€™m going to Hugo to hear Sigrun Martyn talk Italian. Mine is hopeless. She dashes on about her carâ€”I limp & fumble. Bianca is in Italy. Nessa & the others at Charleston. Last night Lord Olivier, a jolly old bore, has been a dog in his day, dined here. And Pippa came in laterâ€”grown very thick, but looks unhappy. And we went to Bedford on Tuesday in this June weather & to St Neots & saw the carved ceiling.

I began the four great vols of Goldsmith this morning.
