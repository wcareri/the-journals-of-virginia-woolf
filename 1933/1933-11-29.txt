### Wednesday 29 November

So feebly minded after too much talkâ€”sat to Nessa, Tom to tea, Fryâ€™s to dinner. I cant make way even through the shallow waters of Sickert.

I am making a sketch of him at random. And so I thought I would make a footnote about the soul. I think Iâ€™ve got rid of vanity: of Virginia. Oh what a riddance. Iâ€™ve not read an article on me by a man called Peel in the Criterion. I feel this a great liberation. Then I need not be that self. Then I can be entirely private. I have cut the string that ties me to that quivering bag of nervesâ€”all its gratifications & acute despair. Time I did. It is another great discovery. One sees people lunging & striking at a thing like a straw horse & its not me at all. I sit back in comfort & look round. I wonder if Nessa has always been like this? It is calming. It is dignified. One does not seek uneasily for opinions on oneself. How have I come to this? Will it last? How will it work? I lie awake at night astonishingly happy sometimes. What a poem, for 10 minutes. The advantage is that it gives me a great deal to spend on L.; on reading; on doing what one likes. I wonder whether this is related to any of the famous human feelings. A rough note only which I meant to make some time ago.
