It is an utterly corrupt society I have just remarked, speaking in the person of Elvira Pargiter, & I will take nothing that it can give me &c &c: now, as Virginia Woolf, I have to writeâ€”oh dear me what a boreâ€”to the Vice Chancellor of Manchester Unâ iversity & say that I refuse to be made a Doctor of Letters. And to Lady Simon, who has been urgent in the matter, & asks us to stay. Lord knows how Iâ€™m to put Elviraâ€™s language into polite journalese. What an odd coincidence! that real life should provide precisely the situation I was writing about! I hardly know which I am, or where: Virginia or Elvira; in the Pargiters or outside. We dined with Susan Lawrence two nights ago. A Mrs Stocks of Manâ chester Uâ niversity was there. How delighted my husband will be to give you your degree in July! she began. And had rattled off a great deal about the delight of Manchester in seeing me honoured, before I had to pluck up courage & say, But I wont take it. After that there was a general argument, with the Nevinsons (Evelyn Sharp), Susan Lawrence &c. They all said they would take a degree from a University though not an honour from the state. They made me feel a little silly, priggish & perhaps extreme: but only superficially. Nothing would induce me to connive at all that humbug. Nor would it give me, even illicitly, any pleasure. I really believe that Nessa & Iâ€”she went with me, & used my arguments about the silliness of honours for womenâ€”are without the publicity sense. Now for the polite letters. Dear Vice Chancellorâ€”
