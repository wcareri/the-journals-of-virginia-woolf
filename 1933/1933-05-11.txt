Rapallo

Yesterday there was Miss Cotton. She is one of the army of spinsters, on half or quarter pay. She finds she can live at Diano Marina for 8/- a day. Her friends say But what is there to do? She says, oh there are the beauties of nature. She burst out, directly she came in to dinner, dressed in greenish dressing gown: by her side the dour Miss Thread. How was France? Was it cheap? Oh it was Liberty Hall here. Then she described the wife, the husband, of the inn: & the servants; & how there had once been an Earthquake. Meanwhile came in the 2 guests in evening dress, the deaf lady & the voluble; also the powdered white lady with the red scarf: & after dinnerâ€”they often give us asparagus, she saidâ€”& they had their own bottles of wineâ€”the two parties settled in at their own tablesâ€”where they are now & played bridge. Now this half pay spinster will dwindle on, beside the sea under the mountain, chatting, till she dies.

No we dont like the French Riviera, or the Italian much; but if it has to be, Rapallo does it best: its bay stretched with gold silk this evening, humming scented villas; all orange blossom. Quiet women reading to children, little boats, high cliffs; a sauntering indolent luxurious evening place, where one might spend ones last penny; grown old. But we dont like these villasâ€”like the Bussysâ€™â€”laid like eggs on ledges, so that you cant go up or down but must merely sit, & for ever behold the sea & the roof of the Casino. Dorothy & Janie taking their coffee like ladies in a perfectly neat, spaced, yellow room with a large leaved tree outside;â€”the tree Dorothy & Simon planted 30 years ago.

But we dont wish to live here, shredding out our days, in these scented villas, sauntering round the harbour.
