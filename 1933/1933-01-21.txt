### Saturday 21 January

Well, Flush lingers on & I cannot despatch him. Thats the sad truth. I always see something I could press tighter, or enwrap more completely. Thereâ€™s no trifling with wordsâ€”cant be done: not when theyâ€™re to stand â€˜for everâ€™. So I am battening down my Pargiters say till Wednesdayâ€”it shant be later, I swear. And now I grow doubtful of the value of those figures. Iâ€™m afraid of the didactic; perhaps it was only that spurious passion that made me rattle away before Christmas. Anyhow I enjoyed it immensely, & shall againâ€”oh to be free, in fiction, making up my scenes againâ€”however discreetly. Such is my cry this very fine cold January morning.

In 10 minutes Angelica comes & we go to Don Giovanni at Sadlerâ€™s Wells. I have seen this week besides Plomer & Marjorie, Cotter Ludby who has been found in a Police Court, strapped to a bed in St Paneras Infirmaryâ€”been raging mad, as I can believeâ€”& Robson & Ethel Smyth. Mrs Hunter is dead. Died standing eating drinking dressing penniless, ruined discredited, having got through 40,000 a year, not all of her own; but they say she was a great hostess & all is forgivenâ€”rightly I think, though in another class she would have been in prison. Such is the price we pay for our great hostesses. Witness Sibyl Colefax working in a shop.
