Yes I am readingâ€”skippingâ€”the Sacred Fount â€”about the most inappropriate of all books for this dinâ€”sitting by the open window, looking across heads & heads & headsâ€”all Siena parading in gray & pink & the cars hooting. How finely run along those involuted threads? I dontâ€”thats the answer. I let â€™em break. I only mark that the sign of a masterly writer is his power to break his mould callously. None of H.Â J.â€™s timid imitators have the vigour, once theyâ€™ve spun their sentence, to smash it. He has some native juiceâ€”figure; has driven his spoon deep into some stew of his ownâ€”some swarming mixture. Thatâ€”his vitalityâ€”his vernacularâ€”his pounce & grip & swing always spring fresh upon me, if at the same time I ask how could anyone, outside an orchis in a greenhouse, fabricate such an orchidâ€™s dream! Oh these Edwardian ladies with pale hair, these tailored â€œmy dear menâ€! Yet compared to that vulgar old brute Creeveyâ€”L. is here bitten by a fleaâ€”H.J. is muscular, lean. No doubt the society of the Regentâ€”the smell of brandy & bones, the painted velvet Lawrence womenâ€”the general laxity & lustiness & vulgarity are here at their superlative. Of course the Shelleys the Wordsworths the Coleridges existed on the other side of the hedge. But when it comes gushing out of Creeveyâ€™s page, its for all the world likeâ€”something between Buckingham Palace, Brighton; & the Queenâ€™s own italic styleâ€”so uncurbed, so weak: & how can one hope for or care for a single person? Thereâ€™s all the dreary Lords & Ladies ogling & over eating; & plush & gilt; & the Princess & the Princeâ€”I think dissolution & obesity taking hold of the 18th Century & swelling it into a puffball efflorescence, 1860 is considerably more to the point.
