Why not, one of these days, write a fantasy on the theme of Crabbe?â€”a biographical fantasyâ€”an experiment in biography?

I had so much of the most profound interest to write hereâ€”a dialogue of the soul with the soul,â€”& I have let it all slipâ€”why? Because of feeding the gold fish, of looking at the new pond, of playing bowls. Nothing remains now. I forget what It was about. Happiness. The perfect day, which was yesterday. And so on. Now I began the morning by telephoning corrections of 12th Night to the N.S., put in a comma, take out semi-colon; & so on. Then I come out here, having seen the carp, & write Turgenev.
