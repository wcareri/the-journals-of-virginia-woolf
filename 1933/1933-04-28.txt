### Friday 28 April

A mere note. We got out of the car last night & began walking down to the Serpentine. A summer evening. Chestnuts in their crinolines, bearing tapers: grey green water & so on. Suddenly L. bore off; & there was Shaw, dwindled shanks, white beard; striding along. We talked, by a railing, for 15 mins. He stood with his arms folded, very upright, leaning back; teeth gold tipped. Just come from the dentist, & â€˜luredâ€™ out for a walk by the weather. Very friendly. That is his art, to make one think he likes one. A great spurt of ideas. â€œYou forget that an aeroplane is like a carâ€”it bumpsâ€”We went over the great wallâ€”saw a little dim object in the distance. Of course the tropics are the place. The Ceylonâ  people are the original human beingsâ€”we are smudged copies. I caught the Chinese looking at us with horrorâ€”that we should be human beings! Of course the tour cost thousands; yet to see us, youâ€™d think we hadnt the price of the fare to Hampton Court. Lots of old spinsters had saved up for years to come. Oh but my publicity! Its terrifying. An hours bombardment at every port. I made the mistake of accepting invitation. I found myself on a platform with the whole university round me. They began shouting We want Bernard Shaw. So I told them that every man at 21 must be a revolutionary. After that of course the police imprisoned them by dozens. I want to write an article for the Herald pointing out what Dickens said years ago about the folly of Parliament. Oh I could only stand the voyage by writing. Iâ€™ve written 3 or 4 books. I like to give the public full weight. Books should be sold by the pound. What a nice little dog. But arenâ€™t I keeping you & making you cold (touching my arm)â€”Two men stopped along the path to look. Off he strode again on his dwindled legs. I said Shaw likes us. L. thinks he likes nobody. What will they think of Shaw in 50 years? He is 76 he said; too old for the tropics.
