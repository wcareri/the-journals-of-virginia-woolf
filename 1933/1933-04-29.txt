Last nightâ€”to relieve myself for a moment from correcting that silly book Flush,â€”oh what a waste of timeâ€”I will record Bruno Walter. He is a swarthy, fattish, man; not at all smart. Not at all the â€œgreat conductorâ€. He is a little Slav, a little Semitic. He is very nearly mad; that is, he cant get â€˜the poisonâ€™ as he called it of Hitler out of him. â€œYou must not think of the Jewsâ€ he kept on saying â€œYou must think of this awful reign of intolerance. You must think of the whole state of the world. It is terribleâ€”terrible. That this meanness, that this pettiness, should be possible! Our Germanyâ€”which I lovedâ€”with our traditionâ€”our cultureâ€”We are now a disgrace.â€ Then he told us how you cant talk above a whisper. There are spies everywhere. He had to sit in the window of his hotel in Leipzig? a whole day, telephoning. All the time soldiers were marching. They never stop marching. And on the wireless, between the turns, they play military music. Horrible horrible! He hopes for the monarchy as the only hope. He will never go back there. His orchestra had been in existence for 150 years: but it is the spirit of the whole that is awful. We must band together. We must refuse to meet any German. We must say that they are uncivilised. We will not trade with them or play with themâ€”we must make them feel themselves outcastsâ€”not by fighting them; by ignoring them. Then he swept off to music. He has the intensityâ€”genius?â€”which makes him live every thing he feels. Described conducting: must know every player.
