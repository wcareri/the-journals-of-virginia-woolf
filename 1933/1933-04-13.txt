### Thursday 13 April

No I have worked myself too dry this time. There is not one idea left in the orange. But we go today, & I shall sun, with only a few books. No I will not write; I will not see people. A little nip from Gissing in the TLS. which I must answer. But indeed I cant find wordsâ€”use the wrong onesâ€”thats my state: the familiar state after these 3 months writingâ€”what fun that book is to me! And pressing in Italian, & seeing a mint of peopleâ€”the state I say is quite familiar; & will vanish; yes, & then thereâ€™s Italy to come. I have my new corduroys; & Mr Ronald Murray is appointed my dress maker.

Sibyl lunchedâ€”one hears her dry claws tapping the perch as she hopsâ€”then Pernel, ample gentle silver grey, & veryâ€”what is the word?â€”there I go forgetting. The word I likeâ€”integrity. Now I must collect my things. Nelly by the way touchingly friendly. Age is like lichen on roofsâ€”knowing people I mean: gives our relationship some yellow red glow, so I think. Ann & Judy dined here. Ann at the stage where she likes action, rather than detective plays. Judy as candid as a boy of 10. And I want to write on Goldsmith, Halifax & Turgenev. And Ethel is â€œcutting the painterâ€ (between usâ€”for the 100th time). Andâ€”no, I must really learn a smoother narrative style.
