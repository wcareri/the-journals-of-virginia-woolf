### Thursday 23 November

Being too tired after dining with the Hutches last night to meet Michael Arlen to produce the finished article in Here & Now, perhaps I had better produce the raw. It was a real partyâ€”that is I wore my velvet dress.

But I took it in my stride. I was not much beglamoured. The drug only half worked. Eâ lizabeth Bibesco came in, a ruffle of pink feathers round her shoulders, as we were ranged on the stairs coming down. Pasty, podgy, her point the eyes, which to me seemed sadder, as if she had flung away the orange. & she talked of her daughter. And I hadâ€”oh voluminouslyâ€”all M.A.â€™s confession, as I expected. He made Â£50,000 out of the Green hat, which money he has perpetually to atone forâ€”as by talking of D.H.L., & how he escaped his influence, how he made his own life how he married his own wife, a dumb Greek called Atalanta,â€”silent, he said, but a perfect ladyâ€”& has 2 children & can keep them all, with drains games servantsâ€”all this is protest & justification. Now he is writing an intelligent novel, from real experience, lacking to highbrows. Yet oh Mrs Woolf how I envy Aldous Huxley his backgroundâ€”his education. I was at a 3rd rate public school, & lived in Earls Court. His father died of a broken heart when Roumania came into the war. A little scraping dingy porous clammy monkey faced man. My wife the Contessa Atalanta â€¦ always still justifying, but I didnt feel that need myself. Sat with Victor & Bâ . in Maryâ€™s bedroom & V. got above himselfâ€”as he will do more & moreâ€”too butcher like in his red flesh, too thick cut, underdone, assertive. â€œWe do all this sort of thing in publicâ€â€”fondling B.â€™s arm. We dont think of age, Virginia. Called me Virginia too often. â€œThe most malicious person Iâ€™ve ever metâ€. That stung a little, but not enoâ€™ to get a real rise. Talked of Dadie & Mrs Barnes. Gave a sporadic account of Dadieâ€™s fathers death & so on. Was too self assured with the Pâ rincessâ€”the handsome irresistible young man. I shall tell him some home truths. B. called out of the room. Absent 20 minutes. Thats V. on the telephone. â€œHow dare you call me conceited! We cant dine out together in future thats all â€¦ I will call you conceitedâ€”Iâ€™ll write to Virginia â€¦ You were conceitedâ€¦â€ & so on: always bickering. He brought her a bandbox full of the Rothschild rubies, worth Â£300,000 so that they cant be insuredâ€”a crown that glows & drips red light. He said there was a book in the box. No, I dont altogether like that. So home at last, leaving Eth at 44.
