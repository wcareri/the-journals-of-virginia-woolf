### Saturday 12 August

So naturally after Mrs Nef I was so tiredâ€”I shivered & shook. I went to bed for 2 days & slept I daresay 7 hours, visiting the silent realms again. It strikes meâ€”what are these sudden fits of complete exhaustion? I come in here to write: cant even finish a sentence; & am pulled under; now is this some odd effort; the sub-conscious pulling me down into her? Iâ€™ve been reading Faber on Newman; compared his account of a nervous breakdown; the refusal of some part of the mechanism; is that what happens to me? Not quite. Because Iâ€™m not evading anything. I long to write The Pargiters. No. I think the effort to live in 2 spheres: the novel; & life is a strain; Nefsâ€™s almost break me, because they strain me so far from the other world; I only want walking & perfectly spontaneous childish life with L. & the accustomed when Iâ€™m writing at full tilt: to have to behave with circumspection & decision to strangers wrenches me into another region; hence the collapse.

Still, Saturday, I cant focus; am disoriented; sleepy; physically tired, but quite calm; the dear old repetitions soothe me again: L.; Pinka; dinner; tea; papers; music; I have a dread of â€˜seeingâ€™ people: increase this in anticipation: but what I dread is the wrench to another sphere.
