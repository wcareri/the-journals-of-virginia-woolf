### Sunday 10 September

To begin with another question (just read the last pages) why am I sitting here at 10.30 on a Sunday morning, rather stiff in the back, rather sore of the lips, writing diary, not novel? Because of dear old Tom largely. 24 hours (short interval for sleep) solid conversation, preluded by 2 hours flimsy conversation with the Hutchinsons. And at 1.30 Rosamond & Wogan to lunch; & at 4.30 Charleston to tea. Hence I am sitting here. Tomorrow, in the divine peace of Monday, I shall walk on the downs & think of Tom & my parched lips with some degree of pleasure. Yes, it was worth it, though when a second day seemed on the cards my tongue fainted & my heart stood still. He is 10 years younger: hard, spry, a glorified boy scout in shorts & yellow shirt. He is enjoying himself very much. He is tight & shiny as a wood louse (I am not writing for publication). But there is well water in him, cold & pure. Yes I like talking to Tom. But his wing sweeps curved & scimitar like round to the centre himself. Heâ€™s settling in with some severity to being a great man. Keats wasnâ€™t that. We talked about Keatsâ€™s letters. Tom said that letter writing was a form he preferred to Times leader writing. I think this hints some change in his views. He said that he no longer thought felt quite so sure of a science of criticism. He also said that people exaggerate the intellectuality & erudition of his poetry. â€œFor example Ross Williamson in his book on me â€¦ He says that very seriously. I couldnt quote Holtby with the same candour. Ross apparently attributed the dog, in Tomâ€™s quotation from Webster, to profound associations with the dog star. Not a bit of it says Tom: I was having a joke about Webster. I connect all this with his bubbling up of life. At 46 he wants to live, to love; even seeing Rochester is an event to him. He has seen nothing, nobody, for the last 10 years. We had it out about V. at breakfast. Some asperity on Tomâ€™s part. He wont admit the excuse of insanity for herâ€”thinks she puts it on; tries to take herself in; for this reason, mystifies Eth Bowen. I thought him a little resentful of all the past waste & exaction. I gather he will see a good deal of us: & if I had time, & if I could move the heavy stone of his self esteem an inch or two higher, I should like to talk out to Tom about writing. Only thereâ€™s always the reservationâ€”I cant talk about â€œmy writingâ€; so that talk about his writing pallsâ . But I am to find him 2 rooms in Somers Town. And we agreed about the infamy of teaching English; the idiocy of lectures; the whole hierarchy of professor, system & so on: at any rate I got him to go some way with me in denouncing Oxford & Cambridge. He learnt (1) self confidence at Oxford; (2) how to write plain Englishâ€”thats all. I daresay though he will become Prof. of Poetry at Oxford one of these days.

His father was a brick merchant in St Louis; & they lived in the slums among vacant lots. & his father always gave away money; & died, alas, in 1919 before Tom had becomeâ€”well, happily his mother lived to see him what she called (& I daresay Tom too) a great man. What a queer naÃ¯ve vanity all this is! But of course, when you are thrown like an assegai into the hide of the worldâ€”this may be a definition of geniusâ€”there you stick; & Tom sticks. To shut out, to concentrateâ€”that is perhapsâ€”perhapsâ€”one of the necessary conditions. And now it is close on eleven; the bells are tolling; the leaves are very bright on pear tree & apple tree; & I think I shall dawdle over letters & booksâ€”I must read 12th night for Lydiaâ€™s extortion (an article on her appearance) & so drowse as quietly as possible till we have to talk incessantly till 8 oâ€™clockâ€”& then O Lordâ€”quiet, dine alone, & sleep in my airy room; & no talk tomorrow or tomorrow.

(why not write a bookâ€”of Crâ iticsm in this style?)
