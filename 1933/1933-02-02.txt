### Thursday 2 February

No we are not deserted by the worldâ€”oh dear no: dinner Mary Monday; dinner here Friday; James & Alix dinner Wednesdayâ€”to talk about Lyttonâ€™s things, says James. â€œI want to see you both aloneâ€. Hope, will you come to dinner again? Ethel, will you lunch at Woking; Margaret West to tea on Sundayâ€”a possible Press manager (Sâ .Jâ . to go) & Bianca to tea today: on top of which we have to decide about 35 Gordon Square on Saturday. By chance, Martins sent us an order; we saw it; well, it might doâ€”Its a great big corner house; a warren of a basement; a studio, a bad dining room & kitchen; but great rooms looking on to the square; & quiet, with gardens behind; with a side door, so that publishing is possibleâ€”they say: altogether, I expect we shall take it for 9 years, at much the same rent as this, & the Pritchards will share. Not that I much want a move in March, with The Pargiters on my hands. I am going however to work largely, spaciously, fruitfully on that book. Today I finishedâ€”rather more completely than usualâ€”revising the first chapter. Iâ€™m leaving out the interchaptersâ€”compacting them in the text; & project an appendix of dates. A good idea?

And Galsworthy died two days ago, it suddenly struck me, walking just now by the Serpentine after calling on Mrs Wâ . (whoâ€™s been dyingâ€”is recovering) with the gulls opening their scimitarsâ€”masses of gulls. Galsworthyâ€™s dead: & A. Bennett told me he simply couldnâ€™t stick Galsworthy. Had to praise Jackâ€™s books to Mrs G. But I could say what I liked against Galsworthy. That stark man lies dead.
