This should be all descriptionâ€”I mean of the little pointed green hills; & the white oxen, & the poplars, & the cypresses, & the sculptured shaped infinitely musical, flushed green land from here to Abbaziaâ€”that is where we went today; & couldnâ€™t find it, & asked one after another of the charming tired peasants, but none had been 4 miles beyond their range, until we came to the stone breaker, & he knew.

The hills go pale blue, washed very sharp & soft on the sky; hill after hill;
