### Tuesday 3 January

This is a little out of place, but then so am I. We are up for Angelicaâ€™s party last night, & I have half an hour to spend before shooting in the new Lanchester (not oursâ€”one lent) back to Rodmell. We have been there just short of one fortnight, & I ate myself into the heart of print & solitudeâ€”so as to adumbrate a headache. And to wipe off the intensity of concentrationâ€”trying to re-write that abominable dog Flush in 13 days, so as to be freeâ€”oh heavenly freedomâ€”to write The Pargiters,â€”I insisted upon a night of chatter. Let me see.

I fell into the arms of Nan & Ethelâ€”the two discreet ladies. Nan had a banana brown mask; Ethel the head of a Parisian cocotte. I like masks. I like the disorientation they give my feelings (here I lapsed for 5 minutes into Elviraâ€™s thoughts about civilisationâ€”indeed, its a good discipline, this new one, of forcing oneâ€™s brain the other way for a timeâ€”see how vigorously it spurts backâ€”) Then I was settled with Nan; & she poor woman, tried to conciliate the powers which were then in the ascendant & said she â€œinfinitely preferred this to the Beau Monde. Oh how much hungrier I am for this meal than for my own dinner! Yes, Virginia, Iâ€™m a bohemian at heart. I have just slipped into the other. There is a certain charm in it. But our Butler is the most Bohemian of all. And then dear Ethelâ€”â€ Now stop, I said, youâ€™re going to celebrate the perfections of Ethel. I cant allow that. For I assure you, Ethelâ€™s humanity is mere superficialityâ€”â€œOh my dear, I assure you youâ€™re wrong. She has a very subtle sense of societyâ€”I havenâ€™t. She gets things from Ldy Oxford for instance, that I dont. If she has a fault it is that she never sees anyones faults, which tends of course to make themâ€”I mean, its a little lacking in salt, that is to meâ€. While this ambling & pacing went onâ€”I always whip myself up to say something entire I give myself that creditâ€”but its often very silly & something Iâ€™ve said beforeâ€”Ethel was sitting by us, on the models throne talking to Raymond. And we were eating ham & chicken & ices & rolls & pate sandwichesâ€”& drinking wineâ€”Nessaâ€™s commissariat was lavish & opportuneâ€”I daresay there were 60â€”or 40â€”people there. Wogan drifted up. We talked. I was very polite, because of John. He was very polite. Rosamund I thought a little chillâ€”no, shy I daresay. Wogan said The Waves shd. be filmed: I in my vague way, said V. Isham wants to do itâ€”but she meant to broadcast, & oddly enough, when I came home I found a letter from her saying so. Then Wâ ogan. talked about the autumnal Ottoline calling Râ osamond to her upstairs & leaving him to hear Dryden read by Pipsey Philip Morrell: to walk in the garden & get advice about trees & pagodas. W. lives a littleâ€”but lives joyously, & I daresay wantonlyâ€”in the shadow of R. who, modest I think, is yet a best seller; an American successâ€”a musical, rapt girl or woman: too easily content though with familiar melodies. Wogan wears well cut trousersâ€”was a sporting manâ€”& a red jersey to symbolise that he is now disowned by his father, a painter. R. later got into-talk with L. about John; & was vague, grieved, apologetic, yet sisterly. Couldnâ€™t, I think, put up much defense. And dear old Marjorie performed. My word! she is now an elderly fat womanâ€”grey as a badger, but so stout, so pendulousâ€”so much an old fireside matron for all her witch waysâ€”which are in truth obscene with her peculiar touch of genius in being blatantly obscene. She has few, black, crooked (so it seemed to me) teeth. She opens her mouth, grimaces, claws, paws, stumps, projects, hawks, pirouettesâ€”should have been on the stageâ€”a Marie Lloyd. And Cory, up for his Bohemian night & determined to be Bohemian as he signified by saying in a loud voice under the lee of Nan â€œMy family call him the Arch-Buggerâ€â€”Cory was much taken by her, & stretching a long arm I pulled one strand of her hair, & introduced them. She gets moth eaten, she says, in the country: seemed to feel it damp, clayey; is driven in on herself; reads too much; cant escape; has no one to rub up withâ€”yetâ€”Wogan saidâ€”is the life & soul of Leicester: plays games with the hunting setâ€”according to him the most barbarous of all people. Children come down with blood on their foreheads for 3 days after a hunt: mustnâ€™t wash it off. Then there was Saxon bowing & smiling in silence like a Chinese mandarinâ€”so I bowed & smiled in silence swaying off my throne to him. â€œWe know each other so well, we smile nowâ€ I said, reflecting that I should ask him to dinner; but I doubt if he wants it.

(my 30 minutes is stretching.) L. is talking to Miss Johnson, who wonâ€™t do. And last night Belsher rang up to say her fur coat was stolen: might she borrow one from me: so up she came, & accused Miss Johnsonâ€™s protege an unemployed man who is allowed in; significant of the relations between Miss J. & B.â€”strained. The coat was worth Â£30, Miss B. said: too poor to buy another: & this morning she rings up to say she is ill, & so is all her family. What then about Porter? I wonderâ€”that strapping American? Oh the future of the Pressâ€”for the millionth time it is melting again.

I daresay this will be my last appearance in this book, because I think I have destroyed this pen, tired my hand, & nothing but thin water comes from my brain, having written so much, so quickly. It is 12.35 on Tuesday January 3rd 1933.
