### Friday 17 February

I steal time from my Italian verbs. Yes I think I know them. I am having 2 lessons weekly from Bianca; she suggests three; but as I have to get in Ethel &c. Oh yesterday it was like being a snail shell & having a thrush tapping till the beak of her incessant voice broke my skull. I always say â€œPoor old ladyâ€. For I rather think she came all the way from Woking for this dry brittle hour. I am half ashamedâ€”yet cant see that Iâ€™m to blame. And now she goes to Bath for 5 weeksâ€”yes, to my relief I own. Because I cant bear being a snail shell. And she is so positive, so insistent. Being Ethel is so habitual to her.

Iâ€™m launched again in The Pargiters, in this blank season of the yearâ€”Nessa at Charleston, Clive in Jamaica, Roger in Tangierâ€”Vita in Americaâ€”which of my friends is left. But Desmond dined the night before last; Morgan came in last night; Holtby todayâ€”so thereâ€™s no lack of people. Now of course the P.s runs a little slack. This fact recording is too flat.
