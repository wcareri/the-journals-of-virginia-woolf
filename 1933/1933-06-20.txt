### Tuesday 20 June

Its a very ugly thing, a ceremony. I detest them more & more. This refers to my waste of a morning at the WCG Jubilee today. Margaret & Lilian, in grey blue, & coffee colourâ€”how characteristic!â€”presented a banner. M.â€™s white hair, tied with black bow, wears thin. Their shoulders hunch a little. Otherwise I noted little change. The great hall full. The women all in pinks & blues. Fine old housekeepers; of the Sophie type; massive; determined. Now & then a great laugh; & very queer accents. Mrs Jones of Brighton pronounced twenty different ways. But all was ceremony. Margaret Bondfield: Susan Lawrenceâ€”& so on: the bigwigs: & they say things that arent true: they say we are on the brink of a new world; they talk of the triumph of coâ -operation. Thats why I hate ceremoniesâ€”not a word that fitsâ€”all wind blown, gaseous, with elementary emotions. Years ago I got something out of the mere conglomeration, the stir, the multitude. But today, I was not annihilated, dispersed; I said to myself The P.s is more real, truer harder, more veined with blood than all this, & longed to be back, working. How odd to spend a morning merely vacant, regardant!â€”How many I spend concentrated! Then we shook, & smiled with others intervening Margaretâ€™s, Lilianâ€™s hands: emotions not extreme; & found a back way out. I must now read Wainwrights, a possible East End novel. I am in flood again with The P.s.
