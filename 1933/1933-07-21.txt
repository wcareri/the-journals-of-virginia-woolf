### Friday 21 July

Dinner at the Hutchinsons last night; in the garden, though there might have been a shower. Very cloudy, sultry & completely still. The white cat came out & played about. Mary in white, like a mummy; with a yellow turban, hanging down: chalk white face, like a pierrot. I said I would put her in The Pargiters. She might come in the last scene, or going to a party. Like a little horse. We were much more natural & easy than usual. Lobster & cutlets in aspic. We talked of the Eliots a little; then of Bâ . & Victor: how both Desmond & I said he was jealous. Then the lights began to flicker on the faces of the houses & on the trees. Mary became rather restless & said would we like to go to the Zoo. We might meet people there, she said. She wanted to go. Jack not much, nor I not much. But we went. And we met Simon & two frenchmen, Masson the ballet maker, in the reptile house. Mary twined the heavy scaly pythons round her: they have bright electric blue bloom on them. They feel like muscles moving under a shiny plated skin; L. took one & it wound itself round his head like a toque, sticking its head out & flicking its tongue at the side. So to the white bears, the ~~polar bears~~ sea lions; & looked at the brilliant green showering trees, with sleepy birds pecking about on the grass.

Vivi. Eâ  said of the scene with Tom at the solicitors: he sat near me & I held his hand, but he never looked at me.
