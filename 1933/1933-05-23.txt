### Tuesday 23 May

I have just said to myself if it were possible to write, those white sheets would be the very thing, not too large or too small. But I do not wish to write, except as an irritant. This is the position. I sit on L.â€™s bed; he in the only armchair. People tap up & down on the pavement. This is Vienne, it is roasting hotâ€”hotter & hotter it getsâ€”& we are driving through France; & its Tuesday & we cross on Friday & this strange interval of travel of sweeping away from habitations & habits will be over. On & on we goâ€”through Aix, through Avignon, on & on, under arches of leaves, over bare sandy roads, under grey black hills with castles, beside vines: & Iâ€™m thinking of The Pargiters; & L. is driving; & when we come to poplars, we get out & lunch by the river; & then on; & take a cup of tea by the river, fetch our letters, learn that Lady Cynthia Mosley is dead; picture the scene; wonder at death; & drowse & doze in the heat, & decide to sleep hereâ€”hotel de la Poste; & read another letter, & learn that the Book Society will probably take Flush, & speculate what we shall do if we have 1,000 or Â£2,000 to spend. And what would these little burghers of Vienne, who are drinking coffee do, with that sum, I ask? The girl is a typist; the young men clerks. For some reason they start discussing hotels at Lyons, I think; & they havent a penny piece between them; & all the men go into the urinal, one sees their legs; & the Morocco soldiers go in their great cloaks; & the children play ball, & people stand lounging, & everything becomes highly pictorial, composed, legs, in particularâ€”the odd angles they make, & the people dining in the hotel; & the queer air it all has, since we shall leave early tomorrow, of something designing Vienne on my mind, significantly. Now the draw of home, & freedom, & no packing tells on usâ€”oh to sit in an arm chair, & read & not to have to ask for Eau Minerale with which to brush our teeth!
