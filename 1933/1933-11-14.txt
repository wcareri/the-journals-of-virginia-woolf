### Tuesday 14 November

And I have precisely 3 minutes before tea to say that Jacqueline Stiven has taken up a great deal of time & inspired a great deal of ingenuity by sending a passage from A R of Ones O to the Statesman. L. was positive it was a hoax. But I have now been in touch with Mrs Miles Reid & Mrs Stiven the Syrianâ€”names that will mean nothing to me in a years time. We went to Islington this afternoon to look for rooms for Tom; it is a fine autumn day; Vita & Leon dined last night, & I am so dissipated I could not write a word this morning. Then Bunny came about the hoax. So to tea, & I should add so to Westminster to hear The March of the Women, Ethel Smyth; & Rebecca speaking on married womens earnings. Instead I shall sleep over the fire, reading Tomâ€™s criticism, & Michael Field diaries, alone thank God.
