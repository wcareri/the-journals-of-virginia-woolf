### Tuesday 8 August

Since we came here I have been twice to Charleston; seen the Keyneses; been to Worthing; had Eth Read (a nice shrewd hard girl with a public mind) to tea; the Easdales & Norman Stewart (a clever, good fellow, scientist) to tea; expect Mrs Nef at 3 to discuss her scandalous memoirs: we go to London on Friday & Ethel comes on Sunday. Is this peace? Iâ€™m heavy brained todayâ€”its been so hot; & I have read Mrs Nef from 10 to 12.20. Scandals about USA: but I am sworn to secrecy. I imagine a pretty youngish jumpy intellectual-fashionable American, completely disoriented; writes rather well; interesting; but all at sea.
