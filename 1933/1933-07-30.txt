Settled in again here. A question how far places influence oneâ€™s mood. Certain thoughts I always think: the downs spoilt, could we move, &c. leading to a well known round. Quentin ill with pleurisy; may have to have an operationâ€”This the first illness at Charleston. We dine there tonight. And, in order to refresh my mind for P.s Iâ€™ve been writing memoirs, & cant disinfect my mind of Fitzroy Sqre. so strong is the pastâ€”so as to read Italian. Iâ€™m telling the story of W.H. & H.Y. But I am organising life here, & so far rather well. Reading & walking & swimming into lucid depths, powerfullyâ€”thats how I put it. And people impend, but can be shelved for the momentâ€”Colefax, Elizabeth Read, Julia, the Wolves &c ..

Mrs B.â€™s case is interesting. It reflects credit on humanity. Her half cousin Lydia Hastie, a mad wandering witted old woman died in Florence & left 17,000: half to Mrs B. This represents safety indeed luxury for life. Now we come down & are given all the lawyers letters. Signora Colli who looked after the dying demented Hastieâ€”Hastieâ€™s letters to Mr Duncan in Aberdeen on politics very interesting; & her perpetual shifting of Josephus, Macaulay & so onâ€”this Colli writes that she had expected 600 a year. And so would certainly have got it, had Miss H. signed a codicil. Pâ . & Mrs B. say they will offer her Â£50 p.a. if the other legatee will do the same. She is not grasping, Miss Colli, accounts for every penny, & Dr Potts is humane: & the B.â€™s full of sense & restraintâ€”more than I, had I suddenly one thousand without working. These little tributes to human nature are deserved after Hitler & Mussoliniâ€”about whom Miss Hastie often wrote. I figure her perpetually arranging her blue & gold tea set, her fathers watch, the bon bon box, & the card box made of the Fern oak in Windsor â€œwhich was mentioned in Shakespeareâ€ in the house in Florence, where she lived with Colli aged 76.
