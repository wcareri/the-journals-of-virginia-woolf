Anrep coming in half an hourâ€”10-10â€”so I cant even pretend to settle down to write. (Elvira scene finished). Oh yesterday! Oh yesterday!

Figure to yourself lunch on a hot day at the Shaws. Long narrow room overlooking river & white sepulchral buildings. The Binyons. He a plethoric bolt eyed congested little man; she, washy watery. Mrs Shaw small gimleteyed. In comes Shaw, alert for business, but not in the mood. No one in the mood. Lunch in another long narrow room. Unreal hotel lunch, butlers. Service Kitchen. Shawâ€™s paddle actually out of the water. Cutting no ice. Had to make a speech to friends of the Nat. Libraries that afternoon; didnt know what their object was; but hoped to say something unpleasant about the conference. And I talked. And I said This is dâ€”d dull. I said it at intervals. Nothing flourished. Every saying died as spoken. All I retrieved was: Shaw does not visualise. I think of the sharp key as brass â€”thats all. I never see my characters. I feel them in another way. Also, he had been sounded about the O.Â M. Baldwin said, heâ€™ll only guy us. â€œI said I have already conferred the Order of Merit on myselfâ€. Storiesâ€”about China: some heâ€™d told us already. L.â€™s hand clattered. Story about his fathers love, which I share, of anti-climax. Throw them all into the Liffeyâ€”of his ancestors bones, when they wanted to make a new church. And I kept saying no the drug wonâ€™t work. Never once did it work; & we were all gladâ€”Shaw gladâ€”when Mrs S. whose mild babble is continuousâ€”moved; & we never sat down, but had one look at the river, & Shaw escorted us along the black & white passageâ€”very jaunty, uprightâ€”sea green eyes red face to the lift. A man of perfect poiseâ€”springâ€”agilityâ€”never to me interestingâ€”no poet, but what an efficient, adept, trained arch & darter! His wires, his spring, at 76 entirely astonishing. And the hands flung out in gesture: he has the power to make the world his shapeâ€”to me not a beautiful shapeâ€”thats all. So home.

Very hot. Very hot. Had to write a letter for M. Fry about opening Squares. At 3.20 Anrepâ€”to Ottâ€™s. Ott in blue & red muslinâ€”dangling earrings. What is it? Our affection for you Ott: we wish you to lunchâ€”â€”Oh dear, no I couldnt, I couldnt. Philip come & protect me!! Enter P. rather moth eaten. I am entirely on Ottâ€™s side. Publicity. Too like Jack Squire. Besides, we still see our friends. And Clive has done very well without us. Do you think we are over? And so onâ€”rather suspicious, rather hurt, rather on the high horse. And Ott genuinely disliking the ceremony. And Boris genuinely anxious expostulatory, deliberate rotundâ€”grasping his hat & making a speechâ€”determined. And P. saying, rather with intent, Ott has been at deathâ€™s door (yes, & we were none of us very kind then) & now, as you dont realise, cant stand any strain. Oh but we arent suggesting that she should give more partiesâ€”(And youâ€™ll never come to parties she does give. This was sub-acute). Anyhow we walked up to Tâ avistock Sâ quare with herâ€”she to have her feet tendedâ€”& then Bâ oris so he said, overcame her & kissed her in the street. So back here Then the wallet with the pass to the Pullman Cars picked up in the street. Then Ethelâ€”oh & I was dumb, chill, completely insentient; & she tried to stage a quarrel & failedâ€”failed, poor old woman, in all her effectsâ€”with the pinks tooâ€”was very unattractiveâ€”felt itâ€”suggested going. Did I care? No. I could feel nothing, was dazed, impotent, so led her down the stairs, she, perhaps, suffering, perhaps notâ€”& off she went, & I sank at lastâ€”at lastâ€”into silence. For had we not had Barbara Hutchinson twice, about her lover: had I not signed books, & gone to tea with Nelly Cecil, & picked up my ears with Lord Bobâ€”& then the dinner with Bunnyâ€”taciturn, monolithicâ€”& Eâ lizabeth Bowen, conventionalâ€”& so on: all this I say has been whizzing & buzzing; & now Boris comes with Maynardâ€™s letter of invitation to the Ott tea: whereupon out drops Ottâ€™s refusal. No, no no, I cant. So thats over. And now to Rodmell this very hot June day.
