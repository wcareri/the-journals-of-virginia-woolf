### Monday 26 June

The present moment. 7 oâ€™clock on June 26th: L. printing: hot: thunderous: I after reading Henry 4 Pt one saying whats the use of writing; reading, imperfectly, a poem by Leopardi; the present moment, in my studio. A bucket banged in the mews; dog barks; woman, â€˜I didnâ€™t know if you were out here.â€™ Leaves door open: far away horns; a bee buzzing. Boboâ€™s first night; King lays stone of London Unâ iversity Doctors, scarlet, purple in streets; poor little students in gowns: so to dine, & read Archibald Marshallâ€™s memoir; & music; thunder, I dare say; & so to open my windows, & go up: the moment done.
