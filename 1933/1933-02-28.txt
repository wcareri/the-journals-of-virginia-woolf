### Tuesday 28 March

The polite letters have been sent. So far I have had, nor could have had any answer. No, thank Heaven, I need not emerge from my fiction in July to have a tuft of fur put on my head. It is the finest spring ever knownâ€”soft, hot, blue, misty. The trees all out, the other day in the park, when we took Bunnyâ€™s child to Hayling Island. It was a June day. Poor Ray like a slum woman, so gaunt, so grim. He had a boat. It was cold on the beachâ€”the Island is spotted with houses, like the rest of the world. And then down to Maidenhead in June weatherâ€”more bungalows. And dinner with Ly Rhondda. I felt her a disappointed woman. Should have had 10 children perhaps. She was sitting alone, shawled dowdy in an old Hampstead half flat with a garden with great trees. She is what they call, I expect, â€˜inhibitedâ€™â€”something tentative furtive. Discussed Time & Tide &c. She lives for T. & T. but is a little under the thumb of Mr Ellis Roberts. Then on to Clive; back from Jamaica. â€œThe steward came in; & was surprised to find a young lady stark naked brushing her teeth.â€ True Clive. Julian has failed to get his fellowship, & thinks, or Nessa thinks, of Burma.
