### Monday 25 September

The week end was sheer drudgery & has left me out of temper out of mood. Roger seems hopeless. Yet if one cant write, as Duncan said yesterday, one may as well kill oneself. Such despair comes over meâ€”waking early. And weâ€™re fretted & tormented with peopleâ€”Portia Holman today, Johnâ€”Vita. Then Q. & perhaps Judithâ€”How can I cool & smooth my head? But I intend to work.

L.â€™s book out today.
