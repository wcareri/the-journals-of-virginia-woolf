### Tuesday 27 June

Talk of Gertler at Cliveâ€™s. Old Cory rather deflated (in spirit, not body). Frothy talk, succeeding 2Â½ hours interview with Philip & his milky eyed little boy who wants to be a sailor. But doesnt want it very much. No, they dont want anything, said Phil, who doesnt want to go to Brittany, about which he consulted us.

Eliot & Morley today. So the days are rushed through.

Gollancz prevaricating.
