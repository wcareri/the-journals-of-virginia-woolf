### Sunday 1 October

This last week a mere scramble of people. Q. & Bradfield; then Judith; asked if she might stay. Then Leslie â€¦ talk talkâ€”bowls in a blizzard. Proof correcting. Then the divine relief last night of silence alone with L. Rain today. But peaceâ€”my private peaceâ€”restored. London tomorrow. Sunday clearing up. Oh how torturing life in common is! like trying to drink a cup of tea & always its dashed from one. Judith has her jocose school girl garrulity increased by the rather commonplace Leslie. A pity she shd. marry himâ€”porous, stupid, good humoured, Tunbridge Wells to the backbone.
