### Sunday 3 September

This is I suppose certainly the last hour of peace. The time limit is out at 11. PM to broadcast at 11.15. L. & I â€œstood byâ€ 10 minutes ago. Why repeat whatâ€™ll be in all the papers? We argued. L. said Greenwood was rightâ€”forcing the PM in the House last night. I argued its â€œtheyâ€ as usual who do this. We as usual remain outside. If we win,â€”then what? L. said its better to win; because the Germans, vanquished, are what they are. Musâ soliniâ€™â s last try, a try on. All the formulae are now a mere surface for gangsters. So we chopped words. I suppose the bombs are falling on rooms like this in Warsaw. A fine sunny morning here; apples shining. Mabel came to my regret last night. Atmosphere at once stiff & prickly. Mustnâ€™t mind, says L. No children yet come. Nessa & Angelica over as I took up the book yesterday. 14 in house: 3 children dumped. Maynard has given Q. a job as tractor driver. This is a relief. No one knows how weâ€™re to fight. Rumours beginning. A flurry of people shopping in Lewes yesterday: the flight of cars with beds fairly thick. Shops rather empty. People buying stuff for windows. Little girl says If we have a chink theyâ€™ll spy us out. Flint cross. Many of them thatâ€”as if half unhappy half resentful. No excitement visible. Mâ abel said train very empty. I believe little exact notes are more interesting than reflectionsâ€”the only reflection is that this is bosh & stuffing compared with the reality of reading say Tawney; writing, & re-writing one sentence of Roger. So this experiment proves the reality of the mind. Two hours sewing curtains. An anodyne, pleasant to do something: but so tepid & insipid. Oneâ€™s too tired, emotionally, to read a page. I tried Tawney last nightâ€”cdnâ€™t concentrate. Church bells ringing. Mrs Ebbs carrying a sheaf of gladioli. Where from? Breaky Bottom. They hardly ever come to church, but now & then send lovely flowers for the church. Question: if we had a church? The relief of having some common outside interest or belief. If it were a belief â€¦ Q. & A. to eat Johnâ€™s grouse.

Its the unreality of force that muffles every thing. Its now about 10.33. Not to attitudinise is one reflection. Nice to be entirely genuine & obscure. Then of course I shall have to work to make money. Thats a comfort. Write articles for America. I suppose take on some writing for some society. Keep the Press going. Of course no beds or heat on at 37. So far plenty of petrol. Sugar rationed. So I shall now go in. Nothing in the garden or meadows that strikes me out of the wayâ€”& certainly I cant write.
