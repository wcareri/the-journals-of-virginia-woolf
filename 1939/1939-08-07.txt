### Monday 7 August

I am now going to make the rash & bold experiment of breaking off, from condensing Vision & Design, to write here for 10 minutes instead of revising, as I ought, my mornings grind.

Oh yes. I thought of several things to write about. Not exactly diary. Reflections. Thats the fashionable dodge. Peter Lucas & Gide both at it. Neither can settle to creative art (I think, sans Roger, I could). Its the commentâ€”the daily interjectionâ€”that comes handy in times like these. I too feel it. But what was I thinking?

I have been thinking about Censors. How visionary figures admonish us. Thats clear in an MS Iâ€™m reading. If I say this So & So will think me sentimental. If that â€¦ will think me Bourgeois. All books now seem to me surrounded by a circle of invisible censors. Hence their selfconsciousness, their restlessness. It wd. be worth while trying to discover what they are at the moment. Did Wordsworth have them? I doubt it. I read Ruth before breakfast. Its stillness, its unconsciousness, its lack of distraction, its concentration & the resulting â€œbeautyâ€ struck me. As if the mind must be allowed to settle undisturbed over the object in order to secrete the pearl.

Thats an idea for an article.

The figurative expression is that all the surroundings of the mind have come much closer. A child crying in the field brings poverty: my comfort: to mind. Ought I to go to the village sports? Ought thus breaks in to my contemplation.

Oh & I thought, as I was dressing, how interesting it would be to describe the approach of age, & the gradual coming of death. As people describe love. To note every symptom of failure: but why failure? To treat age as an experience that is different from the others; & to detect every one of the gradual stages towards death which is a tremendous experience, & not as unconscious at least in its approaches, as birth is.

I must now return to my grind. I think rather refreshed.

Clive at Cn yesterday, with an enormous white jersey which he patted & prodded from time to time. A little testy about his room.

I neednâ€™t say Iâ€™ve been palmed off with the worst in the house. Desiring sympathy, Duncan said, & admiration. All his books were put in order by the others. Rather an elderly tea party. Q. away.
