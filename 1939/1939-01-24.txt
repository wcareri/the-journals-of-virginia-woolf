### Tuesday 24 January

On the placards this afternoon: Franco at the gate of Barcelona: Measures for defence. This refers to our new voluntary service. The one is the cause of the other. Yesterday 300 bullets were found thrown into the bushes the other side of Tavistock Square. A reporter came to ask if Mr Woolf could give any information. One of the Irish rebels lodges in Tavistock Place or Court. These are notes I scribble hastily, while L. (exacerbated by the itch again) goes to the Cocktail at the BBC. I to read over Helenâ€™s letters, on a fine spring day, the eve of my 57th birthday. And on the bus coming back from the Flower Show I described my new â€˜novelâ€™: & we planned the books we shd. write, if we could live another 30 years.
