### Friday 23 June

Back to London again after 4 weeks. Two spent driving about Brittany. I kept notes in a little square ruled pocketbook in my bag; a good method perhaps, if carried out in London; but I doubt if its worth sticking them here. Perhaps a few, for like pressed leaves they somehow bring back the whole forgotten hedge. So soon forgotten in bulk. The London uproar at once rushes in. Okampo today; John; then I must go to Penman. We have 37 Mâ ecklenburgh Square: & this is still unlet. Ben Nicolson has spread my studio with MSS all laid on the floor. This scarcely helps my attack on R, begun this morning. The appallingly difficult PIP chapter. How to get the right proportions &c. I have now 5 weeks before August. And 200 pages to do. Difficulties with Gollancz about L.â€™s book not yet stated. And people abound. But I must do my job like a navvy & let society rip & clothes &c. Hereâ€™s lunch.
