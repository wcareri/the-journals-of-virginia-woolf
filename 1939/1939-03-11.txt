### Saturday 11 March

Yesterday, that is Friday 10th, I set the last word to the first sketch of Roger. And now I have to beginâ€”well not even to begin, but to revise & revise. A terrible grind to come: & innumerable doubts, of myself as biographer: of the possibility of doing it at all: all the same Iâ€™ve carried through to the end; & may allow myself one moments mild gratification. There are the facts more or less extracted. And Iâ€™ve no time to go into all the innumerable horrors. There may be a flick of life in itâ€”or is it all dust & ashes?

A day in bed at MH: such a rush with the meeting, & dining at Câ harleston & then back to the burglary. I heard the burglar laugh as he slammed the door taking our Â£6 in a cashbox. We thought it was John. Then the Great Psycho Analysts dinner on a wild wet night: Adrian late: dinner at 9 till 12.30. Speeches of a vacancy & verbosity incredible. Lord de la Warr rambling jocosely. And gossip with Duncan & Adrian; the rest of our table sit in unmitigable gloom. Poor Mrs so & soâ€”Meynell & Money Kyrle dead silent: food profuse, snatched, uncharacteristic. Mary Hutch: Rebecca West: & set upon & committed to ask to dinner Mrs Klein.

Then a cocktail at Johnâ€™s; Rosamond & her new fancy, little self conscious G. Rees, underbred, intelligent; & our German vonâ€”something. I shall call you Renny said L. And I dont know why I agreed to lunch with Diana Cooper to meet Ethel Smyth on the spur of the momentâ€”why am I so impulsive? Why am I so old, so ugly, soâ€”& cant write. And the Spender grandmother on Sunday; but alone today.
