### Monday 11 September

I have just read 3 or 4 Characters of Theophrastus, stumbling from Greek to English, & may as well make a note of it. Trying to anchor my mind on Greek. Rather successful. As usual, how Greek sticks, darts, eels in & out! No Latin wd have noted that a boor remembers his loans in the middle of the night. The Greek has his eye on the object. But its a long distance one has to roll away to get at Theophrastus & Plato. But worth the effort.

Mrs Nicholls a great frost. A painted metallic shrill nagging woman; with a mind that pecks the same rotten apple againâ€”this side, that side. Her daughter: & her future: & Tigger the Dalmatian: full of her shoddy contacts; her cocktails: shall I buy a housecoat for raids or trousers? At last, at 8 am, she left us; but depressed, for one doesnt like coins to turn out false. Of course she ruined Sunday tea: Charleston over. Much grumbling from Clive at their inmates. Nessa who is making a chicken house is philosophic. But she compares the Grants & Breretons.

To London on Thursday. Pitiless fine weather. Over London a light spotted veilâ€”the balloons. Very empty streets. A curious strained silence. At the Press, Miss P. listening for Sirens. So I listened. Sat in the sunny window. Cases all empty but piled up. Mabel & I laid carpets. Sandwiches with John. Stephen came in. His great joints seemed to crack. Eyes stared. Is writing reams about himself. Canâ€™t settle to poetry. London after sunset a mediaevel city of darkness & brigandage. Mrs Connolly told by a taxi man he had just been robbed & knocked over the head. The darkness they say is the worst of it. The air raid had been very tryingâ€”at 2.30. John had drunk a glass of water & sat in the cellar. No one can control their nerves. So I was glad to be on the road home. No raids yet. Poland being conquered, & thenâ€”we shall be attended to.

Iâ€™ve offered to write for the NS. I dont know if wisely: but itâ€™s best to have a job, & I dont think I can stand aloof with comfort at the moment. So my reasons are half in half. Intolerable tedium.â€”no papers: no letters; & all this made up talk with Nicholls.

Cooler now.
