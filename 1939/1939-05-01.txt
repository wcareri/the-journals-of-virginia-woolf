### Monday 1 May

A bad morning, because Iâ€™m dried up about Roger. Iâ€™m determined thoâ€™ to plod through & make a good job, not a work of art. Thats the only way. To force myself onâ€”& yes to relax with a fiction: & then a few days in the Cotswolds. But thereâ€™s no blinking the fact that it is drudgery & must be; & I must go through with it. My hand, as I see, wont write.
