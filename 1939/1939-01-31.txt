### Tuesday 31 January

A very sensible day yesterday. Saw no one. Took the bus to Southwark Bridge. Walked along Thames Street; saw a flight of steps down to the river. I climbed downâ€”a rope at the bottom. Found the strand of the Thames, under the warehousesâ€”strewn with stones, bits of wire, slippery; ships lying off the Bridge (Southwark?â€”no, the one next to Tower Bridge). Very slippery; warehouse walls crusted, weedy, worn. The river must cover them at high tide. It was now low. People on the Bridge stared. Difficult walking. A rat haunted, riverine place, great chains, wooden pillars, green slime, bricks corroded, a button hook thrown up by the tide. A bitter cold wind. Thought of the refugees from Barcelona walking 40 miles, one with a baby in a parcel. So to Tower. Made a circuit: discovered St Olaveâ€™s Hart Street: Pepys Church; too cold to explore; wandered about Fenchurch alleys, Billingsgate; walked through Leadenhall Market; thought of Thoby buying the wild geese; saw a golden pheasant; so back by omnibus; the street & shops the product of this factory world; tried to buy Wells (Country of the Blind) praised by Tom tâ€™other night; failed; so home; left the kettle on; it blew out its connection; read Michelet; wrote to Desmond about his poetess; L. out at Fabians; played gramophone; listened to Our Masters Voice, Hitler less truculent than expected; read MSS; read The Magnificent Rothschilds; & so to bed.

My head has now protested once more against Roger & facts; so to humour it, I wrote the old Henry Taylor telescope story thats been humming in my mind these 10 years; & have a feeling of life & activity again. Put off Eth Bowen & Sean Oâ€™Faolain this afternoon, we go to Mrs Woolf instead: & now, as usual, lunch.
