### Sunday 14 May

That last sentence might be repeated. Its a fortnight I see since I had my few minutes margin between Roger & lunch. And thus I need not repeat the fact that my head is a tight wound ball of string. To unwind it, I lie on my Heal chair bed & doze of an evening. But the noise worries me. The 2 houses next door are down; we are shored up. There are patches of wall paper where there used to be hotel bedrooms. Thus the Southampton Row traffic gets at me; & I long for 37 Mecklenburgh Sq: but doubt if we shall get it. Pritchard is negotiating with the Bedfords. A talk about the future with John. He is harassed by the lean year. Cant live in London on Â£500 minus his mothers interest &c. 37 is a large seeming & oh so quiet house, where I could sleep anywhere. But it dont do to dwell on it. & there would be the horror of the move in August. Day Lewis came one day; thrust in on the wake of Elizabeth. A stocky sturdy man. truculent, a little like Muggins 40 yrs ago, as I think George called Malcolm Macnaghten. â€œPriestley lolling on the beachâ€ was discussed. I made him laugh by repeating that word. I wish I could repeat more words. Boswell did it. Could I turn B. at my age? â€œIâ€™m doing films for the gas people â€¦ I live a purely country life. A rather too arty home. Devonshire.â€ I infer some rupture with the Bugger Boys.

Boswell at Sissinghurst. Gwen walking through the Bluebell woods, speaking of her youthâ€”a little to justify herself. Had been advertiser to a scent shop, had done welfare work. Her daughter Jiccy meets a prostitute outside the Berkeley whom she has delivâ ered. â€œMust just speak to Bessyâ€ she says to the youth whoâ€™s treating herâ€”â€œIts her beat.â€ G. a little shocked. And I liked the soft cream & yellow flowers on the sunny grass & the bend stooping like a picture. And the thread of bright blue bells: & Vita in her breeches.

We are going to Brittany by the way after Whitsun. A whole 2 weeks rambling. Now thatâ€™ll fill my dry cistern of a head. But this is nothing like so bad as The Years. A nun writes to invite me to stage a meeting of Outsiders in Hyde Park. I stop to answer her. Gertler tonight.
