Talk at Nessaâ€™s last night. Much about Gertlerâ€™s suicide. He gassed himself 2 nights ago in his studio. We had talked with him about his other attempt the night he dined with us. It was because of some hitch in his work he said then, & he had completely recovered. He had got through into a new stage as a painter. This was true, Nessa & Duncan said; his last show, just over, was a great advance & very remarkable. So why did he turn on the gas, when his model left him? She found him, when she came back, still alive, but unconscious. A most resolute serious man: intellectual; fanatical about painting, even if a fanatical egotist. And he seemed established; with his own friends; dining out with Priestleys & Lynds. Poor of course, & forced to teach; & fundamentally perhaps too rigid, too self centred, too honest & narrow, like Kot in his uncompromising severity, to be content or happy. But with his intellect & interest, why did the personal life become too painful? His wife? We know no more.

Angelica better; & no time to describe our lunch with Flora, & her analysis, clear & unflinching, of the old tyrant, the matriarch manqueÃ©.
