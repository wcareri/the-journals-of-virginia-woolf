### Wednesday 25 October

About the 24th anyhow. And â€œthe war begins today.â€ So Ribbenthrop said or rather howled last night. For so far its sporadic & halfhearted. How then can I say anything about it here? Here it peters out. I rode my cycle to Lewes yesterday. Now Nessaâ€™s come & is painting L. & Sally is recovering. And its a blowy but sunny autumn day. And Iâ€™m screwed like a vice to the re-composing of the last chapter wh. Iâ€™m running into one, called Transformations. Its a question of arrangement. Then a new quote comes & alters all the proportions. But I think if I can see steadily for a fortnight I shall have grasped it. Temptations to write other things fret me. R.Mâ ortimer, sends books. A dog story wd. bring in Â£200. & Freudâ€™s papers. As a journalist Iâ€™m in demand (not with the TLS though). To relax I read Little Dorrit & think of going on with my Auâ tobiographâ y. Never have I been so set on my own spinning. Gerald Heardâ€™s book spun me to distraction last night. So good & suggestive & firm for 200 pages: then a mere bleat bitter repetition contorsion & inversion. Like a dog going after its tail; & there is no tail. No, heâ€™s nothing to offer, once heâ€™s done historical accounting. A mere tangle. And his fanatical starved or as he would say strangulated individuality presides. A scream, a distracted scream issues, instead of the soaring spirit. So I shant read Aldous. wh. develops GH in fiction. So to lunch. And a meeting tonight.
