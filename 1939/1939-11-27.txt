### Monday 27 November

Since I wrote here, we have been in London, had a party, A. & K. & Rose Mac; seen Colefax; & come back. It is all storm & rain now. Many ships sunk. Men out in boats. The magnetic mine active. Châ amberlain speaking like a military shopwalker. Ive been drudging at 2 articles, one Bewick; done & sent off R.â€™s first chapters. Feel rather free now Iâ€™m thoroughly snubbed & put in my place for Reviewing. L. was praised by Desmond in the Sunday Timesâ€”& Lord what a day! What a storm to rush through back to the house.

Lunch Charleston yesterday. Judith Bagenal; sharp; obvious; but assured & I should say a good worker, not a drone, will marry her clergyman I should say. Clive away. D. has sold a picture to the Queen. I forgot about our legacy. Nor do we know how much. Stellaâ€™s settlement money. This was a surprise. Henry wrote & told me. Perhaps 4 or 500 each? This will serve at anyrate to gild our pillâ€”the 7/6 income tax. A long war its to be, Sybil said. The Empire to be destroyed in May. This is only the prelude to the operation. Now for the wet.
