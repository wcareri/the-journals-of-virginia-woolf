Freud said It would have been worse if you had not won the war. I said we often felt guiltyâ€”if we had failed, perhaps Hitler would have not been. No, he said, with great emphasis; he would have been infinitely worse. They considered leaving for 3 months; made up their minds in 24 hours. Very alert at L.â€™s mention of the case when the Judge decreed that the criminal should read 20 of Freudâ€™s books. Adrian says the Pss Bonaparte gave him this great silent solid Hampstead mansion. â€œBut we dont like it as well as our flat in Viennaâ€ said Anna. A certain strain: all refugees are like gulls with their beaks out for possible crumbs. Martin & his novel; she on her book. The strain on us too of being benefactors.

Aâ drianâ€™s party varied & no doubt successful. The young danced till 3. Bobo in crimson velvet, Tom in Lyttonâ€™s beard with a brown pop eye: Janice in a great nose; Clive ebullient, dancing with Bobo; repairing that old breach. Duncan a blond French prince: Ann almost naked, very distinguished, lovely; aloof; fierce; Richard urbane & inscrutable: always the same, Angelica said; Molly oldish; Rachel in a red shawl, about to bear a Cecil; David chirping about his book, out on Thursday; attacked, liked, disliked; refused by USA & Book Society &c. And the usual bobbing corks on the wavesâ€”dullards hoping to get into touch with someone or thing & approaching & driven off & then attaching themselves: Portia Holman, the Enfields. A kind of liberation caused by wearing a mask, tipsiness & abandonment at not being oneâ€™s usual self. Tom expanding in the lights & stir, much as I do.

Last night Yeatsâ€™ death announced. That great thick long jowled poet, whom I met last at Ottolineâ€™s. Dotty will fall from her high estate; but I try to cultivate sympathy rather than satire. And we are all on tiptoe, waiting Hitlerâ€™s speech tonight.
