### Wednesday 29 March

There can be no doubt that Tom knew that his play was a failure. He was very yellow & heavy lidded. We talked about his cold, & I noted that he said his lectures, on Church & State, were â€œvery badâ€, a proof, I think, that all his work now seems so. But the evening was oddly successful. Kingsley Martin invited himself, & gave Ann & Sally their modicum of politics; otherwise literature wd have been too ascendant. Then Mr Ellis St Joseph, also self-invited, came. And paid out elaborate, yet oddly interesting, stories: about smoking hashishâ€”how he was given for 10/- amber cigarettes wh. he supposed to be drugged; & puffed in & out, with Oliver Bell on the next bed. And they were only scented. An intricate, pompous, yet interesting young man. And they stayed till 12.30. Hence Iâ€™m tired in the head, & cant tackle anything. Think of walking, to prepare for Hugh. A silly idea, having him alone; but I must brisk up something, not sit dreaming here, or my head will ache. KM. privately told L. that German aeroplanes have been flying over London.

Madrid surrendered. KM. says war is inevitable.
