The use of this book is to write things out, hence: the Greenhouse. Iâ€™m so unhappy. A portmanteau word. Analysed: headache; guilt; remorse â€¦ The house, L.â€™s house, â€¦ oh dear, his hobbyâ€”his pear tree peach treeâ€”to be pulled down because of me. How can I get sensible? I mind so much. Oh dearâ€”the conflictâ€”the ugliness: v: L.â€™s wish. And is it worth this misery?â€”oughtnâ€™t I to have said go ahead, when he came to me in the Bath this morning? The men had comeâ€”Shd. they put it up? I said you must decide. So he sent them away & its to be pulled down. How to live it over? Forget he says: but I shant â€¦ & cant read or writeâ€”.

I have composed myself, momentarily, by reading through this years diary. Thats a use for it then. It composes. Why? I think shows one a stretch, when oneâ€™s grubbing in an inch. Head relieved anyhow by reading. Odd that I can read here without repulsion. Why? My own mind I suppose claws me when others slip.

I forget that we came down; & its been fine, rather; lovely on the marsh. Hay cutting. Figures spaced on the marsh. Old Bob thanks me for my letter. Much hurt by Stephenâ€™s review. A letter from Susie Tweedsmuirâ€”deadly dull at Quebec. Reading Gideâ€™s diaries, recommended by poor death mask Eddie. An interesting knotted book. Its queer that diaries now pullulate. No one can settle to a work of art. Comment only. That explains but scarcely excuses Peter Lucas; & his exhibition of Prudence. Shd. one judge people by what they write? Shd. people show their naked skins? Eddie shows his death maskâ€”Dear, I forgot my shudder at Helenâ€™s son; nor can dissect my mix up of the debt, the dislike of Igorâ€™s great fleshy mouth. (Iâ€™m whistling to keep up my spirits this very strained grey dayâ€”the Greenhouse morning.) I must now carry off lunch. What annoys me is L.â€™s adroitness in fathering the guilt on me. His highhandedness. I see the temptation. â€œOh you dont want itâ€”so I submit.â€ This spoilt bowls last night. We shied them at the Jack. Yet so happy in our reconciliation. â€œDo you ever think me beautiful now?â€ â€œThe most beautiful of womenâ€â€”
