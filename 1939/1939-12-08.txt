### Friday 8 December

Two days in London: a great distraction; leaving my mind in a torn state, which I record, being all of a muzz. Lady Simon; a 3 talk, so a little disappointing. A nice woman. Did I wish to expose some egotism? I suppose so. Its breaking into new levels after concentrating here thats so distracting, & I daresay salutary. Shoppingâ€”tempted to buy jerseys & so on. I dislike this excitement, yet enjoy it. Ambivalence as Freud calls it. (Iâ€™m gulping up Freud). Then Ethel & Gillies. That upset meâ€”Ethelâ€™s wigâ€”5 incongruous curls, that made her look babyish & foolish. Also she has gone downhill. She is now shut up quite alone in her old ageâ€”talks to herself, about herself. I felt this pathetic: also somehow ugly; humiliating; watching the old baby sucking its corals; compliments; the old story of her genius & its non-recognition. How hideous to be reduced to that kind of feeblemindednessâ€”at 84. Something pitiable, unvenerable; not imbecile, but near it. Or was it partly her curls that were so distasteful? Gillies chattering about war secrets: Ethel mumbling on about what Bruno Walter said toâ€”no I didnt listen after a time. And HBâ€™s death; & what he said in 1890 about The Wreckers. I think it was pity more than anything that I felt; & all her clothes were undone; shaggy; untidyâ€”like King Lear only without any tragedy or poetry. And the old charm in abeyance. Off she went to Plesh. Then off I went to the Galeries Lafayette. Out of that brilliancy I stepped into dead darknessâ€”had no torch. A curious wild beautyâ€”medieval, furtiveâ€”figures shuffling & darting Then Willie Robson. To stir the brew still further, into a race & whirlpool, a letter from The Forum asking me to write about women & peace. All the old, & a few new, ideas at once rise to the surface. I lay awake writing articles. It might be an outlet. But didnâ€™t I swear I would abjure controversy for a year? Isnt R.F. a finer piece of work? But for America?â€”then the moneyâ€”then the desire to let fly: also, I suppose, to justify myself? Cant form letters. Raining hard.
