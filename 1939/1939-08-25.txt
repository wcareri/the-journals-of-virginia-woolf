Perhaps it is more interesting to describe â€˜The Crisisâ€™ than R.â€™s love affairs. Yes we are in the very thick of it. Are we at war? At one Iâ€™m going to listen in. Its very different, emotionally, from last September. In London yesterday there was indifference almost. No crowd in the trainâ€”we went by train. No stir in the streets. One of the removers called up. Its fate, as the foreman said. What can you do against fate? Complete chaos at 37. Ann met in graveyard. No war, of course not, she said. John said Well I dont know what to think. But as a dress rehearsal its complete. Museums shut. Search light on Rodmell Hill. Châ amberlaiâ n says danger imminent. The Russian pact a disagreeable & unforeseen surprise. Rather like a herd of sheep we are. No enthusiasm. Patient bewilderment. I suspect some desire â€œto get on with itâ€. Order double supplies & some coal. Aunt Violet in refuge at Charleston. Unreal. Whiffs of despair. Difficult to work. Offer of Â£100 from Chambrun for a story. Haze over the marsh. Aeroplanes. One touch on the switch & we shall be at war. Dantzig not yet taken. Clerks cheerful. I add one little straw to another, waiting to go in, palsied with writing. Thereâ€™s no cause now to fight for, said Ann. Communists baffled. Railway strike off. Ld. Halifax broadcasts in his country gentlemans voice. Louie says will clothes be dear? Underneath of course wells of pessimism. Young men torn to bits: mothers like Nessa 2 years ago. But again, some swerve to the right may come at any moment. The common feeling covers the private, then recedes. Discomfort & distraction. And all mixed with the mess at 37.
