### Tuesday 28 February

It is unfortunate, for truths sake, that I never write here except when jangled with talk. I only record the dumps & the dismals, & them very barely. A holiday from Roger. And one dayâ€™s happiness with P.H. Then too many parcels; books coming out; & a head numb at the back. As usual, when Iâ€™m prone, all the gnats settle. The usual ones: I neednt specify. I have to â€˜speakâ€™ to polytechnics; & engagements multiply. Innumerable refugees to add to the tangle. Thereâ€”Iâ€™ve recorded them when I said I wouldnt. Harold upstairs talking, about refugees, to L. I go in, out of courtesy. He is doing a job for me.

Morgan to lunch yesterday. Much argument: communism defined, also his duties on the Libel Commission: also gossip about Peter & Prudence; she mad. Nessa after dinner. My old thorn about Helen rankles. Oh sheâ€™ll never repay you. Lives as usual. Saxon 20 minutes on the phone. Will I lunch with Graham Harris. Odd change into a deliberate old manâ€™s voice. Add to this my petty jealousies. All the same I think I can stamp it out, literally, by walking this afternoon. Plenty of things to see; neednt buy clothes; & sleep over a book. So shall be sane tomorrow. If it were not 12.15 I would walk now. Only it pours. So I will read poetry quietly, I thinkâ€”having Shelley down here with me.

I have just read Mont Blanc, but cant make it â€œcomposeâ€: clouds perpetually over lapping. If a new poem, what should I say? I think a great idea somewhere; but the language so nebulous, or rather words overlapping, like ripples, each effacing the other, partly: & a general confusion results.

Yesterday, Franco was recognised. And Julian killed for this. Nessa though I suppose making herself live: succeeding: very busy.
