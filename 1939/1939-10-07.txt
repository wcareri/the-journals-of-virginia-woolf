### Saturday 7 October

Its odd how those first days of complete nullity when war broke outâ€”have given place to such a pressure of ideas & work that I feel the old throb & spin in my head more of a drain than ever. The result partly of taking up journalism. A good move, I daresay; for it compacts; & forces me to organise. Iâ€™m masterfully pulling together those diffuse chapters of R. because I know I must stop & do an article. Ideas for articles obsess me. Why not try the one for The Times? No sooner said than Iâ€™m ravaged by ideas. Have to hold the Roger fortâ€”for I will have the whole book typed & in Nessaâ€™s hands by Xmasâ€”by force. Chaâ mâ brun now demands a dog story: the other too sophisticated. So I have that floating about. In short Iâ€™m more on the buzz than when I was contemplating books only. And it keeps me feverishly skating over the thin ice.

We have a fortnight its said to consider Hitlerâ€™s terms. If rejected, all the guns boom. So we may get a last safe week in London. And I dont much want to go. Once settled here, it seems congenial to stop. The war has at least made the country question easy to solve. Tom sent me his Cat poems today. A very wet day.

Châ arleston. yesterday. Gages heard booming. Nessa exposed to show the house. A. & Q. in hiding A. says she will cry if I call her, compared with the public spirited Judith a butterfly. One review of L.â€™s book: good; but merely expositional.

Clive says everyone wants peace.
