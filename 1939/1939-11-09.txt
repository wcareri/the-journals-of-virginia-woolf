### Thursday 9 November

How glad I am to escape to my free page. But I think Iâ€™m nearing the end of my trouble with Roger, doing once more the last pages: & I think I like it better than before. I think the idea of breaking up the last chapter into sections was a good one. If only I can bring that end off. The worst of journalism is that it distracts. Like a shower on the top of the sea. Revâ iewing came out last week; & was not let slip into obscurity as I expected. Lit Sup had a tart & peevish leader: the old tone of voice I know so wellâ€”rasped & injured. Then YY polite but aghast in the NS. And then my answerâ€”Why an answer should always make me dance like a monkey at the Zoo, gibbering it over as I walk, & then re-writing, I dont know. It wasted a day. I suppose its all pure waste: yet if oneâ€™s an outsider, be an outsiderâ€”only dont for Godâ€™s sake attitudinise & take up the striking the becoming attitude.

We had a day in London. Oh, yes, Tom for the week end: more supple, less caked & rigid than of old. His teaching he told me, is that one improves with age. I suppose the working of the divine spirit which as usual he adored at 8 on Sunday morning, receiving communion from Mr Ebbsâ€”who did not impress him. The flat improved; a great thunderstorm; L. caught Louieâ€™s cold: had to stand about; a feverish cold: better now; but now its pouring; & owing to my impulsive idiocyâ€”saying I hoped to see himâ€”Eddy Sackville has imposed his petulance upon us for this week end. Shall I tell him so? or must impulsiveness be punished? But remember another time how people grasp at straws. And how I hate being a straw. Two days will be ruined, just at the climax. And weâ€™ve seen so many people; & these solitary days are so completely satisfactory. And if duty calls, its not to amuse young men with large country houses. Duty did not call me to listen to Mr Bradfield last night. Instead we listened to the ravings, the strangled hysterical sobbing swearing ranting of Hitler at the Beer Hall. The offer of mediationâ€”Holland & Belgiumâ€”is the fat on the fire. Today they say there was an explosion after heâ€™d left. Is it true? Theres no getting at truth now all the loud speakers are contradicting each other. Its a crosseyed squint, like the beams that make a tent over the church at night the searchlights meet there.

Mabel is here: pathetic to me in her dumb acceptance of snubs & all life is a snub to her. And now sheâ€™s ringing for lunch.
