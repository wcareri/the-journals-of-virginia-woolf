Once more, as so often, I hunt for my dear old red-covered book, with what an instinct Iâ€™m not quite sure. For what the point of making these notes is I dont know; save that it becomes a necessity to uncramp, & some of it may interest me later. But what? For I never reach the depths; Iâ€™m too surface blown. And always scribble before going inâ€”look quickly at my watch. Yes. 10 minutes leftâ€”what can I say. Nothing that needs thought: which is provoking; for I often think. And think the very thought I could write here. About being an outsider. About my defiance of professional decency. Another allusion of a tart kind to Mrs W. & her desire to kill reviewers in the Lit Sup. yesterday. Frank Swinnerton is the good boy, & Iâ€™m the bad little girl. And this is trivial. Compared with what? Oh the Graf Spee is going to steam out of Monte Video today into the jaws of death. And journalists & rich people are hiring aeroplanes from which to see the sight. This seems to me to bring war into a new angle; & our psychology. No time to work out. Anyhow the eyes of the whole world (BBC) are on the game; & several people will lie dead tonight, or in agony. And we shall have it served up for us as we sit over our logs this bitter winter night. And the British Captain has been given a KCB. & Horizon is out; & Louie has had her teeth out; & we ate too much hare pie last night; & I read Freud on Groups; & Iâ€™ve been titivating Roger: & this is the last page; & the year draws to an end; & weâ€™ve asked Plomer for Xmas; &â€”now times up as usual. Iâ€™m reading Ricketts diaryâ€”all about the war the last war; & the Herbert diaries & â€¦ yes, Dadieâ€™s Shakespeare, & notes overflow into my 2 books.
