### Thursday 13 April

Two days of influenza after that, mild but sucking oneâ€™s head as usual, so Iâ€™m out here this morning only to drone my way through a few Roger letters.

I finished my first 40 pagesâ€”childhood &câ€”well under the week; but then they were largely autobiography. Now politics impend. Chamâ berlainâ€™s statement in the House today. War I suppose not tomorrow, but nearer. Charleston to tea today. L. went to Brighton yesterday, & had a long talk with Miss Robins in bed, which was interesting, so Iâ€™m sorry I missed it, yet glad of solitude, such as it is here. If I could only embed myself for 10 days â€¦ I read about 100 pages of Dickens yesterday, & see something vague about the drama & fiction: how the emphasis, the caricature of these innumerable scenes, forever forming character, descend from the stage. Literatureâ€”that is the shading, suggesting, as of Henry James, hardly used. All bold & coloured. Rather monotonous, yet so abundant, so creative: yes: but not highly creative: not suggestive. Everything laid on the table. Nothing to engender in solitude. Thats why its so rapid & attractive: nothing to make one put the book down & think. But these are influenza musings; & Iâ€™m so muddled I shall take Sir Edward into the house & extract him over the fire. Weather now blackening a little, after 4 days full summer heatâ€”over 70. A Comma butterfly, sunning on the wall. L.â€™s rash improving. We live on macaroni.

Note: Lydiaâ€™s hostility to all married women.
