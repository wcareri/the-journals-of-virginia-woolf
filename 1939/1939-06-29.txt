### Thursday 29 June

The grind of doing Roger & PIP makes my head spin, & I let it reel itself off for 10 minutes here. I wonder why; & if I shall ever read this again. Perhaps if I go on with my memoirs, also a relief from R., I shall make use of it.

A dismal day yesterday; shoe hunting in that Hall of humbug, Fortnums. A Sale; but only of the unsaleable. And the atmosphere, British upper classes: all tight & red nailed; myself a figure of funâ€”whips my skin: I fidget: but recoup myself walking in the rain through the Parks. Come home & try to concentrate on Pascalâ€”I cant; still, its the only way of tuning up, & I get a calm if not understanding. These pin points of theology need a grasp beyond me. Still I see Lyttonâ€™s pointâ€”my dear old serpent. What a dream life is to be sureâ€”that he should be dead, & I reading him; & trying to make out that we indented ourselves on the world; whereas I sometimes feel its been an illusionâ€”gone so fast, lived so quickly; & nothing to show for it, save these little books. But that makes me dig my feet in, & squeeze the moment. So after dinner I walked to the Clinic with L.: waited outside with Sally tugging; watched the evening sight: oh & the purple grey clouds above Regents Park with the violet & yellow sky signs made me leap with pleasure.

Noise here very great. Even if we lose our rent, no doubt its worth itâ€”37 will be heavenly quiet. The letter war with Gollancz continuesâ€”more time frittered, wasted. L. very calm; & how sane, compared with me.
