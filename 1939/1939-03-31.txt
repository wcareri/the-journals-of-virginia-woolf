### Friday 31 March

Yes I made a phrase last night about bearing the panoply of life, & being glad to lay it down. I wonder if its true. After a worried domestic day; then L. had a temperature & went to bed; the Memoir Club was imminent. I felt I was bearing up the panoply of life & wd be glad to let it sink. I said to myself, Remember, this is the description of age coming. Iâ€™m on the qui vive to describe age: to note it. I often think of things in this way, but forget them. And as L. is normal & up & as its a fine morning, Iâ€™m not conscious of holding up my panoply, only distracted rather & cant settle in but must do R.â€™s Cambridge letters.

Clive read, truculently, with some motive I guess at the back of him, about R., amusing storiesâ€”â€œThe old creature was lying on a camp bed reading with a candle beside himâ€ this is the only touch I need to remember, at Charleston, at 1.30 in the morning. Said R. grew less magnanimous with age: reference to the NS. review, I expect. Nessa silent, disagreeing. Desmond did not come. Rang up. A rather scattered meeting.
