### Sunday 30 July

The great affair of the GH. has been settled amicably: a cold house at the back. So its over; what a waste of emotion. Is it that I lack will? For now Nessa bothers me about mantelpieces. Human voices wake us & we drown. Never been so free & happy; but human voices do wake one. Its fine; & our dayâ€™s varied with what we enjoy. Such an expansion after the London pressure. I take my brain out, & fill it with books, as a sponge with water. Miss Robinsâ€”Kilvertâ€”Gideâ€”cdnâ€™t read a word in London. Taking a day or two with PH. to rest myself from Roger. And have spun off a speech for Flavinda. Whether this book will ever compose, written thus at 3 month intervals, I doubt. But Iâ€™m all in favour of the wild, the experimental.
