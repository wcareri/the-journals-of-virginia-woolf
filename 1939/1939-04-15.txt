### Saturday 15 April

Its odd what extreme depression a little influenza & a cold in head produces. Happily Iâ€™m interested in depression; & make myself play a game of assembling the fractured piecesâ€”I mean I light a fire, & somehow dandle myself over it. Cooking is helpful. Oh but I was very down & dismal yesterday. And then noises & houses abuilding oppress: & thereâ€™s always our dear old warâ€”now postponed for a month. Sneezing & blowing is better than incubating germs.

Iâ€™ve done rather well at Roger considering: I dont think I shall take 2 weeks over each chapter. And its rather amusingâ€”dealing drastically with this years drudgery. I think I see how it shapes: & my compiling method was a good one. Perhaps its too like a novel. I dont bother. No letters; no news; & my head too stupid for reading. L. galloping through his book. I should like a holidayâ€”a few days in Franceâ€”or a run through the Cotswolds.

But considering how many things I have that I likeâ€”whats oddâ€”(Iâ€™m always beginning like this) is the severance that war seems to bring: everything becomes meaningless: cant plan: then there comes too the community feeling: all England thinking the same thingâ€”this horror of warâ€”at the same moment. Never felt it so strong before. Then the lull & one lapses again into private separationâ€”

But I must order macaroni from London.
