Whats the origin of the expression A flea in his ear?â€”thats what Iâ€™ve just written: & mustâ€”(12.15) switch from that to describe yesterday, Thursday: a very long day, but on the whole successfully accomplished. Not at all a nice morning, & worried by my speech, so I walked. And bought some frilling; & then off we went to the Polytechnic; & met a little brown faced supple man in corduroys; inspected a wall of illustrations to Oâ rlando & then in came, say 50 art students: blouses, shirts; nimble, young, inquisitive; stood up, & not very nervously spoke, improving, colloquially. Then L. gave his views; as a publisher. And that was a great successâ€”very valuable indeed, said the professor: & asked him to start again, which he did. No it wasnt formidable. It was rather cheerful. And free & easy. Better much than Oxford & Cambridge: which reminds me that Liverpool today offered me a Doctorâ€™s Degree; which I refused. Then they gave us a specimen book of rather too artistic printing; & then we got off. And I cooled myself with Chaucer. Then to dine at the studio, & a long, but on the whole, admirable & agreeable, Thursday evening. Rogers: 2 fat beavers, identical; artists; Spenders; Inez improving, independent sharp; Tangye Lean, the man with the absurd name who writes in the N. Chronicle; & Dermod MacCarthy; & L. in from The Cranium. I was pleased, vanitously, to find that Inez thinks me a poet-novelist, not a fraud; & T.L. also liked something or other. So we talked shop. The novel. They both incubate novels. He tears up. She has herâ€™s in a drawer. And my jadedness thawed. So that Iâ€™ve written several pages of P.H. although Miss Compton Burnett is praised.

Must face the end of Roger, perhaps at MH. this week end. A very fine June blue day at top of the skylight. But I meant to say that Nessaâ€™s conduct of these parties seemed to me admirable; & once she laughed, & laughed & laughed; trying to describe the prevalence of â€˜stuffâ€. I laughed too. Then we discussed tin: iron; & Dâ  who has his vein of queer humour, told us how Raymond Abbott said that organ pipes are pure tin. Mrs Rogers described the making of felt: & so on. Very easy, & sensible, & sympathetic. A great many parties in the offing. We have the materials for happiness again. A new Pope elected. A lull in the shindy. Poor Spiraâ€™s pictures all frauds. & a Labour P. meeting tonight.
