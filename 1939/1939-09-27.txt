### Wednesday 27 September

No Iâ€™m not sure of the date. And Vita is lunching here. Iâ€™m going to stop Râ oger at 12. Then read something real. Iâ€™m not going to let my brain addle. Little sharp notes. For somehow my brain is not very vigorous at the end of a book thoâ€™ I cd. dash off fiction or an article merrily enoâ€™. Why not relieve it then? Wasnt it my conscientious grind at The Years that killed it. So I whizz off to Stevensonâ€”Jekyll & Hydeâ€”not much to my liking. Very fine clear Sept weather windy but lovely light. And I cant form letters.
