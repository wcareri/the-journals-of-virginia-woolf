No, it was a good idea having Hugh alone. He gave me a full account of his sexual life, of which I retain these facts. He only loves men who dont love men. Tried to drown himself once over Melchior. Jumped into a river; stuck in mud; seized a carving knife; saw himself in the glass; all became absurd, reconciliation. Told me too of the Baths at the Elephant & Castle. How the men go there: saw Ld Câ  naked: saw Ld Bâ  in the act with a boy; later at the Beefsteak all medals. Has had a married life with Harold for 15 years without intercourse. All this piles up a rich life of wh. I have no knowledge: & he cant use it in his novels. They are therefore about lives he hasnt lived wh. explains their badness. Hasnt the courage to write about his real life. Would shock people he likes. Told me how he had had a father & son simultaneously. Copulation removes barriers. Class barriers fade. Lives at Hampstead with Haroldâ€™s family & friends completely naturally. All this is a great deal better than his literary talk. It led me to compare experience with thought. Apostles with phenomenons. Heâ€™s been at Rome writing daily articles for Hearst papers. We couldnâ€™t do this. Started making 2 or 3000 a year in 1912. Has supported Melchior & others. Saw, at any rate, another Hugh. Odd that heâ€™s never felt any feeling for women; but his sister is a suppressed Lesbian; & his brother entirely without sexâ€”a schoolmaster. This lasted from 4.30 to 7.30; without a break. And I liked him & enjoyed it, thoâ€™ crushed in the head.

I went to Highgate in the morning; saw the Whittington Stone & met 2 old women on Parliament Hill: each wore a cap of Turkish embroidery on her white straggly hair: very poor unkempt; big boots; black wrinkled stockings & a dog. One said Now if you dont come Peter I shall run away â€¦ they were hobbling. Curious vision of their extreme poverty, decrepitude, & the place played in their lives by Peter. How they fed him; & were identicalâ€”.. Still brain compressed: Memoir tonight. Mollyâ€™s operation over, apparently successful. Desmond with a bad cold; Clive to read. So thats all, & Iâ€™m fiddling again with Roger.
