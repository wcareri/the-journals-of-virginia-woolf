Vita came to a late lunch; Mrs Woolf fell down & broke 2 ribs; Tom brought Mr Morley to tea â€¦ These are the elements upon which yesterday was founded. with Vita. Home. Change. Talk. Telephone. L. to the nursing home after dinner. She will not die, so I assume. There is a terrible passive resistance to death in these old women. They have the immortality of the vampire. Poor Flora will be sucked drop by drop for years to come. This is I suppose a cruel remark to make. But honestly, everyone would be relieved if she could make an end of it. Its so exhausting, & as Flora said, she has contrived to falsify all emotions, till the end is the only thing the family who are forced to be so devoted by her fantasy honestly wish for. And now John to lunch. After wh. can I escape to buy some shoes, & ought I to buy shoes with the flat still to let? Iâ€™ve said Iâ€™ll write an article on Royalty for PP. for Â£25 by way of a sop to our income & our liabilities.
