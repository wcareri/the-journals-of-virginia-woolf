### Monday 3 July

L.â€™s mother died last night. And its been jading & somehow very depressingâ€”watching her die. She gradually ceased to breathe. There were 3 days though of going thereâ€”sitting in the alcove in that long corridor. Flora sat with her. Sometimes she talked. L. found her cheerful one night. Virginia must write a book called â€œThe fallen woman.â€ I remember that; out of a litter of odds & ends, because it was the last time she spoke of me. It was like watching an animal die, L. said. Rau burst into tears. She wanted to live, asked the matron if she had known an old woman recover, asked Rau. Both of course said Yes. Last night, as Flora, Edgar & Harold were dining here off cold chicken, Herbert rang up to say it was critical; & she had just died when they got there. Her breathing, as Rau said it would, stopped. And then they decided that her wishâ€”to be taken to a private home, not left in the mortuary, must be gratified: so the body is taken to Laleham today: then will go to the Jewish Cemetery. A watcher came from the Synagogue. It was a bright, showery day. We walked in Regents Park, after giving Kingsley Martin lunch. I always notice the weather in which people die, as if the soul would notice if its wet or windy. Then, when L. had come back, we went round to Cliveâ€™s: found Nessa interviewing Lottie; & talked about doctors & skin diseases with Clive & Duncan.

But I cannot do my Royalty article, & have a regret for that spirited old lady, whom it was such a bore to visit. Still she was somebody: sitting on her high backed chair with the pink cushion, all the flowers round her, a cigar always for Leonard, & plates of cakes which she pressed us to eat. Last timeâ€”Saturday weekâ€”she was peevish & querulous. It was about not seeing Herbert as usual. Children no longer respected their parents. And she got up & fell back. But these feelings are mixed, scrappy, & Iâ€™m in the scraped state when writing dont work.
