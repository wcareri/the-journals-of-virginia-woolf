### Tuesday 17 January

London on Sunday. Five minutes left of the morning. Yesterday I went to the London Library; thought Iâ€™d been there for 40 years; read Tomâ€™s swan song in the Criterion, or rather slipped his condensed meanings over my fluid mind; home & read Delacroix journals; about which I could write: I mean the idea that its among the painters not the writers one finds stability, consolation. This refers to a sentence of his about the profundity of the painterâ€™s meaning; & how a writer always superficialises.

I wish I could distill some of my thoughts about â€œthe situationâ€ into nuggets. The Spanish war is being won yesterday today tomorrow by Franco. I dreamt of Julian. A sniping article on him â€œThe limitations of Bloomsburyâ€ by Janet Adam Smith. She advises life in a mining village as a remedy: what is her practice? This represents a vein of thought that I may work out. Igor has bought a motor carâ€”out of my Â£150? Another vein of thought with which I struggle. The purification of the soul. This is a fact, however: my struggle. Todayâ€”dreary wetâ€”I may go to Mathew Smithâ€™s pictures; or may not. John comes. Question of our relations with John.

At Cliveâ€™s on Sunday. A good discussion of painting & music. Janice gave tongue. Angelica sang a song. L. talked. So did Nessa.

Iâ€™m taking 4 days holiday from Roger, writing Pâ ointz Hâ all, the Barn scene. Iâ€™ve learnt something from The Yearsâ€”just translated into French.

Now the clock strikes one.
