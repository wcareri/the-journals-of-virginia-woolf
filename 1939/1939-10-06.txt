Well, I have succeeded in despite of distractions to belong to other nations in copying out again the whole of Roger. Needless to say, its still to be revised, compacted, vitalised. And can I ever do it? The distractions are so incessant. Today Iâ€™m asked to take on Bunnyâ€™s job on the N.S. Yes Iâ€™ve been slipping into the frying pan of journalismâ€”letting myself in for a monthly article, making, or attempting to make, Â£15.15 terms. All this is very frittering, exciting, degrading. And shivers my detachment. Also theres the war: or rather the non-war. Nothing happens. All is held up. Nightly weâ€™re served out with a few facts, or a childstory of the adventures of a submarine. Hitler is said to make peace terms today. London is all agog; & also all a quiver. Raymond wrote me an SOS letter; describing the whirlpoolâ€”round round roundâ€”twigs, old curling paper & bits of strawâ€”at the NS Office. Shaw writes an article; Maynard has a heart attack over it; KM. an attack of hysteria. Stonier is stony. Poor RM. prays for help from Leonard, even from me. Here its distracted weatherâ€”hailstorms & gales & sun; Nessa is painting L.: & theres a centre of rustic simplicityâ€”old Botten picking up the walnuts & burbling on & I sitting on Kingston Hill & watching the destroying clouds point like a great feathered grey blue wing over the channel. Suddenly rain bursts & I dash home: a great evening, & bowls with L. Iâ€™m beaten. I compose articles on Lewis Carroll & read a great variety of booksâ€”Flaubertâ€™s life, R.â€™s lectures, out at last, a life of Erasmus & Jacques Blanche. We are asked to lunch with Mrs Webb, who so often talks of us. And my hand seems as tremulous as an aspen. I have composed myself by tidying my room.

Cant quite see ray way now as to the next step in composition. Tom this week end.

I meant to record a Third Class Railway carriage conversation. The talk of business men. Their male detached lives. All politics. Deliberate, well set up, contemptuous & indifferent to the feminine. For example: one man hands the E. Standard, points to a womans photograph. â€œWomen? Let her go home & bowl her hoopâ€ said the man in blue serge with one smashed eye. â€œSheâ€™s a drag on himâ€ another fragment. The son is going to lectures every night. Odd to look into this cool manâ€™s world: so weather tight: insurance clerks all on top of their work; sealed up; self sufficient; admirable; caustic; laconic; objective; & completely provided for. Yet thin, sensitive: yet schoolboys: yet men who earn their livings. In the early train they said, â€œCant think how people have time to go to war. It must be that the blokes havenâ€™t got jobs.â€ â€œI prefer a fools paradise to a real hell.â€ â€œWarâ€™s lunacy. Mr Hitler & his set are gangsters. Like Al Caponeâ€. Not a chink through which one can see art, or books. They play cross words when insurance shop fails.
