### Monday 9 January

Now that I have brought my brain to the state of an old washerwomans flannel over Rogerâ€”Lord the Josette chapterâ€”& its all too detailed, too tied downâ€”I must expand, first on this irresponsible page, & then, for 4 days I swear, before we go back on Sunday, in fiction. Though Iâ€™ve ground out most wish to write, even fiction. Rodmell is a grind on the brain: in winter especially. I write 3 solid hours: walk 2: then we read, with intervals for cooking dinner, music, news, till 11.30. Iâ€™ve thus read L.â€™s second volume: very good; full; moulded; subtle; & ever so many packets of R.â€™s letters; & some SevignÃ©, Chaucerâ€”& some nonsense books. Weather now broken. Floods & gales; marsh under water. Charleston broken up. Maynardâ€™s father dying.

And that reminds me of 2 obituaries I should have written, had I not been immersed: Jack Hills & Mitz. Mitz was found dead on Boxing day I think: her white old womans face puckered; eyes shut; tail wrapped round her neck. L. buried her in the snow under the wall. Jack died the same day aboutâ€”no Xmas Eve: & if I had a brain (but havent) I could retell his life; as it affected ours, 30 years ago. The last time I saw him was in the London Library a year ago: grown stout & rosy; I heard his odd stammer: was too shy to speak. He was talking to a lady about a visit they had paid togetherâ€”a sign of his unknown life. For who he saw, where he lived even had long been lost to me. Yet of all our youthful directors he was the most open minded, least repressive, could best have fitted in with later developments, had we not gone our waysâ€”he to politics & sport, we to Bloomsbury. I remember his address to me in Fitzroy Square after Vâ 's marriage on the sexual life of young men. Can they be honourable? I askedâ€”when he said how all male talk was about women; how every young man had his whore. He was amused. I remember the moonlight night at Hindhead: the tramp: the shadows in the garden; Stella & he in the summer house; Thoby shouting at the tramp. Sophie confirms this: the tramp looked in at the kitchen window, where she sat getting a meal for Mr George. And then Stellaâ€™s death, one year later, & how he came round & sat with me, & talked in his natural voice. And then those appalling evenings at Painswick, sitting with him in a summer house, after dinner; he grasping my hand in agony: torn asunderâ€”you cant understandâ€”& I fixing a small bush & making it a symbol of agony. Then the long interviews with Nessa: her love; the row with George. â€œAre they going to get married?â€â€”how he burst in on me & rather brutally told me his suspicion; asked me to speak to herâ€”to warn her. I remember her dignified reproachâ€”â€œYou too?â€ And fatherâ€™s sense. â€œIf she wants to I wont interfere.â€ Then he fell in love, with Elena; with Imogen. A letter from Italy: â€œNever think that Iâ€™ve forgotten Stella, thoâ€™ Iâ€™ve loved other womenâ€â€”& so the dispersal, the very casual meetings; his marriage; & the end. This sketch must serve, since Iâ€™m too jaded to write.
