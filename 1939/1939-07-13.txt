### Thursday 13 July

A bad morning. All fiddling again. Because I woke worriedâ€”about what? L.â€™s gloom: not lifting this; I dont know what; & lit up & read MacColl & started the machine running. And so am numb headed. What a head to work withâ€”never again a long book. And no walk. 2 hours at Mâ ecklenburghâ  Sâ quare planning, electric light kitchen &c. The practical difficulty appalsâ€”all our books carpets furniture & L. gloomy. This is all surface gloom though. A grim thought struck me: wh. of these rooms shall I die in? Which is going to be the scene of someâ€”oh no, I wont write out the tragedy that has to be acted there. A free man thinks of nothing &c. So I read Pascal & Pater & wrote letters & cooked dinner & did my embroidery. But couldnt sleep sound.
