### Wednesday 12 July

For the first time for weeks, after being so damnably down in the mouth yesterday, Iâ€™ve worked with some pleasure at R. The new Omega chapter. I might still pull it through. Yet how dumpish we wereâ€”starting off to the Movies, after dinnerâ€”L. asking me what I wanted to see, I not wanting to see anythingâ€”the crowds of deformed & stunted & vicious & sweating & ugly hooligans & harridans in the Tott. Ct. Roadâ€”the sticky heatâ€”all this brooded, till I was saying, step out, on, on, in my usual desperate way. Then instead we went to Nessaâ€™s. A in bed. Clive there: Duncan bubbling. I read Philipâ€™s letter about L.â€™s Latin epitaph & we had a good laugh & gossip. P. has denounced Duncanâ€™s portrait. I think a fine one. Wants a jolly girl; instead of this black frump. Mrs Gertler had been round to Pip at midnight with her guitar. P. looked out of the window & refused it. This is in the old Bâ loomsbury manner. P. in his nightcap, vagrant & vagulous. Duncan pobbling his words. Couldnâ€™t remember Lady David Cecil, who has been arrestedâ€”no threatened. Burbling on about a book by a clergyman bought in Berwick Church. V. very silent, worried I suppose: yet â€˜cheerfulâ€™ too. She will laugh & take part, even if she sinks again. Queer horror of seeing her exert herself. Perhaps I exaggerate. Julian in the background. Oh dearâ€”why waste all that? But a jovial sunny evening that rolled off my glooms effectively; perhaps L.â€™s. Its not a nice season in London. To 37 this afternoon.

Now my mind is running on R. a good sign, at p. 230, so thatâ€™s more than half.
