### Thursday 5 January

So I take a new nib, after bringing Roger to the verge of Josette with the old one, & spend my last 5 minutes, this very fine January morning, in writing the first page of the new Year. Last 5 minutes before lunchâ€”how inaugurate this important volume in that time, with this brain? A brain still running in the rut of the last sentence, which last sentence will be re-written a dozen times, too. So the dominant theme is work: Roger: the others the usual Rodmell themes. That is, Iâ€™ve let the frost go too far away. We came down 14 or 15 days ago & found all pipes frozen. There was snow for 5 daysâ€”bitter cold; wind. We staggered for one hour through the blizzard. Chains were on our wheels. We ground over to Charleston & Tilton on Christmas day. Then, 2 days later, woke to find green grass everywhere. The long spikes of ice that hung down the kitchen window had drops on their noses. They melted. The pipes thawed. Now its a June morning with an east wind. And times up. But the bookâ€™s begun anyhow. And perhaps I shall get a clearer head & say 10 minutes tomorrow. To Alciston yesterday, & envied the view & the farmhouse. But L. says â€œI prefer Monks Houseâ€ Walked in Firle Park. At sight of that great yellow white mansion, L. said, â€œI prefer Monks House.â€ So to lunch.
