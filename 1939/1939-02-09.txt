### Thursday 9 February

Too tired even to fold up Nessaâ€™s Berlin letters. This tiredness was bred of 8 hours incessant talk after four days incessant sun. That was our 4 days at MH. So people accumulate. Eth Bowen, Sean Oâ€™Faolain, Busch concert.

Looking at my old Greek diary I was led to speculate. I extract only this: that I wonâ€™t budge from the scheme there (1932) laid down for treating decline of fame. To accept; then ignore; & always venture further. Obviously there are no limits unless one submits. Always shave off the expected, dictated attitude; & find whats under it. But I cant even write this plain. And Molly â€¦ But we go to Crufts dog show: fine again.
