### Wednesday 30 August

Not at war yet. Parâ liament met: yesterday. Negotiations. We are firm. A pause. L. & I discussing the Broadcast are up & down. Very blackâ€”then less so. L. pessimistic more than I am this morning. He thinks that Hâ itler.is making up his mind to spring. Raging voices began again last night in German. Last years mad voice heard again, as if he were lashing himself up. At the same time, a reply of 8 pages has been sent last night to the Cabinet. The French are out of it this time.

Iâ€™m dull headed. Spreading my mind out to synthesise the last chapter. Well, its a good thing as a distraction. Also wrote a synopsis of a story for Chabrun. Will they really order 3,000 words on that flimsy sketch for Â£200? Seems impossible. Nobody keeps engagements or answers letters. A kind of block & suspension. No furniture unpacked. We go up tomorrow.

Brilliantâ€”yes, the light is very evanescentâ€”shiningâ€”weather. Very hot. To Lewes about shoes &c. All the tradespeople one wd say indifferent. Question of buying bicycles. Lots of bicycles. But why? Oh dâ€™you think thereâ€™ll be a war?

Now I must listen to the one â€™clock.

Red faced boys in khaki guarding Rodmell Hill. The soldiers in the village. Otherwise quiet & usual enoâ€™â€¦
