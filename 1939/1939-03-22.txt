Tom sent me his play, Family Reunion. No, it dont do. I read it over the week end. It starts theories. But no â€¦ You see the experiment with stylised chatter isnt successful. Heâ€™s a lyric not a dramatic. But here theres no free lyricism, is caught back by the character: has no power to embody: as stiff as pokers. And the chief poker is Tom: but cant speak out. A cold upright poker. And the Fates behind the drawing room curtain. A clever beginning, & some ideas; but they spin out: & nothing grips: all mistâ€”a failure: a proof hes not a dramatist. A monologist. This is stated very politely by the papers this morning. The News not so politely. We go on Thursday. Iâ€™m of course for reasons I canâ€™t go into selfishly relieved: why? Had it been a success would it have somehow sealedâ€”my ideas? does this failure confirm a new idea of mineâ€”that Iâ€™m evolving in PH about the drama? Or is it jealousy? & then theres L.â€™s play. A mixture of motives â€¦

Very fine at the moment; & alone; & confronted with a dress maker; & L. all rash. Rau says it will go in time. Reading Eddie Marsh. Finished the 18th cent scene in PH. Odd how freely & happily I dash that off. Roger put aside. No, I cant write here. Politics lulled: but Kingsley vocal on the phone. An account of Ly Astorâ€™s lunch party.
