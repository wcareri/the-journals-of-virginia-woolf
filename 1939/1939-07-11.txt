### Tuesday 11 July

Interrupted by a man to look over the Studio. Would take the place at once, if he could have it for 6 years. Thats the end of all these visits. Back from MH. & crossâ€”to use the nurses word. Cross at my waste of time over PIPs, doubtful about the bookâ€”angry at the immense drudgery. Still I must get on. Q. for the weekendâ€”oh that we could ever be wholly alone: & yet I dont want to be wholly alone. The usual fight between solitude & society, scarcely worth noting, let alone dissecting. Very fine July weather. And is Charles blind? And am I to buy a new dress? And what aboutâ€”I think the true proportions are better in the country. Over all hangs war of course. A kind of perceptible but anonymous friction. Dantzig. The Poles vibrating in my room. Everything uncertain. We have got into the habit however. Work, work, I tell myself.
