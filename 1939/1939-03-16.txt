### Thursday 16 March

Jack I see in this mornings paper left Â£3,000 only. I see too that Hitler has marched into Prague. This, says the PM. â€œis not in the spirit of the Munich meetingâ€. My comment anyhow is superfluous. We sit & watch. Yesterday in Bond Street where I finally did lay out Â£10 on clothes, I saw a crowd round a car, & on the back seat was a Cheetah with a chain round his loins. I also found a presentation copy of Tomâ€™s Family Reunion; & sucked no pleasure from the first pages. Yet I enjoyed Chaucer, Michelet & Me. de SevignÃ©. I reserve judgment. The night before Mrs Klein dinedâ€”the backwash of my Pâ sycho Aâ nalystsâ€™ partyâ€”unrecorded? A woman of character & force & some submergedâ€”how shall I sayâ€”not craft, but subtlety: something working underground. A pull, a twist, like an undertow: menacing. A bluff grey haired lady, with large bright imaginative eyes.

It was on the tip of my penâ€”only I had to writeâ€”to re-write Rogerâ€”to record, in brief form, Lunch with Lady Diana Cooper costs 3/6. Yes, for some impulse of my own, I said I would lunch to meet old Ethel. Old Ethel very deaf. So as to impress the aristocracy who arenâ€™t ever impressed, I took a 1/- cab from Hyde Pk Corner: & Chapel Street was only one step down the road. Curious, the feebleness of the aristocracy in the eye line. Diana has inherited a vast houseâ€”sat in a drawing room like the floor of a shop: was furnishingâ€”Chinâ tzes piled up. A glass room, looking on to the D. of Westminsterâ€™s great wallâ€”he has a private tennis court. Dishevelled creepers hang down. This great house is so timidly faced. The tinted mask of the late Duchess in a glass case. Rex Whistler discreet amusing fakes of 18th Century decorationâ€”all diluted, reminiscent. And then Duffâ€™s great library, that might have done for Lord Acton or Lord Macaulayâ€”here Rex again at work, fabricating 18th Century. Praise of Sargent. Praise of the late Duchesses tomb at the Tate. The usual space & simplicity. Many little dishes. Many concoctions. But empty & full of unsaturated possessions. â€œI dont like possessionsâ€ said D. She has a bedroom like a shop again. On the table a 6d Penguin. Rooms for Madame de Maintenon, Montespan &c. Only Diana, all niceness, goodness, with that free sweep that I like in the aristocracy: putting on Ethelâ€™s 3 cornered hat (wh. became her) as if they were free, but had nowhere to go. Talk trumpeted, emphatic, difficult, about Maurice Baring. Little rough haired boy came in. So I drove Ethel to Waterloo & paid 2/6 & was then too cold in my finery to walk, so home. Refused lunch with Harry at the Athenaeum.

Iâ€™m thinking of a critical book. Suppose I used the diary form? Would this make one free to go from book to bookâ€”or wd it be too personal? I might take some fribble, like Peter Opie: so to Sevigne &c. But I must let it simmer.

A blessed space of quiet todayâ€”tea with Nessa; then alone tonight; MH. this weekend, & my new green linen waterproof. L.â€™s back improving. Rau talks of an allergic doctor, who discovers sensibilities; but Rau does not ring up.
