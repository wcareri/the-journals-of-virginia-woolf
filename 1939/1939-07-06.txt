### Thursday 6 July

â€œLadyâ€ to call her by the name she liked to explainâ€”she always talked about the past bestâ€”was buried yesterday; & there was a service in the Synagogue. Women admitted, so I went. But its a compromise; & had nothing whatever to do with â€œLadyâ€. What was she like then? Let me seeâ€”She was small, narrow shoulderedâ€”things slipped offâ€”she wore a low blouse with a pearl necklaceâ€”& rather heavy. Her head nodded. She had stiff curled grey black hair. She would say as we came in â€œAnd Virginia?â€ My joke was, Conceal your disappointment at sight of me. Then she would laugh, kiss me, & give me a little pat. We were on friendly laughing terms, always at the same stock joke, which carried us through those 2 hour teas. â€œAnd tell me what you have been doing?â€ I would have some story ready. She liked hearing about Ann & Judith: not much interested in any other relations of mine. For many years we never reached even this intimacy. I think she suspected me of not being family. She came over to see us of course. And how often we drove to Worthing! It was trumped up mostly. Yet there was something spontaneous about her. A great joy in family; in society; she could make friends out of anyone: was very popular with elderly gentlemen. One at Worthing stood her dinners, took her to the theatre. She liked telling the story of plays. She would tell the whole plot of Gone with the Wind for example; talking as if they were real: a trait odd to me in so shrewd a woman; for she had as she was often boasting, brought up 9 children. Never went to bed, she said, without a basket of socks by her side. All was personal. And the ruts of course became deeper; one knew what would come next. Sometimes thoâ€™ she made me feel the daughter emotionâ€”when I kissed her when Clara died. She attaches to nothing in my own life: except the comment she made; that she was the â€˜elder generationâ€™: & I (now the elder, to most people) was the younger. I never saw her save in her own surroundings. These were fussy, yes, but full of stir: always presents of flowers: childrenâ€™s letters: What news of Bella & Tom? Where is Phil going for his holiday? She was the centre of that net work & until Edgar & Flora disabused me, I thought they depended on it. Perhaps, when the freedom is over, they will miss it. â€œBelâ€â€”the day of whose retirement in Marchâ€”poor old ladyâ€”was the â€œday I count the days to itâ€¦â€ so she said last Saturday weekâ€”Bel cabled a silly effusion wh. makes their relation look artificial. The truth was, age had taken everything away that was real, I think: only age left the pathetic animal, which was very real; the body that wanted to live. I know nothing of any interest about her, now that I come to write, only little anecdotes, about Holland: nothing that makes her a real personâ€”save Is Virginia coming? which touches me.
