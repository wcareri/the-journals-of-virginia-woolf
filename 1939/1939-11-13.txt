### Monday 13 November

Monday morning after a week end is a wash out. I cannot re write R.â€™s last page. Thats laid to the account of Eddy. He was on guard against egotism, & was spry & bonnyâ  enoâ€™; but I walked 7 miles alone to Charleston & suffer for it (as Nurse Lugton used to say). Today restless & unidead. Its a good shake up no doubt; but I wanted peace. I must devise a plan for evading the after book gloom. My flutter in the NS was a fritter. I had a letter of abuse in the TLS so I must dig myself in. Indeed I dont see why I should poke my head out again for a very long time. Iâ€™ve done my duty as an outsider for some months. And I suppose have only made myself more unpopular: ah yes: but freer. Thats the point. Never again shall I be asked to write for the TLS: thats a gain.

Mabel goes back on Wednesday; & we revert to the old happy obscurity with Louie. Save for Robson & A. & Qâ€¦. but they dont count.
