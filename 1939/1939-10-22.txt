### Sunday 22 October

Oh let me fly from Roger to a page of a very different sort. We have spent a week in London. The poster read, at Wimbledon: â€œThe War begins â€¦ Hitler says, Now its onâ€. So as we drove to M.S. I said â€œIts foolish to come to London the first day of war.â€ It seemed as if we were driving open eyed into a trap. The trap feeling was strong those first days. I kept one ear pricked. The flat was oh in such a messâ€”very small, very crowded. Whistles sounded. The dark was as thick as Hell. One seemed cut off. No wireless. There we sat. And people came running in & out. The Arnold Fosters: Tom: Stephen: John: we lunched with the Webbs. I recover; old age means an accumulation of the past. Like Wells oneâ€™s obsessed; or like Shaw scatter brained. The old woman, wearing a white spotted headdress, was as alive as a leaf on an autumn bonfire: burning, skeletonised. I was, & am, no not so much now, so harassed & distracted, with the trap on me, that I could not expand my mind to receive impressions.

You never escape the war in London. People are all thinking the same thing. All set on getting the dayâ€™s work done. Hitches & difficulties hold one up. Very few buses. Tubes closed. No children. No loitering. Everyone humped with a gas mask. Strain & grimness. At night its so verdurous & gloomy that one expects a badger or a fox to prowl along the pavement. A reversion to the middle ages with all the space & the silence of the country set in this forest of black houses. A torch blinks. An old gentleman revealed. He vanishes. That red light may be a taxi or a lampost. People grope their way to each others lairs. We were talking in our lair about 6 hours daily. Great caterpillars dug up the square. Gradually the sense of siege being normal replaced the fearâ€”the individual fear. My ears were not pricked. It was irritating & oneâ€™s temper was rubbed. This was increased by the sheer discomfort & perpetual need for clearing drawers, arranging furniture. The kitchen very small. Everything too large. Stairs bad. No carpets. The clerks scream like parrots. Miss Woodward left in torrents of tears. Rain pouredâ€”profuse unbridled mediaeval rain. I wrote & rewrote in barren horror Lewis Carrollâ€”my hands & feet cold. Did nothingâ€”was indeed in fretful useless distraction. Sally was paralysed. L. had her rib plastered. So we came down & the world rises out of dark squalor into this divine natural peace. My brain is smoothing already, in spite of A. & Q. yesterday. Alone today & for many days. It was an odd morbid week of many disagreeable sensations.
