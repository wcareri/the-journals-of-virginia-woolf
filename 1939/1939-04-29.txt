But what are the interesting things? Iâ€™m thinking of what I should like to read here in 10 years time. And Iâ€™m all at sea. Perhaps literal facts. The annal, not the novel. Yesterday I went out in a fur coat, for it was bitter cold, to walk in London. I stopped by the Savoy Church: there were photographers. Soon the Bride arrived. The car glided onâ ; there were too many cars behind. Mother & small page arrived: 2 girls in absurd little boat hats. They helped the Bride with her veil. â€œCan you get it over my bouquet?â€ she askedâ€”very gay; rather red; very slim. Husband & best man waiting in grey trousers & cutaway coats. Old sitters in the sun watching. Camera men. A little processionâ€”rather skimpy & cold & not very rich I thought. The old manâ€”my ageâ€”had shabby boots. Shaven, brushed, red, thin. They are Mr Sholto Douglas Barnes, & Miss Marjorie Berkeley, daughter of a deceased ICS Colonelâ€”so I learn today. Then I walked along the Embankment, up into the fur quarter behind Blackfriars. Men in white coats aparelled in silver fur skins. A smell of fur. Found some old City Company houses. One the Inn Keepers Company. Also a green plant bursting out of a factory. Also one of the usual 18th Century mansions tucked away. So into Cannon St. Bought a paper with Hitlerâ€™s speech. Read it on top of Bus. Inconclusiveâ€”cut up in Stop Press. Everyone reading itâ€”even newspaper sellers, a great proof of interest. So to Kingsway. Bought some folders. Failed to buy a guide to Cotswolds. L. had 4 gents to discuss Sir John Maynardâ€™s memo. Read Chaucer. Enjoyed it. Was warm & happy not to go to Sadlers Wells. Nessa rang up. Bed.
