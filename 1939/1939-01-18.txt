It is undoubtedly a great freshener to have my story taken by Harperâ€™s. I heard this morning. A beautiful story, enchanted to have it. 600 dollars made then. Therefore I am paying off Helenâ€™s money, as I said I would. But the encouragement, I must note, by way of ruffling my theories that one should do without encouragement, is a warmer, a reviver. I cant deny it. I was, perhaps partly on that account, in full flood this morning with P.H. I think I have got at a more direct method of summarising relations; & then the poems (in metre) run off the prose lyric vein, which, as I agree with Roger, I overdo. That was by the way the best criticism Iâ€™ve had for a long time: that I poetise my inanimate scenes, stress my personality; dont let the meaning emerge from the matiÃ¨reâ€”Certainly I owed Roger

I went to Herâ tford House in the yellow rain yesterday & saw Bodington and Bumalfaccoâ€”no thats not the nameâ€”a little bit of verification for the book to which I must turn tomorrow. Next pages are about R.â€™s politics. Now dont, because Adam Smith gibes, apologise, for sheâ€™s not worth a nail on Rogerâ€™s toe.

John to teaâ€”depressed. He & L. never alluded to their exchange of abuse. But I thought him rather worn down. I am not yet up in London politics. One of our lulls. We are still away to our friends; but I must see Mela Spira the refugee Austrian Jewess; & today Mrs Woolfâ€”the blanks will fill. I am going walking & adventuring going to see pictures of an afternoon; & often come face to face, after tea, at odd moments, with the idea of death & age. Why not change the idea of death into an exciting experience?â€”as one did marriage in youth? Age is baffled today by my creative giftâ€”still a bubble. And then the steady passion with which I now read â€¦ A rainy day. Rain real wet drops: white splashing from the road. I must somehow ease my way back into Rogerâ€”shut PH firmly; my mind full of figuresâ€”Isa in the greenhouseâ€”to be put in their boxes.
