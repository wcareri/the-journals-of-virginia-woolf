### Saturday 2 December

Tiredness & dejection give way if one day off is taken instantly. I went in & did my cushion. In the evening my pain in my head calmed. Ideas came back. This is a hint to be remembered. Always turn the pillow. Then I become a swarm of ideas. Only I must hive them till R. is done. It was annoying to get on to the surface & be so stung with my pamphlet. No more controversy for a year, I vow. Ideas: about writers duty. No, Iâ€™ll shelve that. Began reading Freud last night; to enlarge the circumference, to give my brain a wider scope: to make it objective; to get outside. Thus defeat the shrinkage of age. Always take on new things. Break the rhythm &c. Use this page, now & then, for notes. Only they escape after the mornings grind.

L.â€™s book out and noticed at length. I forgot to note our very interesting talk about detachment at 37 tâ€™other night. L. has trained himself to cut adrift completely from personal feelings: its common sense, because one has no real identity there: & losing it gives one the only happiness thats secure. Yes. to learn to discuss say ones work eliminating oneself. This is quite trueâ€”one gets it now & againâ€”an astonishing freedom & expansion. L. very subtle & wise: & down here its made easier, owing to the open country. I saw a Kingfisher & a cormorant the other days walk in rubber boots. Planes very active. Russia attacking Finland. Nothing happens in England. Theres no reason anywhere. Brutes merely rampant. This suspends oneâ€™s judgment: makes it foolish even to discuss. Its like being in a temporary shelter with a violent storm raging outside. We wait. L.P. meeting here. Great diversity & freedom among the villagers.

Oh & my memoir will have to be compacted. And no letters. And the legacy may be Â£7 or 800. We go to 37 for 2 nights next week, & I see Ethel & Shena Simon. This life here has now become the rule; tâ€™other the exception.
