Iâ€™ve done a Â¼â€”100 pages of Rogerâ€”well I shall have by tomorrow. As there are 400 pages, & one hundred takes 3 weeks (oh but I was interrupted)â€”it will take 9 weeks to finish. Yes, I ought to have finished it by the end of Julyâ€”only we may go away. Say August. And have it all typed in Septemberâ€¦. Wellâ€”then it will be out this time next year. And I shall be free in Augustâ€”What a grind it is; & I suppose of little interest except to six or seven people. And I shall be abused.
