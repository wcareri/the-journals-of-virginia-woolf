### Wednesday 29 November

A nice dine & sleep visit from John, who pans out well under familiar scrutinyâ€”dining in the kitchen &câ€”& things arenâ€™t doing badly: in fact stirring under the blanket of war. Rosinski sells: L. slowly. Ideas sprout. For a Bloomsbury Book Club â€¦ for â€˜ourâ€™ new magazine; I mean a revival of Nâ ew Writing: to which Rosamund has sent a long story. Yes, the young do manage to pull along. Iâ€™m never to have a good review again. The Spec vicious, John says. And a long gossip â€¦ bed wetting at Eton; its disastrous consequences. Repressionsâ€”homosexuality: this explains, I suppose, Johnâ€™s dash. One odd thing about the war is the failure of the post. No letters. John gets garrulous after wine. He cant make it up with Stephen. Stephen half lies about Horizon & his part in it mostly. Offers to bring it to the Hog. Steals young writers &c. I think its an emotional crux.

Wind & rain. Again, after a screw at articles, screwing at R. Withers says do I want stock or cash? L. says cash. How much? I have only 2 minutes left. I think I shall write a Monday Tuesday for N.W. No more long laboured articles at the moment. J. enthusiastic about Bs at Gate, which is out tomorrow. So I take a back place. Now I dont mind that. Should I, 20 years ago? J. says my Râ eviewing pâ amphlet very interesting: couldnt be said by the young. Part of my Outsider Campaign. A letter from Shena Simon referring to 3 Gs.
