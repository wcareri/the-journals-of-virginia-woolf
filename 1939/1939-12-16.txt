### Saturday 16 December

The litter in this room is so appalling that it takes me 5 minutes to find my pen. R. all unsewn in bits. And I must take 50 pages, should be 100, up on Monday. Cant get the marriage chapter right. Proportion all wrong. Alteration, quotation, makes it worse. But its true I dont fuss quite so much as over a novel. I learned a lesson in re-writing The Years wh. I shall never forget. Always I say to myself Remember the horror of that. Yesterday I was, I suppose unnecessarilyâ , cheerful. 2 letters from admirers of 3 Gs; both genuine: one a soldier in the trenches; the other a distracted middle-class woman at Yeovil. And a letter which I must now answer from Stephen, asking me to contribute â€œOn the Youngâ€ or anything to Horizon. No no. Still at war, he says, with John. If I write for glory its to be in our own paper.

Bought rubber boots yesterday. Met Lydia. Slapped her shoes on counter â€œHugh Walpoleâ€”Priestlyâ€”tell Leonardâ€”gossipâ€”catching busâ€”offâ€. Roars of laughter in the shop. I explained her celebrity. L. bought a new mackintosh.

Horizon out; small; trivial, dull. So I think from not reading it. And nowâ€”oh now must I tidy up? London, the Hutchinsons &c looms. And Iâ€™ve promised to lecture the WEA at Brighton. And to write for the Forum.
