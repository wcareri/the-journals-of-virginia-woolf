### Monday 28 August

I stay out here, after bowls, to sayâ€”what? on this possibly last night of peace. Will the 9 oâ€™clock bulletin end it all?â€”our lives, oh yes, & everything for the next 50 years? Everyoneâ€™s writing I suppose about this last day. I walked on the downs; lay under a cornstack & looked at the empty land & the pinkish clouds in a perfect blue summer afternoon sky. Not a sound. Workmen discussing war on the roadâ€”one for it, one against. So to bowls. I bowling am happy: I outside the garden what? Numb I think. Vita says she feels terror & horror earlyâ€”revives then sinks. For us its like being on a small island. Neither of us has any physical fear. Why should we? But theres a vast calm cold gloom. And the strain. Like waiting a doctors verdict. And the youngâ€”young men smashed up. But the point is one is too numbed to think. London seemed cheery. Most people are numb & have a surface optimism. Hugh Slater yesterday, has an instinct that there wont be war. Old Clive sitting on the terrace, says â€œI dont want to live through it.â€ Explains that his life recedes. Has had the best. We privately are so content. Bliss day after day. So happy cooking dinner, reading, playing bowls. No feeling of patriotism. How to go on, through war?â€”thats the question. Of course I have my old spurs & my old flanks. No I cant get at itâ€”so whats the use of staying out? One wanders in; dines; then listens. Sense tells me thereâ€™ll be no news till tomorrow. Yes, its a lovely still summer evening; not a sound. A swallow came into the sitting room. I talked to the girl who keeps elk hounds on the hill, by the ivy bloom tree. May flies buzz. Iâ€™m sleeveless in the heat. No word from Vita who was coming. How difficult, unexpectedly to write.
