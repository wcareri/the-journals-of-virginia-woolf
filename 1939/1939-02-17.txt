### Friday 17 February

Jangled with talkâ€”talk to David from 4 to 5; then to Katie Lewis; the Hambourgs, talk; home, & Raymond, Anna Freud, the Chilvers talk till 12.30â€”9 hours solid, frothy, talk, varied by buying Michelet at Nutts, & the Country of the Blind. A hammer & a drill this morning exacerbate still further: theyâ€™re pulling down Tâ avistock Sâ quare & building offices. So out in the brisk cold to buy note books. Iâ€™m starting my grand tour of literature. That is Iâ€™m going to write a book of discovery, reading as one pulls a string out; & must follow my trail through Sevigne Michelet Somerset Maugham &c. Thats the idea; encouraged by that vast marsupial Margery Strachey, who implored me to do criticism: as indeed Iâ€™ve long wanted. David grows friendlier: Raymondâ€”oh what a little bank clerk, snub, common, heâ€™s grown; hard as nails, & smug, with a new sawing motion with his hands, & none of the old flutter & sweetness. Severe is your toll, oh age. And I too shrivelled, & was very very old. Rachel waiting her child.
