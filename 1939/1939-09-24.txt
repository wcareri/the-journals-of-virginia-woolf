Stephen scribbling diaryâ€”no, reading Proust in English in the drawing room. Doubts thrown upon Gilbert White out here. Odd how the diffuse, expostulating, exaggerating young disturb my atmosphere. Yet I shall get back. Iâ€™ve talked miles since last night, in spite of Stephenâ€™s colic. A loose jointed mindâ€”misty, clouded, suffusive. Nothing has outline. Very sensitive, tremulous, receptive & striding. So weâ€™ve rambled over Inez: can she forgive herself. She has taken his money. Can she still be generous & large minded? over religion, at breakfast; over justice; & walking the terrace, we plunged & skimmed & hoppedâ€”from sodomy & women & writing & anonymity &â€”I forget. At last I said I must writeâ€”thoâ€™ my little bowl was clouded & troubled by all this talkâ€”& he must write; & so ordered boiled potatoes for his lunch; & sit in semi-retreat out here, re-typing without much conviction, Gâ ilbert Wâ hite for the N.S. My own flurry & responsiveness is an awful boreâ€”I can catch so many rumours & reverberate so instantaneously.

Freud is dead, the stop press says. Only these little facts interrupt the monotonous boom of the war. I get restless now & then & wd. like to be rubbing my back against London. And so must take a turn on the terrace, throw away my cigarette & go in to more rambling & discursive sauntering over all the countries of the mind. Yet, he says, I like the finished the definite: Bach & Gluck: then why sprawl so? But a very sensitive considerate manâ€”not condensed into anything. And tremulous. And fertile. & I suppose poetical. Yet discriminating. John a bit coarse, obtuse. He has bought for Â£5 in the Ladbroke Road a press & type. Talk of starting a magazine. I read his MSS poemsâ€”all repetitions & gradual beatings out, mostly unintelligible. WhÃ©n I say we must discuss our works, without caring for praise, am I sincere? Could I do it? Never mind. Forge ahead, in my own little way.
