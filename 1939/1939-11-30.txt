### Thursday 30 November

Very jaded & tired & depressed & cross, & so take the liberty of expressing my feelings here. R. a failureâ€”& what a grind â€¦ no more of that. Iâ€™m brain fagged & must resist the desire to tear up & cross outâ€”must fill my mind with air & light, & walk & blanket it in fog. Rubber boots helpâ€”I can flounder over the marsh. No I will write a little memoir.
