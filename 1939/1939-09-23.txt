### Saturday 23 September

Meanwhile Poland has been gobbled up. Russia & Germany divide it. An aircraft carrier has been sunk. But there have been no raids. And Iâ€”having said impulsively that I would write for the NS by way of using my faculties patrioticallyâ€”have written 2 & used up every morning to the margin. Also people have been staying here â€¦ oh such a fritter & agitationâ€”solid weekends with Mrs Nicholls, Miss Perkins, Miss Woodwardâ€”both very good samples: public house life & greengrocers. So distracted Iâ€™ve scudded over the surface of the days. And now Stephen is on us alone; & so we shall be lip sore & addle headed. Then theres John on Monday.

Civilisation has shrunk. The Amenities are wilting. Theres no petrol today: so we are back again with our bicycles at Asheham 1915. And once more L. & I calculate our income. Can I give A. her allowance? How much must we both earn? Once more we are journalists. Iâ€™ve offered to do an article, required by The Times, on artists & the crisis; offered others. My old age of independence is thus in danger. But in fact its hard to keep aloof & do my books. Theres a pressure about an articleâ€”even White & Bewickâ€”that keeps one absorbed. But how sick of 1500 words by Wednesday I shall get!

Then one begins stinting paper, sugar, butter, buying little hoards of matches. The elm tree that fell has been cut up. This will see us through 2 winters. They say the war will last 3 years. We had an SOS from Kingsley. He came for the night. What was it he cdnâ€™t say on the telephone? Nothing. Should he come out in favour of peace? Chaâ mberlain has the terms in his pocket. All in the know say we are beaten. Troops guard the East end. A bombâ€”& he means to bomb the docksâ€”will lead to revolution. He was happyâ€”but chuckling, quick & low, like a delirious bird. Always seeing himself, & pleased to see himself a martyr. Nothing of the least importance is said though in his article. A sensationalistâ€”his mind rotted with hot coterie talkâ€”all pitted & soft as a hot disâ hclothâ€”steaming, unwholesome, unreal. Yet I rather liked himâ€”a Celt.

I forget who else has been. Nessa painting L. Drove to Newhaven yesterday to buy plaster of Paris for Q. & we saw the 2 hospital ships painted green & white in the harbour. Many games of bowls. No reading. No Theophrastusâ€”only article reading. But this must be stopped, as Iâ€™m now up to time with my little flutterers; & thank God old Mabel who is like one of the clammy kitchen flies, goes back on Tuesday. London no worse, she says than anywhere. An opinion I encourage.
