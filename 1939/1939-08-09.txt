### Wednesday 9 August

My grind has left me dazed & depressed. How on earth to bring off this chapter? God knows.

Percy gave notice yesterday. Something about leaving lilies in the shed did the trick. You dont like what I doâ€”&c â€¦ Whether final or not, God knows, & we dont much care. These things always blow up once every other year. To Miss Robins today. A yeasty frowsty August in weather. Iâ€™m beaten nightly at bowls. Must air my head before lunch.
