### Saturday 9 December

I suppose that is the date. It is a Saturday morning, & looks fine & still, after the broken whirlpool of weather yesterday. We took Louie to Lewes to have teeth out, & it was blackout driving for the first time. Like fog driving, one cant see people. All the cars have small red eyes. The margins of the road are lost. But Iâ€™m thinking of a dozen things as usual. Should I begin my Forum article with a definition of angle, to explain my angularity? Ideas pullulate, but escape when I try to catch them here. Freud is upsetting: reducing one to whirlpool; & I daresay truly. If weâ€™re all instinct, the unconscious, whats all this about civilisation, the whole man, freedom &c? His savagery against God good. The falseness of loving oneâ€™s neighbours. The conscience as censor. Hate â€¦ But Iâ€™m too mixed. Iâ€™m going to begin Mill on Liberty. Iâ€™m making up for the hurried London years; spreading my mind, calmly to take in things wholly. Only thats Louie ringing for lunch. And L. is irritated with Percyâ€”all the bulbs dug up when we were in London. And then Raymond wants me to write. And Shena is writing something for meâ€”took that random shot to heart. Iâ€™m driving so many horses in my team. Probably we get 1100 (gross) from Stella. A great hare is hung in the kitchen, odd that we shall eat it. So, these are the little wild ponies that tug me so many ways at once. And I shall walk myself calm this afternoon.
