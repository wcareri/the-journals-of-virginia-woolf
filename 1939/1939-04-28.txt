### Friday 28 April

Very much screwed in the brain by trying to get Rogerâ€™s marriage chapter into shape; & also warmed by L. saying last night that he was fonder of me than I of him. A discussion as to which would mind the otherâ€™s death most. He said he depended more upon our common life than I did. He gave the garden as an instance. He said I lived more in a world of my own. I go for long walks alone. So we argued. I was very happy to think I was so much needed. Its strange how seldom one feels this: yet â€˜life in commonâ€™ is an immense reality. For instance, I cant go to The Wreckers tonight with Ethel Smyth because: 1. I have a little temperature: 2: (& more serious) Iâ€™d rather stay at home with L. Its no use fighting against this. Its one of the facts.

Oh such a dismal tea with Mrs W. yesterday. She is completely lifelessâ€”like an old weed on a rock. And always recurring to the complaints. That was how, by the way, we came to discuss our deaths. L. said he hoped he would predecease me. Her lonely old age is so intolerable. But its lonely, he said, because she has adopted an unreal attitude. Lived in a sentimâ entâ al make believe. Sees herself as the adored matriarch, & forces the children to adopt her attitude. Hence the unreality of all relations. This obsession of hers has also shut her off from all other interests: doesnâ€™t care for any impersonal thingâ€”art, music, books. Wont have a companion or reader; must depend on her sons. Constant innuendoes therefore about the goodness of Herbert & Harold; inference that L. neglects her; hints that I have taken him away from his family; absorbed him in mine. So in that crowded pink hot room we sat for 2 hours trying to beat up subjects for conversation. And there were awful silences, & our heads filled with wool; & all was dusty, dreary, old, & hopeless. Yet she followed us out on to the stair & made L. swear that she looks betterâ€”â€œSure Len? Sure I look better?â€ as if she still clings hard to life & cant be removed. So to walk in the hail in Ken. Gardens; & see the cherry trees livid & lurid in the yellow storm haze. Very cold winter spring.
