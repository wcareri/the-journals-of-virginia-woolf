### Sunday 31 July

Human voices wake us & we drownâ€”quotations on hearing the telephone yesterday asking us to Charleston. Bunny there; Angelica moody; conversation however well beaten upâ€”Duncanâ€™s 480 canvases; new studio: N.â€™s bedroom on the garden; Q.â€™s potting shed. Talk about Rumours of war. Bunny described KMâ â€™s ague, or malaria: fever high on Monday; sub-normal on Wednesday when paper gone to press. L. caps with anecdotes. N. gives an account of McDougallâ€™s methods of selling pictures. How he wheedled Mr Schiff. Next Memoir meeting discussed. So home. Very cold & cloudyâ€”yet the downs aglow with corn much to my liking. Today theyve chipped off the pink brick & removed the greenhouse shed. Really a load off my eyeâ€”queer what a reliefâ€”to see the shape of the wall & the pink Jackmanna again. How my eye feels rested. Now for the mantelpiece question. Then lunch. My poor old head very feebleâ€”thoâ€™ why? Trying it on PH. Age is it? or Roger? Walk this afternoon, & so lull oneself asleep.
