### Saturday 24 June

Yes, London broke in fairly vigorously yesterday. Ocampo bringing Giselle Freund & all her apparatus, which was set up in the drawing room, & all the lit. gents & ladies shown on a sheet. On top of them house seersâ€”an old lady who was born at 52, & whose father had built this studio. And the upshot is, a sittingâ€”oh curse this petty vulgar photography-advertising stuntâ€”at 3. No getting out of it, with Okampo on the sofa, & Freund there in the flesh. So my afternoon is gone in the way to me most detestable & upsetting of all. A life sized life coloured animated photographâ€”however L. is drawn in. Also, on top of this, sheets of evasion & dishonesty from Gollancz; & John; & Nessa about Angelica. She is in a nursing home with an infected kidney. All the old anxieties rampantâ€”for Nessa again. And old Mrs W. this afternoon. And Tom & a friendâ€”& Sarton. I suppose thereâ€™s stir in it; & stimulus; but Iâ€™m bothered about the PIPsâ€”cant get into the right mood; & its so laboured, & I cant, without a mood, toss it & lighten it: yet must somehow drive throâ€™ to the end.

Now to prepare for photography. Such are oneâ€™s friendsâ€”& their deformities.
