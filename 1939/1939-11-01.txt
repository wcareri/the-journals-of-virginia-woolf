### Wednesday 1 November

Oh how gladly I reach for this free page for a 10 minutes scamper after copying & re-copying, digging in those old extract books for quotes all the morning! And how ~~compose~~ adapt oneself to the sense of freedom? How compete with the compression & lucidity & logic of Gide writing his Journal? Well, the plain truth is I cant. Yet ideas shoot into my head perpetually. Only as my head is always on the anvilâ€”for I will finish this weekâ€”they skim away uncaught. It strikes me that Morgan probably keeps an admirable diary. Iâ€™d like to ask Morgan down. Our week ends are now taking the place of our dinners. Rather a laborious extension. But here we are settling in, very steadily, to a country life, & thereâ€™s much to be said for it. The space, the concentration, the freedom. Every day on my walk I get a colour bath: the greens dying, the winter colours burnishing. Society too is fairly brisk. There was Raymond (green trousers) Dora Morris (yellow jersey) at Câ harleston last Sunday. Clive with his hair cut abrupt & truculent. Janiceâ€™s car has come. We are as free as before almost with our double ration. The car bucks & is draughty. We went to Tun. Wells on 30 October. Here am I evading ideas. One of these days I shall be free to write them. Tonight L. lectures to the new village group on Democracy. The village is hungry for lectures. Tom comes for the week end. Eddy Sackville invites himself for next week. London & 37 recede. Dim voices reach us. No war news. An admirable naval man broadcast about a convoy. And its grey & misty.
