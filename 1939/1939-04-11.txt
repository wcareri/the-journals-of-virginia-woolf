### Tuesday 11 April

How much identity, to use my own private slang, is needed to surmount a little hillock: for instance, Lydia on Lappin & Lapinova yesterday at Tilton; & Tiltonâ€™s comfort, & quiet; all seem to make it harder for me to get on with revising Roger. Revising Roger at the rate of 2 weeks to a chapter will take me 3 months. Then thereâ€™s the war. The finest Easter possible has this purple background. We wait like obedient children to hear what we shall be told when Parliament meets on Thursday. At Tilton we talked first medicine; Maynardâ€™s drastic cure by Plesch; then politics; five minutes left for Tomâ€™s play. Every day, save 2, somethingâ€™s turned up. Private peace is not accessible. Miss Robins tomorrow. Then Charleston. Then L.P. here. Maynard, even Maynard, cant find much thatâ€™s hopeful now that Italy has nipped off Albania save that theres a unity of hatred. The men women children dogs &c. are solid for war if war comes. But privatelyâ€”how one rockets between private & publicâ€”his eyes are bluer, his skin pinker, & he can walk without pain. Lydia has devoted herself to the treatment. They think Nessa suppresses Cliveâ€”wont have things out. Never will have anything out. But theâ n Lâ ydia is always on husbands sideâ€”a serf like spirit, natural in the circumstances. My allegiance is to N. & D. as usual: but I like all my friendsâ€”though not the taste of Tilton.

Roasting hot: birds a chirp: butterflies.

I am reading Dickens; by way of a refresher. How he lives; not writes: both a virtue & a fault. Like seeing something emerge; without containing mind. Yet the accuracy & even sometimes the penetrationâ€”into Miss Squeers & Miss Price & the farmer for exampleâ€”remarkable. I cant dip my critical mind, even if I try to. Then Iâ€™m reading SevignÃ©, professionally for that quick amalgamation of books that I intend. In future, Iâ€™m to write quick, intense, short books, & never be tied down. This is the way to keep off the settling down & refrigeration of old age. And to flout all preconceived theoriesâ€”For more & more I doubt if enough is known to sketch even probable lines, all too emphatic & conventional.

Maurice, the last of the Ll. Davies brothers is dead; & Margaret livesâ€”lives too carefully of life, I used to feel. Why drag on, always measuring & testing oneâ€™s little bit of strength & setting it easy tasks so as to accumulate years?

Also Iâ€™m reading Rochefoucauld. Thats the real point of my little Brown bookâ€”that it makes me readâ€”with a penâ€”following the scent: & read the good books; not the slither of MSS & the stridency of the young chawkingâ€”the word expresses callow bills agape & chatteringâ€”for sympathy. Chaucer I take at need. So if I had any timeâ€”but perhaps next week will be more solitudinousâ€”I should, if it werenâ€™t for the warâ€”glide my way up & up in to that exciting layer so rarely lived in: where my mind works so quick it seems asleep; like the aeroplane propellers. But I must retype the last Clifton passage; & so be quit for tomorrow & clear the decks for Cambridge. Rather good, I expect it is: condensed & moulded.
